norwood builder      the adventure of the dancing men      the adventure of the solitary cyclist      the adventure of the priory school      the adventure of black peter      the adventure of charles augustus milverton      the adventure of the six napoleons      the adventure of the three students      the adventure of the golden pince nez      the adventure of the missing three quarter      the adventure of the abbey grange      the adventure of the second stain the adventure of the empty house it was in the spring of the year  that all london was interested and the fashionable world dismayed  by the murder of the honourable ronald adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances  the public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came out in the police investigation  but a good deal was suppressed upon that occasion  since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts  only now  at the end of nearly ten years  am i allowed to supply those missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain  the crime was of interest in itself  but that interest was as nothing to me compared to the inconceivable sequel  which afforded me the greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life  even now after this long interval  i find myself thrilling as i think of it  and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy  amazement  and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind  let me say to that public  which has shown some interest in those glimpses which i have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very remarkable man  that they are not to blame me if i have not shared my knowledge with them  for i should have considered it my first duty to do so  had i not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips  which was only withdrawn upon the third of last month it can be imagined that my close intimacy with sherlock holmes had interested me deeply in crime  and that after his disappearance i never failed to read with care the various problems which came before the public  and i even attempted  more than once  for my own private satisfaction  to employ his methods in their solution  though with indifferent success  there was none  however  which appealed to me like this tragedy of ronald adair  as i read the evidence at the inquest which led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown  i realized more clearly than i had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the death of sherlock holmes  there were points about this strange business which would  i was sure  have specially appealed to him  and the efforts of the police would have been supplemented  or more probably anticipated  by the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in europe  all day  as i drove upon my round  i turned over the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate  at the risk of telling a twice told tale  i will recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest the honourable ronald adair was the second son of the earl of maynooth at that time governor of one of the australian colonies  adair s mother had returned from australia to undergo the operation for cataract  and she  her son ronald  and her daughter hilda were living together at  park lane  the youth moved in the best society had  so far as was known  no enemies and no particular vices  he had been engaged to miss edith woodley  of carstairs  but the engagement had been broken off by mutual consent some months before  and there was no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it  for the rest sic  the man s life moved in a narrow and conventional circle  for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional  yet it was upon this easy going young aristocrat that death came  in most strange and unexpected form  between the hours of ten and eleven twenty on the night of march  ronald adair was fond of cards playing continually  but never for such stakes as would hurt him  he was a member of the baldwin  the cavendish and the bagatelle card clubs  it was shown that  after dinner on the day of his death  he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club  he had also played there in the afternoon  the evidence of those who had played with him mr  murray  sir john hardy  and colonel moran showed that the game was whist  and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards adair might have lost five pounds  but not more  his fortune was a considerable one  and such a loss could not in any way affect him  he had played nearly every day at one club or other  but he was a cautious player  and usually rose a winner  it came out in evidence that  in partnership with colonel moran  he had actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting  some weeks before  from godfrey milner and lord balmoral  so much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest on the evening of the crime  he returned from the club exactly at ten his mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation  the servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second floor  generally used as his sitting room  she had lit a fire there  and as it smoked she had opened the window  no sound was heard from the room until eleven twenty  the hour of the return of lady maynooth and her daughter  desiring to say good night  she attempted to enter her son s room  the door was locked on the inside  and no answer could be got to their cries and knocking  help was obtained  and the door forced  the unfortunate young man was found lying near the table  his head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet  but no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room  on the table lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold  the money arranged in little piles of varying amount  there were some figures also upon a sheet of paper  with the names of some club friends opposite to them  from which it was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards a minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more complex  in the first place  no reason could be given why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside  there was the possibility that the murderer had done this  and had afterwards escaped by the window  the drop was at least twenty feet  however  and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay beneath  neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed  nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road apparently  therefore  it was the young man himself who had fastened the door  but how did he come by his death  no one could have climbed up to the window without leaving traces  suppose a man had fired through the window  he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound  again  park lane is a frequented thoroughfare  there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house no one had heard a shot  and yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet  which had mushroomed out  as soft nosed bullets will and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death such were the circumstances of the park lane mystery  which were further complicated by entire absence of motive  since  as i have said  young adair was not known to have any enemy  and no attempt had been made to remove the money or valuables in the room all day i turned these facts over in my mind  endeavouring to hit upon some theory which could reconcile them all  and to find that line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the starting point of every investigation  i confess that i made little progress  in the evening i strolled across the park  and found myself about six o clock at the oxford street end of park lane  a group of loafers upon the pavements  all staring up at a particular window directed me to the house which i had come to see  a tall  thin man with coloured glasses  whom i strongly suspected of being a plain clothes detective  was pointing out some theory of his own  while the others crowded round to listen to what he said  i got as near him as i could but his observations seemed to me to be absurd  so i withdrew again in some disgust  as i did so i struck against an elderly  deformed man who had been behind me  and i knocked down several books which he was carrying  i remember that as i picked them up  i observed the title of one of them  the origin of tree worship  and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile  who  either as a trade or as a hobby  was a collector of obscure volumes  i endeavoured to apologize for the accident  but it was evident that these books which i had so unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner  with a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel  and i saw his curved back and white side whiskers disappear among the throng my observations of no   park lane did little to clear up the problem in which i was interested  the house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing  the whole not more than five feet high  it was perfectly easy  therefore  for anyone to get into the garden  but the window was entirely inaccessible  since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the most active man to climb it  more puzzled than ever  i retraced my steps to kensington  i had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me  to my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector  his sharp  wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair  and his precious volumes  a dozen of them at least  wedged under his right arm you re surprised to see me  sir  said he  in a strange  croaking voice i acknowledged that i was well  i ve a conscience  sir  and when i chanced to see you go into this house  as i came hobbling after you  i thought to myself  i ll just step in and see that kind gentleman  and tell him that if i was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant  and that i am much obliged to him for picking up my books you make too much of a trifle  said i  may i ask how you knew who i was well  sir  if it isn t too great a liberty  i am a neighbour of yours for you ll find my little bookshop at the corner of church street and very happy to see you  i am sure  maybe you collect yourself  sir here s british birds  and catullus  and the holy war a bargain  every one of them  with five volumes you could just fill that gap on that second shelf  it looks untidy  does it not  sir i moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me  when i turned again sherlock holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table  i rose to my feet  stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement  and then it appears that i must have fainted for the first and the last time in my life  certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes  and when it cleared i found my collar ends undone and the tingling after taste of brandy upon my lips  holmes was bending over my chair  his flask in his hand my dear watson  said the well remembered voice  i owe you a thousand apologies  i had no idea that you would be so affected i gripped him by the arms holmes  i cried  is it really you  can it indeed be that you are alive  is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful abyss wait a moment  said he  are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things  i have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance i am all right  but indeed  holmes  i can hardly believe my eyes  good heavens  to think that you you of all men should be standing in my study  again i gripped him by the sleeve  and felt the thin  sinewy arm beneath it  well  you re not a spirit anyhow  said i  my dear chap i m overjoyed to see you  sit down  and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm he sat opposite to me  and lit a cigarette in his old  nonchalant manner  he was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant  but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books upon the table  holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old  but there was a dead white tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a healthy one i am glad to stretch myself  watson  said he  it is no joke when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end now  my dear fellow  in the matter of these explanations  we have  if i may ask for your cooperation  a hard and dangerous night s work in front of us  perhaps it would be better if i gave you an account of the whole situation when that work is finished i am full of curiosity  i should much prefer to hear now you ll come with me to night when you like and where you like this is  indeed  like the old days  we shall have time for a mouthful of dinner before we need go  well  then  about that chasm  i had no serious difficulty in getting out of it  for the very simple reason that i never was in it you never were in it no  watson  i never was in it  my note to you was absolutely genuine i had little doubt that i had come to the end of my career when i perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late professor moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety  i read an inexorable purpose in his gray eyes  i exchanged some remarks with him therefore  and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards received  i left it with my cigarette box and my stick  and i walked along the pathway  moriarty still at my heels  when i reached the end i stood at bay  he drew no weapon  but he rushed at me and threw his long arms around me  he knew that his own game was up  and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me  we tottered together upon the brink of the fall  i have some knowledge  however  of baritsu  or the japanese system of wrestling  which has more than once been very useful to me  i slipped through his grip  and he with a horrible scream kicked madly for a few seconds  and clawed the air with both his hands but for all his efforts he could not get his balance  and over he went with my face over the brink  i saw him fall for a long way  then he struck a rock  bounded off  and splashed into the water i listened with amazement to this explanation  which holmes delivered between the puffs of his cigarette but the tracks  i cried  i saw  with my own eyes  that two went down the path and none returned it came about in this way  the instant that the professor had disappeared  it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance fate had placed in my way  i knew that moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death  there were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader they were all most dangerous men  one or other would certainly get me on the other hand  if all the world was convinced that i was dead they would take liberties  these men  they would soon lay themselves open and sooner or later i could destroy them  then it would be time for me to announce that i was still in the land of the living  so rapidly does the brain act that i believe i had thought this all out before professor moriarty had reached the bottom of the reichenbach fall i stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me  in your picturesque account of the matter  which i read with great interest some months later  you assert that the wall was sheer  that was not literally true  a few small footholds presented themselves  and there was some indication of a ledge  the cliff is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility  and it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path without leaving some tracks  i might  it is true have reversed my boots  as i have done on similar occasions  but the sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have suggested a deception  on the whole  then  it was best that i should risk the climb  it was not a pleasant business  watson  the fall roared beneath me  i am not a fanciful person  but i give you my word that i seemed to hear moriarty s voice screaming at me out of the abyss  a mistake would have been fatal  more than once  as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock  i thought that i was gone  but i struggled upward  and at last i reached a ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss  where i could lie unseen  in the most perfect comfort  there i was stretched  when you  my dear watson  and all your following were investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death at last  when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous conclusions  you departed for the hotel  and i was left alone  i had imagined that i had reached the end of my adventures  but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store for me  a huge rock  falling from above  boomed past me  struck the path  and bounded over into the chasm  for an instant i thought that it was an accident  but a moment later  looking up  i saw a man s head against the darkening sky  and another stone struck the very ledge upon which i was stretched  within a foot of my head  of course  the meaning of this was obvious  moriarty had not been alone  a confederate and even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate was had kept guard while the professor had attacked me  from a distance  unseen by me  he had been a witness of his friend s death and of my escape  he had waited  and then making his way round to the top of the cliff  he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed i did not take long to think about it  watson  again i saw that grim face look over the cliff  and i knew that it was the precursor of another stone  i scrambled down on to the path  i don t think i could have done it in cold blood  it was a hundred times more difficult than getting up  but i had no time to think of the danger  for another stone sang past me as i hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge  halfway down i slipped  but  by the blessing of god  i landed  torn and bleeding  upon the path  i took to my heels  did ten miles over the mountains in the darkness  and a week later i found myself in florence with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me i had only one confidant my brother mycroft  i owe you many apologies my dear watson  but it was all important that it should be thought i was dead  and it is quite certain that you would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought that it was true  several times during the last three years i have taken up my pen to write to you  but always i feared lest your affectionate regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my secret  for that reason i turned away from you this evening when you upset my books  for i was in danger at the time  and any show of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results  as to mycroft  i had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which i needed  the course of events in london did not run so well as i had hoped  for the trial of the moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members  my own most vindictive enemies  at liberty  i travelled for two years in tibet  therefore  and amused myself by visiting lhassa and spending some days with the head lama  you may have read of the remarkable explorations of a norwegian named sigerson  but i am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend  i then passed through persia  looked in at mecca  and paid a short but interesting visit to the khalifa at khartoum the results of which i have communicated to the foreign office  returning to france  i spent some months in a research into the coal tar derivatives  which i conducted in a laboratory at montpellier  in the south of france  having concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in london  i was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable park lane mystery which not only appealed to me by its own merits  but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities  i came over at once to london  called in my own person at baker street  threw mrs  hudson into violent hysterics  and found that mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been  so it was  my dear watson  that at two o clock to day i found myself in my old armchair in my own old room  and only wishing that i could have seen my old friend watson in the other chair which he has so often adorned such was the remarkable narrative to which i listened on that april evening a narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall  spare figure and the keen  eager face  which i had never thought to see again  in some manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement  and his sympathy was shown in his manner rather than in his words  work is the best antidote to sorrow  my dear watson  said he  and i have a piece of work for us both to night which  if we can bring it to a successful conclusion  will in itself justify a man s life on this planet  in vain i begged him to tell me more  you will hear and see enough before morning  he answered  we have three years of the past to discuss  let that suffice until half past nine  when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house it was indeed like old times when  at that hour  i found myself seated beside him in a hansom  my revolver in my pocket  and the thrill of adventure in my heart  holmes was cold and stern and silent  as the gleam of the street lamps flashed upon his austere features  i saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed  i knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal london  but i was well assured  from the bearing of this master huntsman  that the adventure was a most grave one while the sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good for the object of our quest i had imagined that we were bound for baker street  but holmes stopped the cab at the corner of cavendish square  i observed that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right and left  and at every subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was not followed  our route was certainly a singular one  holmes s knowledge of the byways of london was extraordinary  and on this occasion he passed rapidly and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables  the very existence of which i had never known  we emerged at last into a small road  lined with old  gloomy houses  which led us into manchester street  and so to blandford street  here he turned swiftly down a narrow passage  passed through a wooden gate into a deserted yard  and then opened with a key the back door of a house  we entered together  and he closed it behind us the place was pitch dark  but it was evident to me that it was an empty house  our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking  and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in ribbons  holmes s cold  thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall  until i dimly saw the murky fanlight over the door  here holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves in a large  square  empty room  heavily shadowed in the corners  but faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond  there was no lamp near  and the window was thick with dust  so that we could only just discern each other s figures within  my companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear do you know where we are  he whispered surely that is baker street  i answered  staring through the dim window exactly  we are in camden house  which stands opposite to our own old quarters but why are we here because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile  might i trouble you  my dear watson  to draw a little nearer to the window taking every precaution not to show yourself  and then to look up at our old rooms the starting point of so many of your little fairy tales  we will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you i crept forward and looked across at the familiar window  as my eyes fell upon it  i gave a gasp and a cry of amazement  the blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room  the shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard  black outline upon the luminous screen of the window  there was no mistaking the poise of the head  the squareness of the shoulders  the sharpness of the features the face was turned half round  and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame  it was a perfect reproduction of holmes  so amazed was i that i threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me  he was quivering with silent laughter well  said he good heavens  i cried  it is marvellous i trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety said he  and i recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the artist takes in his own creation  it really is rather like me  is it not i should be prepared to swear that it was you the credit of the execution is due to monsieur oscar meunier  of grenoble  who spent some days in doing the moulding  it is a bust in wax  the rest i arranged myself during my visit to baker street this afternoon but why because  my dear watson  i had the strongest possible reason for wishing certain people to think that i was there when i was really elsewhere and you thought the rooms were watched i knew that they were watched by whom by my old enemies  watson  by the charming society whose leader lies in the reichenbach fall  you must remember that they knew  and only they knew  that i was still alive  sooner or later they believed that i should come back to my rooms  they watched them continuously  and this morning they saw me arrive how do you know because i recognized their sentinel when i glanced out of my window  he is a harmless enough fellow  parker by name  a garroter by trade  and a remarkable performer upon the jew s harp  i cared nothing for him  but i cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind him  the bosom friend of moriarty  the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff  the most cunning and dangerous criminal in london  that is the man who is after me to night watson  and that is the man who is quite unaware that we are after him my friend s plans were gradually revealing themselves  from this convenient retreat  the watchers were being watched and the trackers tracked  that angular shadow up yonder was the bait  and we were the hunters  in silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us  holmes was silent and motionless  but i could tell that he was keenly alert  and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passers by  it was a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the long street  many people were moving to and fro  most of them muffled in their coats and cravats  once or twice it seemed to me that i had seen the same figure before  and i especially noticed two men who appeared to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house some distance up the street  i tried to draw my companion s attention to them  but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience  and continued to stare into the street  more than once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall  it was evident to me that he was becoming uneasy  and that his plans were not working out altogether as he had hoped  at last  as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared  he paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation  i was about to make some remark to him  when i raised my eyes to the lighted window  and again experienced almost as great a surprise as before  i clutched holmes s arm  and pointed upward the shadow has moved  i cried it was indeed no longer the profile  but the back  which was turned towards us three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own of course it has moved  said he  am i such a farcical bungler watson  that i should erect an obvious dummy  and expect that some of the sharpest men in europe would be deceived by it  we have been in this room two hours  and mrs  hudson has made some change in that figure eight times  or once in every quarter of an hour  she works it from the front  so that her shadow may never be seen  ah  he drew in his breath with a shrill  excited intake  in the dim light i saw his head thrown forward  his whole attitude rigid with attention  outside the street was absolutely deserted  those two men might still be crouching in the doorway  but i could no longer see them  all was still and dark  save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre  again in the utter silence i heard that thin sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement  an instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room  and i felt his warning hand upon my lips  the fingers which clutched me were quivering  never had i known my friend more moved  and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us but suddenly i was aware of that which his keener senses had already distinguished  a low  stealthy sound came to my ears  not from the direction of baker street  but from the back of the very house in which we lay concealed  a door opened and shut  an instant later steps crept down the passage steps which were meant to be silent  but which reverberated harshly through the empty house  holmes crouched back against the wall  and i did the same  my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver  peering through the gloom  i saw the vague outline of a man  a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door  he stood for an instant  and then he crept forward  crouching  menacing  into the room  he was within three yards of us  this sinister figure  and i had braced myself to meet his spring  before i realized that he had no idea of our presence  he passed close beside us  stole over to the window and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot  as he sank to the level of this opening  the light of the street  no longer dimmed by the dusty glass  fell full upon his face  the man seemed to be beside himself with excitement  his two eyes shone like stars  and his features were working convulsively  he was an elderly man  with a thin projecting nose  a high  bald forehead  and a huge grizzled moustache an opera hat was pushed to the back of his head  and an evening dress shirt front gleamed out through his open overcoat  his face was gaunt and swarthy  scored with deep  savage lines  in his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick  but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang  then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object  and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud sharp click  as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place  still kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever  with the result that there came a long whirling  grinding noise  ending once more in a powerful click  he straightened himself then  and i saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun  with a curiously misshapen butt  he opened it at the breech  put something in  and snapped the breech lock  then  crouching down  he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window and i saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered along the sights  i heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder  and saw that amazing target the black man on the yellow ground  standing clear at the end of his foresight  for an instant he was rigid and motionless  then his finger tightened on the trigger  there was a strange  loud whiz and a long silvery tinkle of broken glass  at that instant holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksman s back  and hurled him flat upon his face  he was up again in a moment  and with convulsive strength he seized holmes by the throat  but i struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver  and he dropped again upon the floor  i fell upon him  and as i held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle  there was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement  and two policemen in uniform with one plain clothes detective  rushed through the front entrance and into the room that you  lestrade  said holmes yes  mr  holmes  i took the job myself  it s good to see you back in london  sir i think you want a little unofficial help  three undetected murders in one year won t do  lestrade  but you handled the molesey mystery with less than your usual that s to say  you handled it fairly well we had all risen to our feet  our prisoner breathing hard  with a stalwart constable on each side of him  already a few loiterers had begun to collect in the street  holmes stepped up to the window  closed it  and dropped the blinds  lestrade had produced two candles  and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns  i was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner it was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned towards us  with the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a sensualist below  the man must have started with great capacities for good or for evil  but one could not look upon his cruel blue eyes  with their drooping  cynical lids  or upon the fierce  aggressive nose and the threatening  deep lined brow  without reading nature s plainest danger signals  he took no heed of any of us  but his eyes were fixed upon holmes s face with an expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended  you fiend  he kept on muttering  you clever  clever fiend ah  colonel  said holmes  arranging his rumpled collar  journeys end in lovers  meetings  as the old play says  i don t think i have had the pleasure of seeing you since you favoured me with those attentions as i lay on the ledge above the reichenbach fall the colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance  you cunning  cunning fiend  was all that he could say i have not introduced you yet  said holmes  this  gentlemen  is colonel sebastian moran  once of her majesty s indian army  and the best heavy game shot that our eastern empire has ever produced  i believe i am correct colonel  in saying that your bag of tigers still remains unrivalled the fierce old man said nothing  but still glared at my companion  with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was wonderfully like a tiger himself i wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a shikari said holmes  it must be very familiar to you  have you not tethered a young kid under a tree  lain above it with your rifle  and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger  this empty house is my tree  and you are my tiger  you have possibly had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers  or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you  these  he pointed around  are my other guns  the parallel is exact colonel moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage  but the constables dragged him back  the fury upon his face was terrible to look at i confess that you had one small surprise for me  said holmes  i did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this empty house and this convenient front window  i had imagined you as operating from the street  where my friend  lestrade and his merry men were awaiting you with that exception  all has gone as i expected colonel moran turned to the official detective you may or may not have just cause for arresting me  said he  but at least there can be no reason why i should submit to the gibes of this person  if i am in the hands of the law  let things be done in a legal way well  that s reasonable enough  said lestrade  nothing further you have to say  mr  holmes  before we go holmes had picked up the powerful air gun from the floor  and was examining its mechanism an admirable and unique weapon  said he  noiseless and of tremendous power  i knew von herder  the blind german mechanic  who constructed it to the order of the late professor moriarty  for years i have been aware of its existence though i have never before had the opportunity of handling it  i commend it very specially to your attention  lestrade and also the bullets which fit it you can trust us to look after that  mr  holmes  said lestrade  as the whole party moved towards the door  anything further to say only to ask what charge you intend to prefer what charge  sir  why  of course  the attempted murder of mr  sherlock holmes not so  lestrade  i do not propose to appear in the matter at all  to you  and to you only  belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected  yes  lestrade  i congratulate you  with your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity  you have got him got him  got whom  mr  holmes the man that the whole force has been seeking in vain colonel sebastian moran  who shot the honourable ronald adair with an expanding bullet from an air gun through the open window of the second floor front of no   park lane  upon the thirtieth of last month  that s the charge  lestrade  and now  watson  if you can endure the draught from a broken window  i think that half an hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable amusement our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision of mycroft holmes and the immediate care of mrs  hudson  as i entered i saw  it is true  an unwonted tidiness  but the old landmarks were all in their place  there were the chemical corner and the acid stained deal topped table  there upon a shelf was the row of formidable scrap books and books of reference which many of our fellow citizens would have been so glad to burn  the diagrams  the violin case  and the pipe rack even the persian slipper which contained the tobacco all met my eyes as i glanced round me  there were two occupants of the room one  mrs  hudson  who beamed upon us both as we entered the other  the strange dummy which had played so important a part in the evening s adventures  it was a wax coloured model of my friend  so admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile  it stood on a small pedestal table with an old dressing gown of holmes s so draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely perfect i hope you observed all precautions  mrs  hudson  said holmes i went to it on my knees  sir  just as you told me excellent  you carried the thing out very well  did you observe where the bullet went yes  sir  i m afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust  for it passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall  i picked it up from the carpet  here it is holmes held it out to me  a soft revolver bullet  as you perceive watson  there s genius in that  for who would expect to find such a thing fired from an airgun  all right  mrs  hudson  i am much obliged for your assistance  and now  watson  let me see you in your old seat once more  for there are several points which i should like to discuss with you he had thrown off the seedy frockcoat  and now he was the holmes of old in the mouse coloured dressing gown which he took from his effigy the old shikari s nerves have not lost their steadiness  nor his eyes their keenness  said he  with a laugh  as he inspected the shattered forehead of his bust plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through the brain  he was the best shot in india  and i expect that there are few better in london  have you heard the name no  i have not well  well  such is fame  but  then  if i remember right  you had not heard the name of professor james moriarty  who had one of the great brains of the century  just give me down my index of biographies from the shelf he turned over the pages lazily  leaning back in his chair and blowing great clouds from his cigar my collection of m s is a fine one  said he  moriarty himself is enough to make any letter illustrious  and here is morgan the poisoner and merridew of abominable memory  and mathews  who knocked out my left canine in the waiting room at charing cross  and  finally  here is our friend of to night he handed over the book  and i read moran  sebastian  colonel  unemployed  formerly st bangalore pioneers born london   son of sir augustus moran  c  b  once british minister to persia  educated eton and oxford  served in jowaki campaign afghan campaign  charasiab despatches  sherpur  and cabul  author of heavy game of the western himalayas  three months in the jungle  address  conduit street  clubs  the anglo indian  the tankerville  the bagatelle card club on the margin was written  in holmes s precise hand the second most dangerous man in london this is astonishing  said i  as i handed back the volume  the man s career is that of an honourable soldier it is true  holmes answered  up to a certain point he did well  he was always a man of iron nerve  and the story is still told in india how he crawled down a drain after a wounded man eating tiger  there are some trees  watson  which grow to a certain height  and then suddenly develop some unsightly eccentricity  you will see it often in humans  i have a theory that the individual represents in his development the whole procession of his ancestors  and that such a sudden turn to good or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line of his pedigree  the person becomes  as it were  the epitome of the history of his own family it is surely rather fanciful well  i don t insist upon it  whatever the cause  colonel moran began to go wrong  without any open scandal  he still made india too hot to hold him  he retired  came to london  and again acquired an evil name  it was at this time that he was sought out by professor moriarty to whom for a time he was chief of the staff  moriarty supplied him liberally with money  and used him only in one or two very high class jobs  which no ordinary criminal could have undertaken  you may have some recollection of the death of mrs  stewart  of lauder  in not  well  i am sure moran was at the bottom of it  but nothing could be proved  so cleverly was the colonel concealed that  even when the moriarty gang was broken up  we could not incriminate him  you remember at that date  when i called upon you in your rooms  how i put up the shutters for fear of air guns  no doubt you thought me fanciful  i knew exactly what i was doing  for i knew of the existence of this remarkable gun  and i knew also that one of the best shots in the world would be behind it  when we were in switzerland he followed us with moriarty and it was undoubtedly he who gave me that evil five minutes on the reichenbach ledge you may think that i read the papers with some attention during my sojourn in france  on the look out for any chance of laying him by the heels  so long as he was free in london  my life would really not have been worth living  night and day the shadow would have been over me  and sooner or later his chance must have come  what could i do  i could not shoot him at sight  or i should myself be in the dock  there was no use appealing to a magistrate  they cannot interfere on the strength of what would appear to them to be a wild suspicion  so i could do nothing  but i watched the criminal news  knowing that sooner or later i should get him  then came the death of this ronald adair  my chance had come at last  knowing what i did  was it not certain that colonel moran had done it  he had played cards with the lad  he had followed him home from the club  he had shot him through the open window  there was not a doubt of it  the bullets alone are enough to put his head in a noose  i came over at once  i was seen by the sentinel  who would  i knew  direct the colonel s attention to my presence  he could not fail to connect my sudden return with his crime  and to be terribly alarmed  i was sure that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once  and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose  i left him an excellent mark in the window  and  having warned the police that they might be needed by the way  watson  you spotted their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracy i took up what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation  never dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack  now  my dear watson  does anything remain for me to explain yes  said i  you have not made it clear what was colonel moran s motive in murdering the honourable ronald adair ah  my dear watson  there we come into those realms of conjecture where the most logical mind may be at fault  each may form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence  and yours is as likely to be correct as mine you have formed one  then i think that it is not difficult to explain the facts  it came out in evidence that colonel moran and young adair had  between them  won a considerable amount of money  now  moran undoubtedly played foul of that i have long been aware  i believe that on the day of the murder adair had discovered that moran was cheating  very likely he had spoken to him privately  and had threatened to expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the club  and promised not to play cards again  it is unlikely that a youngster like adair would at once make a hideous scandal by exposing a well known man so much older than himself probably he acted as i suggest  the exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin to moran  who lived by his ill gotten card gains  he therefore murdered adair  who at the time was endeavouring to work out how much money he should himself return  since he could not profit by his partner s foul play  he locked the door lest the ladies should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing with these names and coins  will it pass i have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth it will be verified or disproved at the trial  meanwhile  come what may  colonel moran will trouble us no more  the famous air gun of von herder will embellish the scotland yard museum  and once again mr  sherlock holmes is free to devote his life to examining those interesting little problems which the complex life of london so plentifully presents the adventure of the norwood builder from the point of view of the criminal expert  said mr  sherlock holmes  london has become a singularly uninteresting city since the death of the late lamented professor moriarty i can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to agree with you  i answered well  well  i must not be selfish  said he  with a smile  as he pushed back his chair from the breakfast table  the community is certainly the gainer  and no one the loser  save the poor out of work specialist whose occupation has gone  with that man in the field  one s morning paper presented infinite possibilities  often it was only the smallest trace  watson  the faintest indication  and yet it was enough to tell me that the great malignant brain was there  as the gentlest tremors of the edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the centre  petty thefts  wanton assaults  purposeless outrage to the man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected whole  to the scientific student of the higher criminal world  no capital in europe offered the advantages which london then possessed  but now  he shrugged his shoulders in humorous deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so much to produce at the time of which i speak  holmes had been back for some months and i at his request had sold my practice and returned to share the old quarters in baker street  a young doctor  named verner  had purchased my small kensington practice  and given with astonishingly little demur the highest price that i ventured to ask an incident which only explained itself some years later  when i found that verner was a distant relation of holmes  and that it was my friend who had really found the money our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had stated for i find  on looking over my notes  that this period includes the case of the papers of ex president murillo  and also the shocking affair of the dutch steamship friesland  which so nearly cost us both our lives his cold and proud nature was always averse  however  from anything in the shape of public applause  and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no further word of himself  his methods  or his successes a prohibition which  as i have explained  has only now been removed mr  sherlock holmes was leaning back in his chair after his whimsical protest  and was unfolding his morning paper in a leisurely fashion when our attention was arrested by a tremendous ring at the bell followed immediately by a hollow drumming sound  as if someone were beating on the outer door with his fist  as it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the hall  rapid feet clattered up the stair  and an instant later a wild eyed and frantic young man  pale  disheveled  and palpitating  burst into the room  he looked from one to the other of us and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry i m sorry  mr  holmes  he cried  you mustn t blame me  i am nearly mad  mr  holmes  i am the unhappy john hector mcfarlane he made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both his visit and its manner  but i could see  by my companion s unresponsive face  that it meant no more to him than to me have a cigarette  mr  mcfarlane  said he  pushing his case across i am sure that  with your symptoms  my friend dr  watson here would prescribe a sedative  the weather has been so very warm these last few days  now  if you feel a little more composed  i should be glad if you would sit down in that chair  and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are  and what it is that you want  you mentioned your name  as if i should recognize it  but i assure you that  beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor  a solicitor  a freemason  and an asthmatic  i know nothing whatever about you familiar as i was with my friend s methods  it was not difficult for me to follow his deductions  and to observe the untidiness of attire  the sheaf of legal papers  the watch charm  and the breathing which had prompted them  our client  however  stared in amazement yes  i am all that  mr  holmes  and  in addition  i am the most unfortunate man at this moment in london  for heaven s sake  don t abandon me  mr  holmes  if they come to arrest me before i have finished my story  make them give me time  so that i may tell you the whole truth  i could go to jail happy if i knew that you were working for me outside arrest you  said holmes  this is really most grati most interesting on what charge do you expect to be arrested upon the charge of murdering mr  jonas oldacre  of lower norwood my companion s expressive face showed a sympathy which was not  i am afraid  entirely unmixed with satisfaction dear me  said he  it was only this moment at breakfast that i was saying to my friend  dr  watson  that sensational cases had disappeared out of our papers our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the daily telegraph  which still lay upon holmes s knee if you had looked at it  sir  you would have seen at a glance what the errand is on which i have come to you this morning  i feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every man s mouth  he turned it over to expose the central page  here it is  and with your permission i will read it to you  listen to this  mr  holmes  the headlines are mysterious affair at lower norwood  disappearance of a well known builder  suspicion of murder and arson  a clue to the criminal  that is the clue which they are already following  mr  holmes  and i know that it leads infallibly to me  i have been followed from london bridge station  and i am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant to arrest me  it will break my mother s heart it will break her heart he wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension  and swayed backward and forward in his chair i looked with interest upon this man  who was accused of being the perpetrator of a crime of violence  he was flaxen haired and handsome in a washed out negative fashion  with frightened blue eyes  and a clean shaven face  with a weak  sensitive mouth  his age may have been about twenty seven  his dress and bearing that of a gentleman  from the pocket of his light summer overcoat protruded the bundle of indorsed papers which proclaimed his profession we must use what time we have  said holmes  watson  would you have the kindness to take the paper and to read the paragraph in question underneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted  i read the following suggestive narrative late last night  or early this morning  an incident occurred at lower norwood which points  it is feared  to a serious crime  mr  jonas oldacre is a well known resident of that suburb  where he has carried on his business as a builder for many years  mr  oldacre is a bachelor fifty two years of age  and lives in deep dene house  at the sydenham end of the road of that name  he has had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits  secretive and retiring  for some years he has practically withdrawn from the business  in which he is said to have massed considerable wealth  a small timber yard still exists  however at the back of the house  and last night  about twelve o clock  an alarm was given that one of the stacks was on fire  the engines were soon upon the spot  but the dry wood burned with great fury  and it was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had been entirely consumed up to this point the incident bore the appearance of an ordinary accident  but fresh indications seem to point to serious crime  surprise was expressed at the absence of the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire  and an inquiry followed  which showed that he had disappeared from the house  an examination of his room revealed that the bed had not been slept in  that a safe which stood in it was open  that a number of important papers were scattered about the room  and finally that there were signs of a murderous struggle  slight traces of blood being found within the room  and an oaken walking stick  which also showed stains of blood upon the handle  it is known that mr  jonas oldacre had received a late visitor in his bedroom upon that night  and the stick found has been identified as the property of this person  who is a young london solicitor named john hector mcfarlane  junior partner of graham and mcfarlane  of  gresham buildings  e  c  the police believe that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very convincing motive for the crime  and altogether it cannot be doubted that sensational developments will follow later it is rumoured as we go to press that mr  john hector mcfarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the murder of mr  jonas oldacre  it is at least certain that a warrant has been issued  there have been further and sinister developments in the investigation at norwood  besides the signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it is now known that the french windows of his bedroom which is on the ground floor  were found to be open  that there were marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the wood pile  and finally  it is asserted that charred remains have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire  the police theory is that a most sensational crime has been committed  that the victim was clubbed to death in his own bedroom  his papers rifled  and his dead body dragged across to the wood stack  which was then ignited so as to hide all traces of the crime  the conduct of the criminal investigation has been left in the experienced hands of inspector lestrade  of scotland yard  who is following up the clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity sherlock holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together to this remarkable account the case has certainly some points of interest  said he  in his languid fashion  may i ask  in the first place  mr  mcfarlane  how it is that you are still at liberty  since there appears to be enough evidence to justify your arrest i live at torrington lodge  blackheath  with my parents  mr  holmes but last night  having to do business very late with mr  jonas oldacre i stayed at an hotel in norwood  and came to my business from there  i knew nothing of this affair until i was in the train  when i read what you have just heard  i at once saw the horrible danger of my position and i hurried to put the case into your hands  i have no doubt that i should have been arrested either at my city office or at my home  a man followed me from london bridge station  and i have no doubt great heaven  what is that it was a clang of the bell  followed instantly by heavy steps upon the stair  a moment later  our old friend lestrade appeared in the doorway over his shoulder i caught a glimpse of one or two uniformed policemen outside mr  john hector mcfarlane  said lestrade our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face i arrest you for the wilful murder of mr  jonas oldacre  of lower norwood mcfarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair  and sank into his chair once more like one who is crushed one moment  lestrade  said holmes  half an hour more or less can make no difference to you  and the gentleman was about to give us an account of this very interesting affair  which might aid us in clearing it up i think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up  said lestrade grimly none the less  with your permission  i should be much interested to hear his account well  mr  holmes  it is difficult for me to refuse you anything  for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past  and we owe you a good turn at scotland yard  said lestrade  at the same time i must remain with my prisoner  and i am bound to warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against him i wish nothing better  said our client  all i ask is that you should hear and recognize the absolute truth lestrade looked at his watch  i ll give you half an hour  said he i must explain first  said mcfarlane  that i knew nothing of mr jonas oldacre  his name was familiar to me  for many years ago my parents were acquainted with him  but they drifted apart  i was very much surprised therefore  when yesterday  about three o clock in the afternoon  he walked into my office in the city  but i was still more astonished when he told me the object of his visit  he had in his hand several sheets of a notebook  covered with scribbled writing here they are and he laid them on my table here is my will  said he  i want you  mr  mcfarlane  to cast it into proper legal shape  i will sit here while you do so i set myself to copy it  and you can imagine my astonishment when i found that  with some reservations  he had left all his property to me he was a strange little ferret like man  with white eyelashes  and when i looked up at him i found his keen gray eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression  i could hardly believe my own as i read the terms of the will  but he explained that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation  that he had known my parents in his youth  and that he had always heard of me as a very deserving young man  and was assured that his money would be in worthy hands  of course  i could only stammer out my thanks  the will was duly finished  signed  and witnessed by my clerk  this is it on the blue paper  and these slips  as i have explained  are the rough draft  mr  jonas oldacre then informed me that there were a number of documents building leases  title deeds mortgages  scrip  and so forth which it was necessary that i should see and understand  he said that his mind would not be easy until the whole thing was settled  and he begged me to come out to his house at norwood that night  bringing the will with me  and to arrange matters remember  my boy  not one word to your parents about the affair until everything is settled  we will keep it as a little surprise for them  he was very insistent upon this point  and made me promise it faithfully you can imagine  mr  holmes  that i was not in a humour to refuse him anything that he might ask  he was my benefactor  and all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular  i sent a telegram home therefore  to say that i had important business on hand  and that it was impossible for me to say how late i might be  mr  oldacre had told me that he would like me to have supper with him at nine  as he might not be home before that hour  i had some difficulty in finding his house however  and it was nearly half past before i reached it  i found him one moment  said holmes  who opened the door a middle aged woman  who was  i suppose  his housekeeper and it was she  i presume  who mentioned your name exactly  said mcfarlane pray proceed mcfarlane wiped his damp brow  and then continued his narrative i was shown by this woman into a sitting room  where a frugal supper was laid out  afterwards  mr  jonas oldacre led me into his bedroom  in which there stood a heavy safe  this he opened and took out a mass of documents  which we went over together  it was between eleven and twelve when we finished  he remarked that we must not disturb the housekeeper he showed me out through his own french window  which had been open all this time was the blind down  asked holmes i will not be sure  but i believe that it was only half down  yes  i remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the window  i could not find my stick  and he said  never mind  my boy  i shall see a good deal of you now  i hope  and i will keep your stick until you come back to claim it  i left him there  the safe open  and the papers made up in packets upon the table  it was so late that i could not get back to blackheath  so i spent the night at the anerley arms  and i knew nothing more until i read of this horrible affair in the morning anything more that you would like to ask  mr  holmes  said lestrade whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this remarkable explanation not until i have been to blackheath you mean to norwood  said lestrade oh  yes  no doubt that is what i must have meant  said holmes  with his enigmatical smile  lestrade had learned by more experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain could cut through that which was impenetrable to him  i saw him look curiously at my companion i think i should like to have a word with you presently  mr  sherlock holmes  said he  now  mr  mcfarlane  two of my constables are at the door  and there is a four wheeler waiting  the wretched young man arose  and with a last beseeching glance at us walked from the room  the officers conducted him to the cab  but lestrade remained holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of the will and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon his face there are some points about that document  lestrade  are there not said he  pushing them over the official looked at them with a puzzled expression i can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the second page  and one or two at the end  those are as clear as print  said he  but the writing in between is very bad  and there are three places where i cannot read it at all what do you make of that  said holmes well  what do you make of it that it was written in a train  the good writing represents stations the bad writing movement  and the very bad writing passing over points a scientific expert would pronounce at once that this was drawn up on a suburban line  since nowhere save in the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a succession of points  granting that his whole journey was occupied in drawing up the will  then the train was an express  only stopping once between norwood and london bridge lestrade began to laugh you are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories  mr holmes  said he  how does this bear on the case well  it corroborates the young man s story to the extent that the will was drawn up by jonas oldacre in his journey yesterday  it is curious is it not that a man should draw up so important a document in so haphazard a fashion  it suggests that he did not think it was going to be of much practical importance  if a man drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective  he might do it so well  he drew up his own death warrant at the same time  said lestrade oh  you think so don t you well  it is quite possible  but the case is not clear to me yet not clear  well  if that isn t clear  what could be clear  here is a young man who learns suddenly that  if a certain older man dies  he will succeed to a fortune  what does he do  he says nothing to anyone  but he arranges that he shall go out on some pretext to see his client that night  he waits until the only other person in the house is in bed  and then in the solitude of a man s room he murders him  burns his body in the wood pile  and departs to a neighbouring hotel  the blood stains in the room and also on the stick are very slight  it is probable that he imagined his crime to be a bloodless one  and hoped that if the body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his death traces which  for some reason  must have pointed to him  is not all this obvious it strikes me  my good lestrade  as being just a trifle too obvious said holmes  you do not add imagination to your other great qualities but if you could for one moment put yourself in the place of this young man  would you choose the very night after the will had been made to commit your crime  would it not seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between the two incidents  again  would you choose an occasion when you are known to be in the house  when a servant has let you in  and  finally  would you take the great pains to conceal the body  and yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal confess  lestrade  that all this is very unlikely as to the stick  mr  holmes  you know as well as i do that a criminal is often flurried  and does such things  which a cool man would avoid he was very likely afraid to go back to the room  give me another theory that would fit the facts i could very easily give you half a dozen  said holmes  here for example  is a very possible and even probable one  i make you a free present of it  the older man is showing documents which are of evident value  a passing tramp sees them through the window  the blind of which is only half down  exit the solicitor  enter the tramp  he seizes a stick  which he observes there  kills oldacre  and departs after burning the body why should the tramp burn the body for the matter of that  why should mcfarlane to hide some evidence possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had been committed and why did the tramp take nothing because they were papers that he could not negotiate lestrade shook his head  though it seemed to me that his manner was less absolutely assured than before well  mr  sherlock holmes  you may look for your tramp  and while you are finding him we will hold on to our man  the future will show which is right  just notice this point  mr  holmes  that so far as we know none of the papers were removed  and that the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for removing them  since he was heir at law and would come into them in any case my friend seemed struck by this remark i don t mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very strongly in favour of your theory  said he  i only wish to point out that there are other theories possible  as you say  the future will decide good morning  i dare say that in the course of the day i shall drop in at norwood and see how you are getting on when the detective departed  my friend rose and made his preparations for the day s work with the alert air of a man who has a congenial task before him my first movement watson  said he  as he bustled into his frockcoat must  as i said  be in the direction of blackheath and why not norwood because we have in this case one singular incident coming close to the heels of another singular incident  the police are making the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second  because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal  but it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first incident the curious will  so suddenly made  and to so unexpected an heir  it may do something to simplify what followed no  my dear fellow  i don t think you can help me  there is no prospect of danger  or i should not dream of stirring out without you  i trust that when i see you in the evening  i will be able to report that i have been able to do something for this unfortunate youngster  who has thrown himself upon my protection it was late when my friend returned  and i could see  by a glance at his haggard and anxious face  that the high hopes with which he had started had not been fulfilled  for an hour he droned away upon his violin endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits  at last he flung down the instrument  and plunged into a detailed account of his misadventures it s all going wrong  watson all as wrong as it can go  i kept a bold face before lestrade  but  upon my soul  i believe that for once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong  all my instincts are one way  and all the facts are the other  and i much fear that british juries have not yet attained that pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my theories over lestrade s facts did you go to blackheath yes  watson  i went there  and i found very quickly that the late lamented oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard  the father was away in search of his son  the mother was at home a little  fluffy blue eyed person  in a tremor of fear and indignation  of course  she would not admit even the possibility of his guilt  but she would not express either surprise or regret over the fate of oldacre  on the contrary  she spoke of him with such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably strengthening the case of the police for  of course  if her son had heard her speak of the man in this fashion  it would predispose him towards hatred and violence  he was more like a malignant and cunning ape than a human being  said she  and he always was  ever since he was a young man you knew him at that time  said i yes  i knew him well  in fact  he was an old suitor of mine  thank heaven that i had the sense to turn away from him and to marry a better  if poorer  man  i was engaged to him  mr  holmes  when i heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in an aviary  and i was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that i would have nothing more to do with him  she rummaged in a bureau  and presently she produced a photograph of a woman  shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife that is my own photograph  she said  he sent it to me in that state with his curse  upon my wedding morning well  said i  at least he has forgiven you now  since he has left all his property to your son neither my son nor i want anything from jonas oldacre  dead or alive she cried  with a proper spirit  there is a god in heaven  mr  holmes and that same god who has punished that wicked man will show  in his own good time  that my son s hands are guiltless of his blood well  i tried one or two leads  but could get at nothing which would help our hypothesis  and several points which would make against it  i gave it up at last and off i went to norwood this place  deep dene house  is a big modern villa of staring brick standing back in its own grounds  with a laurel clumped lawn in front of it  to the right and some distance back from the road was the timber yard which had been the scene of the fire  here s a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook  this window on the left is the one which opens into oldacre s room  you can look into it from the road  you see  that is about the only bit of consolation i have had to day  lestrade was not there  but his head constable did the honours  they had just found a great treasure trove  they had spent the morning raking among the ashes of the burned wood pile  and besides the charred organic remains they had secured several discoloured metal discs  i examined them with care  and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons  i even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of hyams  who was oldacres tailor  i then worked the lawn very carefully for signs and traces  but this drought has made everything as hard as iron  nothing was to be seen save that some body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which is in a line with the wood pile  all that  of course  fits in with the official theory  i crawled about the lawn with an august sun on my back  but i got up at the end of an hour no wiser than before well  after this fiasco i went into the bedroom and examined that also the blood stains were very slight  mere smears and discolourations  but undoubtedly fresh  the stick had been removed  but there also the marks were slight  there is no doubt about the stick belonging to our client he admits it  footmarks of both men could be made out on the carpet but none of any third person  which again is a trick for the other side  they were piling up their score all the time and we were at a standstill only one little gleam of hope did i get and yet it amounted to nothing  i examined the contents of the safe  most of which had been taken out and left on the table  the papers had been made up into sealed envelopes  one or two of which had been opened by the police  they were not  so far as i could judge  of any great value  nor did the bank book show that mr  oldacre was in such very affluent circumstances  but it seemed to me that all the papers were not there  there were allusions to some deeds possibly the more valuable which i could not find  this  of course  if we could definitely prove it  would turn lestrade s argument against himself  for who would steal a thing if he knew that he would shortly inherit it finally  having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent  i tried my luck with the housekeeper  mrs  lexington is her name a little dark  silent person  with suspicious and sidelong eyes  she could tell us something if she would i am convinced of it  but she was as close as wax  yes  she had let mr  mcfarlane in at half past nine  she wished her hand had withered before she had done so  she had gone to bed at half past ten  her room was at the other end of the house  and she could hear nothing of what had passed  mr  mcfarlane had left his hat  and to the best of her belief his stick  in the hall   she had been awakened by the alarm of fire  her poor  dear master had certainly been murdered  had he any enemies  well  every man had enemies  but mr  oldacre kept himself very much to himself  and only met people in the way of business  she had seen the buttons  and was sure that they belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night the wood pile was very dry  for it had not rained for a month  it burned like tinder  and by the time she reached the spot  nothing could be seen but flames  she and all the firemen smelled the burned flesh from inside it  she knew nothing of the papers  nor of mr  oldacre s private affairs so  my dear watson  there s my report of a failure  and yet and yet he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of conviction i know it s all wrong  i feel it in my bones  there is something that has not come out and that housekeeper knows it  there was a sort of sulky defiance in her eyes  which only goes with guilty knowledge  however  there s no good talking any more about it  watson  but unless some lucky chance comes our way i fear that the norwood disappearance case will not figure in that chronicle of our successes which i foresee that a patient public will sooner or later have to endure surely  said i  the man s appearance would go far with any jury that is a dangerous argument my dear watson  you remember that terrible murderer  bert stevens  who wanted us to get him off in  was there ever a more mild mannered  sunday school young man it is true unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory  this man is lost  you can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now be presented against him  and all further investigation has served to strengthen it by the way  there is one curious little point about those papers which may serve us as the starting point for an inquiry  on looking over the bank book i found that the low state of the balance was principally due to large checks which have been made out during the last year to mr cornelius  i confess that i should be interested to know who this mr  cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large transactions  is it possible that he has had a hand in the affair cornelius might be a broker  but we have found no scrip to correspond with these large payments  failing any other indication  my researches must now take the direction of an inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these checks  but i fear  my dear fellow  that our case will end ingloriously by lestrade hanging our client  which will certainly be a triumph for scotland yard i do not know how far sherlock holmes took any sleep that night  but when i came down to breakfast i found him pale and harassed  his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them  the carpet round his chair was littered with cigarette ends and with the early editions of the morning papers  an open telegram lay upon the table what do you think of this  watson  he asked  tossing it across it was from norwood  and ran as follows important fresh evidence to hand  mcfarlane s guilt definitely established  advise you to abandon case  lestrade this sounds serious  said i it is lestrade s little cock a doodle of victory  holmes answered with a bitter smile  and yet it may be premature to abandon the case after all  important fresh evidence is a two edged thing  and may possibly cut in a very different direction to that which lestrade imagines  take your breakfast  watson  and we will go out together and see what we can do  i feel as if i shall need your company and your moral support today my friend had no breakfast himself  for it was one of his peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit himself no food  and i have known him presume upon his iron strength until he has fainted from pure inanition  at present i cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion  he would say in answer to my medical remonstrances  i was not surprised  therefore  when this morning he left his untouched meal behind him  and started with me for norwood  a crowd of morbid sightseers were still gathered round deep dene house  which was just such a suburban villa as i had pictured  within the gates lestrade met us  his face flushed with victory  his manner grossly triumphant well  mr  holmes  have you proved us to be wrong yet  have you found your tramp  he cried i have formed no conclusion whatever  my companion answered but we formed ours yesterday  and now it proves to be correct  so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of you this time mr  holmes you certainly have the air of something unusual having occurred  said holmes lestrade laughed loudly you don t like being beaten any more than the rest of us do  said he a man can t expect always to have it his own way  can he  dr  watson step this way  if you please  gentlemen  and i think i can convince you once for all that it was john mcfarlane who did this crime he led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond this is where young mcfarlane must have come out to get his hat after the crime was done  said he  now look at this  with dramatic suddenness he struck a match  and by its light exposed a stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall  as he held the match nearer  i saw that it was more than a stain  it was the well marked print of a thumb look at that with your magnifying glass  mr  holmes yes  i am doing so you are aware that no two thumb marks are alike i have heard something of the kind well  then  will you please compare that print with this wax impression of young mcfarlane s right thumb  taken by my orders this morning as he held the waxen print close to the blood stain  it did not take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from the same thumb  it was evident to me that our unfortunate client was lost that is final  said lestrade yes  that is final  i involuntarily echoed it is final  said holmes something in his tone caught my ear  and i turned to look at him  an extraordinary change had come over his face  it was writhing with inward merriment  his two eyes were shining like stars  it seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a convulsive attack of laughter dear me  dear me  he said at last  well  now  who would have thought it  and how deceptive appearances may be  to be sure  such a nice young man to look at  it is a lesson to us not to trust our own judgment  is it not  lestrade yes  some of us are a little too much inclined to be cock sure  mr holmes  said lestrade  the man s insolence was maddening  but we could not resent it what a providential thing that this young man should press his right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg  such a very natural action  too  if you come to think of it  holmes was outwardly calm  but his whole body gave a wriggle of suppressed excitement as he spoke by the way  lestrade  who made this remarkable discovery it was the housekeeper  mrs  lexington  who drew the night constable s attention to it where was the night constable he remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was committed  so as to see that nothing was touched but why didn t the police see this mark yesterday well  we had no particular reason to make a careful examination of the hall  besides  it s not in a very prominent place  as you see no  no of course not  i suppose there is no doubt that the mark was there yesterday lestrade looked at holmes as if he thought he was going out of his mind i confess that i was myself surprised both at his hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation i don t know whether you think that mcfarlane came out of jail in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence against himself said lestrade  i leave it to any expert in the world whether that is not the mark of his thumb it is unquestionably the mark of his thumb there  that s enough  said lestrade  i am a practical man  mr holmes  and when i have got my evidence i come to my conclusions  if you have anything to say  you will find me writing my report in the sitting room holmes had recovered his equanimity  though i still seemed to detect gleams of amusement in his expression dear me  this is a very sad development  watson  is it not  said he and yet there are singular points about it which hold out some hopes for our client i am delighted to hear it  said i  heartily  i was afraid it was all up with him i would hardly go so far as to say that  my dear watson  the fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to which our friend attaches so much importance indeed  holmes  what is it only this  that i know that that mark was not there when i examined the hall yesterday  and now  watson  let us have a little stroll round in the sunshine with a confused brain  but with a heart into which some warmth of hope was returning  i accompanied my friend in a walk round the garden holmes took each face of the house in turn  and examined it with great interest  he then led the way inside  and went over the whole building from basement to attic  most of the rooms were unfurnished  but none the less holmes inspected them all minutely  finally  on the top corridor which ran outside three untenanted bedrooms  he again was seized with a spasm of merriment there are really some very unique features about this case  watson said he  i think it is time now that we took our friend lestrade into our confidence  he has had his little smile at our expense  and perhaps we may do as much by him  if my reading of this problem proves to be correct  yes  yes  i think i see how we should approach it the scotland yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when holmes interrupted him i understood that you were writing a report of this case  said he so i am don t you think it may be a little premature  i can t help thinking that your evidence is not complete lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words  he laid down his pen and looked curiously at him what do you mean  mr  holmes only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen can you produce him i think i can then do so i will do my best  how many constables have you there are three within call excellent  said holmes  may i ask if they are all large  able bodied men with powerful voices i have no doubt they are  though i fail to see what their voices have to do with it perhaps i can help you to see that and one or two other things as well  said holmes  kindly summon your men  and i will try five minutes later  three policemen had assembled in the hall in the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw  said holmes  i will ask you to carry in two bundles of it  i think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the witness whom i require thank you very much  i believe you have some matches in your pocket watson  now  mr  lestrade  i will ask you all to accompany me to the top landing as i have said  there was a broad corridor there  which ran outside three empty bedrooms  at one end of the corridor we were all marshalled by sherlock holmes  the constables grinning and lestrade staring at my friend with amazement  expectation  and derision chasing each other across his features  holmes stood before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of water put the straw on the floor here  free from the wall on either side  now i think that we are all ready lestrade s face had begun to grow red and angry  i don t know whether you are playing a game with us  mr  sherlock holmes  said he  if you know anything  you can surely say it without all this tomfoolery i assure you  my good lestrade  that i have an excellent reason for everything that i do  you may possibly remember that you chaffed me a little  some hours ago  when the sun seemed on your side of the hedge so you must not grudge me a little pomp and ceremony now  might i ask you  watson  to open that window  and then to put a match to the edge of the straw i did so  and driven by the draught a coil of gray smoke swirled down the corridor  while the dry straw crackled and flamed now we must see if we can find this witness for you  lestrade  might i ask you all to join in the cry of fire  now then  one  two three fire  we all yelled thank you  i will trouble you once again fire just once more  gentlemen  and all together fire  the shout must have rung over norwood it had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened  a door suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the end of the corridor  and a little  wizened man darted out of it  like a rabbit out of its burrow capital  said holmes  calmly  watson  a bucket of water over the straw  that will do  lestrade  allow me to present you with your principal missing witness  mr  jonas oldacre the detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement  the latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor  and peering at us and at the smouldering fire  it was an odious face crafty  vicious malignant  with shifty  light gray eyes and white lashes what s this  then  said lestrade  at last  what have you been doing all this time  eh oldacre gave an uneasy laugh  shrinking back from the furious red face of the angry detective i have done no harm no harm  you have done your best to get an innocent man hanged  if it wasn t for this gentleman here  i am not sure that you would not have succeeded the wretched creature began to whimper i am sure  sir  it was only my practical joke oh  a joke  was it  you won t find the laugh on your side  i promise you  take him down  and keep him in the sitting room until i come  mr holmes  he continued  when they had gone  i could not speak before the constables  but i don t mind saying  in the presence of dr  watson that this is the brightest thing that you have done yet  though it is a mystery to me how you did it  you have saved an innocent man s life and you have prevented a very grave scandal  which would have ruined my reputation in the force holmes smiled  and clapped lestrade upon the shoulder instead of being ruined  my good sir  you will find that your reputation has been enormously enhanced  just make a few alterations in that report which you were writing  and they will understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of inspector lestrade and you don t want your name to appear not at all  the work is its own reward  perhaps i shall get the credit also at some distant day  when i permit my zealous historian to lay out his foolscap once more eh  watson  well  now  let us see where this rat has been lurking a lath and plaster partition had been run across the passage six feet from the end  with a door cunningly concealed in it  it was lit within by slits under the eaves  a few articles of furniture and a supply of food and water were within  together with a number of books and papers there s the advantage of being a builder  said holmes  as we came out  he was able to fix up his own little hiding place without any confederate save  of course  that precious housekeeper of his  whom i should lose no time in adding to your bag  lestrade i ll take your advice  but how did you know of this place  mr  holmes i made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house  when i paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the corresponding one below  it was pretty clear where he was  i thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of fire  we could  of course  have gone in and taken him  but it amused me to make him reveal himself besides  i owed you a little mystification  lestrade  for your chaff in the morning well  sir  you certainly got equal with me on that  but how in the world did you know that he was in the house at all the thumb mark  lestrade  you said it was final  and so it was  in a very different sense  i knew it had not been there the day before  i pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail  as you may have observed and i had examined the hall  and was sure that the wall was clear therefore  it had been put on during the night but how very simply  when those packets were sealed up  jonas oldacre got mcfarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb upon the soft wax  it would be done so quickly and so naturally  that i daresay the young man himself has no recollection of it  very likely it just so happened  and oldacre had himself no notion of the use he would put it to  brooding over the case in that den of his  it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning evidence he could make against mcfarlane by using that thumb mark  it was the simplest thing in the world for him to take a wax impression from the seal  to moisten it in as much blood as he could get from a pin prick  and to put the mark upon the wall during the night  either with his own hand or with that of his housekeeper if you examine among those documents which he took with him into his retreat  i will lay you a wager that you find the seal with the thumb mark upon it wonderful  said lestrade  wonderful  it s all as clear as crystal  as you put it  but what is the object of this deep deception  mr  holmes it was amusing to me to see how the detective s overbearing manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions of its teacher well  i don t think that is very hard to explain  a very deep malicious  vindictive person is the gentleman who is now waiting us downstairs  you know that he was once refused by mcfarlane s mother you don t  i told you that you should go to blackheath first and norwood afterwards  well  this injury  as he would consider it  has rankled in his wicked  scheming brain  and all his life he has longed for vengeance  but never seen his chance  during the last year or two things have gone against him secret speculation  i think and he finds himself in a bad way  he determines to swindle his creditors  and for this purpose he pays large checks to a certain mr  cornelius  who is  i imagine  himself under another name  i have not traced these checks yet  but i have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some provincial town where oldacre from time to time led a double existence he intended to change his name altogether  draw this money  and vanish starting life again elsewhere well  that s likely enough it would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all pursuit off his track  and at the same time have an ample and crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart  if he could give the impression that he had been murdered by her only child  it was a masterpiece of villainy  and he carried it out like a master  the idea of the will  which would give an obvious motive for the crime  the secret visit unknown to his own parents  the retention of the stick  the blood  and the animal remains and buttons in the wood pile  all were admirable  it was a net from which it seemed to me  a few hours ago  that there was no possible escape  but he had not that supreme gift of the artist  the knowledge of when to stop  he wished to improve that which was already perfect to draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his unfortunate victim and so he ruined all  let us descend  lestrade  there are just one or two questions that i would ask him the malignant creature was seated in his own parlour  with a policeman upon each side of him it was a joke  my good sir a practical joke  nothing more  he whined incessantly  i assure you  sir  that i simply concealed myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance  and i am sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that i would have allowed any harm to befall poor young mr  mcfarlane that s for a jury to decide  said lestrade  anyhow  we shall have you on a charge of conspiracy  if not for attempted murder and you ll probably find that your creditors will impound the banking account of mr  cornelius  said holmes the little man started  and turned his malignant eyes upon my friend i have to thank you for a good deal  said he  perhaps i ll pay my debt some day holmes smiled indulgently i fancy that  for some few years  you will find your time very fully occupied  said he  by the way  what was it you put into the wood pile besides your old trousers  a dead dog  or rabbits  or what  you won t tell  dear me  how very unkind of you  well  well  i daresay that a couple of rabbits would account both for the blood and for the charred ashes  if ever you write an account  watson  you can make rabbits serve your turn the adventure of the dancing men holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a particularly malodorous product  his head was sunk upon his breast  and he looked from my point of view like a strange  lank bird  with dull gray plumage and a black top knot so  watson  said he  suddenly  you do not propose to invest in south african securities i gave a start of astonishment  accustomed as i was to holmes s curious faculties  this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was utterly inexplicable how on earth do you know that  i asked he wheeled round upon his stool  with a steaming test tube in his hand and a gleam of amusement in his deep set eyes now  watson  confess yourself utterly taken aback  said he i am i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect why because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly simple i am sure that i shall say nothing of the kind you see  my dear watson he propped his test tube in the rack  and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences  each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself  if  after doing so  one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents one s audience with the starting point and the conclusion  one may produce a startling  though possibly a meretricious  effect  now  it was not really difficult  by an inspection of the groove between your left forefinger and thumb  to feel sure that you did not propose to invest your small capital in the gold fields i see no connection very likely not  but i can quickly show you a close connection  here are the missing links of the very simple chain   you had chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night  you put chalk there when you play billiards  to steady the cue  you never play billiards except with thurston   you told me  four weeks ago  that thurston had an option on some south african property which would expire in a month  and which he desired you to share with him   your check book is locked in my drawer  and you have not asked for the key   you do not propose to invest your money in this manner how absurdly simple  i cried quite so  said he  a little nettled  every problem becomes very childish when once it is explained to you  here is an unexplained one see what you can make of that  friend watson  he tossed a sheet of paper upon the table  and turned once more to his chemical analysis i looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper why  holmes  it is a child s drawing  i cried oh  that s your idea what else should it be that is what mr  hilton cubitt  of riding thorpe manor  norfolk  is very anxious to know  this little conundrum came by the first post  and he was to follow by the next train  there s a ring at the bell  watson i should not be very much surprised if this were he a heavy step was heard upon the stairs  and an instant later there entered a tall  ruddy  clean shaven gentleman  whose clear eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of baker street  he seemed to bring a whiff of his strong  fresh  bracing  east coast air with him as he entered  having shaken hands with each of us  he was about to sit down  when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious markings  which i had just examined and left upon the table well  mr  holmes  what do you make of these  he cried  they told me that you were fond of queer mysteries  and i don t think you can find a queerer one than that  i sent the paper on ahead  so that you might have time to study it before i came it is certainly rather a curious production  said holmes  at first sight it would appear to be some childish prank  it consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they are drawn  why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an object i never should  mr  holmes  but my wife does  it is frightening her to death  she says nothing  but i can see terror in her eyes  that s why i want to sift the matter to the bottom holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it  it was a page torn from a notebook  the markings were done in pencil  and ran in this way graphic holmes examined it for some time  and then  folding it carefully up  he placed it in his pocketbook this promises to be a most interesting and unusual case  said he you gave me a few particulars in your letter  mr  hilton cubitt  but i should be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for the benefit of my friend  dr  watson i m not much of a story teller  said our visitor  nervously clasping and unclasping his great  strong hands  you ll just ask me anything that i don t make clear  i ll begin at the time of my marriage last year  but i want to say first of all that  though i m not a rich man my people have been at riding thorpe for a matter of five centuries  and there is no better known family in the county of norfolk  last year i came up to london for the jubilee  and i stopped at a boarding house in russell square  because parker  the vicar of our parish  was staying in it  there was an american young lady there patrick was the name elsie patrick  in some way we became friends  until before my month was up i was as much in love as man could be  we were quietly married at a registry office  and we returned to norfolk a wedded couple  you ll think it very mad  mr  holmes  that a man of a good old family should marry a wife in this fashion  knowing nothing of her past or of her people  but if you saw her and knew her  it would help you to understand she was very straight about it  was elsie  i can t say that she did not give me every chance of getting out of it if i wished to do so  i have had some very disagreeable associations in my life  said she  i wish to forget all about them  i would rather never allude to the past  for it is very painful to me  if you take me  hilton  you will take a woman who has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of  but you will have to be content with my word for it  and to allow me to be silent as to all that passed up to the time when i became yours  if these conditions are too hard  then go back to norfolk  and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me  it was only the day before our wedding that she said those very words to me  i told her that i was content to take her on her own terms  and i have been as good as my word well we have been married now for a year  and very happy we have been but about a month ago  at the end of june  i saw for the first time signs of trouble  one day my wife received a letter from america  i saw the american stamp  she turned deadly white  read the letter  and threw it into the fire  she made no allusion to it afterwards  and i made none  for a promise is a promise  but she has never known an easy hour from that moment  there is always a look of fear upon her face a look as if she were waiting and expecting  she would do better to trust me she would find that i was her best friend  but until she speaks  i can say nothing  mind you  she is a truthful woman  mr  holmes  and whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of hers  i am only a simple norfolk squire  but there is not a man in england who ranks his family honour more highly than i do  she knows it well  and she knew it well before she married me  she would never bring any stain upon it of that i am sure well  now i come to the queer part of my story  about a week ago it was the tuesday of last week i found on one of the window sills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these upon the paper  they were scrawled with chalk  i thought that it was the stable boy who had drawn them  but the lad swore he knew nothing about it  anyhow  they had come there during the night  i had them washed out  and i only mentioned the matter to my wife afterwards  to my surprise  she took it very seriously  and begged me if any more came to let her see them  none did come for a week  and then yesterday morning i found this paper lying on the sundial in the garden  i showed it to elsie  and down she dropped in a dead faint  since then she has looked like a woman in a dream  half dazed  and with terror always lurking in her eyes  it was then that i wrote and sent the paper to you  mr  holmes  it was not a thing that i could take to the police  for they would have laughed at me  but you will tell me what to do  i am not a rich man  but if there is any danger threatening my little woman  i would spend my last copper to shield her he was a fine creature  this man of the old english soil simple straight  and gentle  with his great  earnest blue eyes and broad comely face  his love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his features  holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention and now he sat for some time in silent thought don t you think  mr  cubitt  said he  at last  that your best plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife  and to ask her to share her secret with you hilton cubitt shook his massive head a promise is a promise  mr  holmes  if elsie wished to tell me she would  if not  it is not for me to force her confidence  but i am justified in taking my own line and i will then i will help you with all my heart  in the first place  have you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood no i presume that it is a very quiet place  any fresh face would cause comment in the immediate neighbourhood  yes  but we have several small watering places not very far away  and the farmers take in lodgers these hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning  if it is a purely arbitrary one  it may be impossible for us to solve it  if  on the other hand  it is systematic  i have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom of it  but this particular sample is so short that i can do nothing  and the facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation  i would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen lookout  and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men which may appear  it is a thousand pities that we have not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the window sill  make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the neighbourhood  when you have collected some fresh evidence  come to me again  that is the best advice which i can give you  mr  hilton cubitt if there are any pressing fresh developments  i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk home the interview left sherlock holmes very thoughtful  and several times in the next few days i saw him take his slip of paper from his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it  he made no allusion to the affair  however  until one afternoon a fortnight or so later  i was going out when he called me back you had better stay here  watson why because i had a wire from hilton cubitt this morning  you remember hilton cubitt  of the dancing men  he was to reach liverpool street at one twenty  he may be here at any moment  i gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of importance we had not long to wait  for our norfolk squire came straight from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him  he was looking worried and depressed  with tired eyes and a lined forehead it s getting on my nerves  this business  mr  holmes  said he  as he sank  like a wearied man  into an armchair  it s bad enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen  unknown folk  who have some kind of design upon you  but when  in addition to that  you know that it is just killing your wife by inches  then it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure  she s wearing away under it just wearing away before my eyes has she said anything yet no  mr  holmes  she has not  and yet there have been times when the poor girl has wanted to speak  and yet could not quite bring herself to take the plunge  i have tried to help her  but i daresay i did it clumsily  and scared her from it  she has spoken about my old family and our reputation in the county  and our pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it was leading to the point  but somehow it turned off before we got there but you have found out something for yourself a good deal  mr  holmes  i have several fresh dancing men pictures for you to examine  and  what is more important  i have seen the fellow what  the man who draws them yes  i saw him at his work  but i will tell you everything in order when i got back after my visit to you  the very first thing i saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men  they had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the tool house  which stands beside the lawn in full view of the front windows  i took an exact copy  and here it is  he unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table  here is a copy of the hieroglyphics graphic excellent  said holmes  excellent  pray continue when i had taken the copy  i rubbed out the marks  but  two mornings later  a fresh inscription had appeared  i have a copy of it here graphic holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight our material is rapidly accumulating  said he three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper  and placed under a pebble upon the sundial  here it is  the characters are  as you see  exactly the same as the last one  after that i determined to lie in wait  so i got out my revolver and i sat up in my study  which overlooks the lawn and garden  about two in the morning i was seated by the window  all being dark save for the moonlight outside  when i heard steps behind me  and there was my wife in her dressing gown  she implored me to come to bed  i told her frankly that i wished to see who it was who played such absurd tricks upon us  she answered that it was some senseless practical joke  and that i should not take any notice of it if it really annoys you  hilton  we might go and travel  you and i and so avoid this nuisance what  be driven out of our own house by a practical joker  said i why  we should have the whole county laughing at us well  come to bed  said she  and we can discuss it in the morning suddenly  as she spoke  i saw her white face grow whiter yet in the moonlight  and her hand tightened upon my shoulder  something was moving in the shadow of the tool house  i saw a dark  creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door  seizing my pistol  i was rushing out  when my wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive strength  i tried to throw her off  but she clung to me most desperately  at last i got clear  but by the time i had opened the door and reached the house the creature was gone  he had left a trace of his presence  however  for there on the door was the very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared  and which i have copied on that paper  there was no other sign of the fellow anywhere  though i ran all over the grounds  and yet the amazing thing is that he must have been there all the time  for when i examined the door again in the morning  he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line which i had already seen have you that fresh drawing yes  it is very short  but i made a copy of it  and here it is again he produced a paper  the new dance was in this form graphic tell me  said holmes and i could see by his eyes that he was much excited was this a mere addition to the first or did it appear to be entirely separate it was on a different panel of the door excellent  this is far the most important of all for our purpose  it fills me with hopes  now  mr  hilton cubitt  please continue your most interesting statement i have nothing more to say  mr  holmes  except that i was angry with my wife that night for having held me back when i might have caught the skulking rascal  she said that she feared that i might come to harm  for an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared was that he might come to harm  for i could not doubt that she knew who this man was  and what he meant by these strange signals  but there is a tone in my wife s voice  mr  holmes  and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt  and i am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind  there s the whole case  and now i want your advice as to what i ought to do  my own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery  and when this fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future i fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies  said holmes how long can you stay in london i must go back to day  i would not leave my wife alone all night for anything  she is very nervous  and begged me to come back i daresay you are right  but if you could have stopped  i might possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two  meanwhile you will leave me these papers  and i think that it is very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon your case sherlock holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor had left us  although it was easy for me  who knew him so well  to see that he was profoundly excited  the moment that hilton cubitt s broad back had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table laid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him and threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation  for two hours i watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and letters  so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently forgotten my presence  sometimes he was making progress and whistled and sang at his work  sometimes he was puzzled  and would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye  finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction  and walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together  then he wrote a long telegram upon a cable form  if my answer to this is as i hope  you will have a very pretty case to add to your collection  watson  said he  i expect that we shall be able to go down to norfolk tomorrow  and to take our friend some very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance i confess that i was filled with curiosity  but i was aware that holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way  so i waited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence but there was a delay in that answering telegram  and two days of impatience followed  during which holmes pricked up his ears at every ring of the bell  on the evening of the second there came a letter from hilton cubitt  all was quiet with him  save that a long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sundial  he inclosed a copy of it  which is here reproduced graphic holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes  and then suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay his face was haggard with anxiety we have let this affair go far enough  said he  is there a train to north walsham to night i turned up the time table  the last had just gone then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning said holmes  our presence is most urgently needed  ah  here is our expected cablegram  one moment  mrs  hudson  there may be an answer  no that is quite as i expected  this message makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in letting hilton cubitt know how matters stand  for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire is entangled so  indeed  it proved  and as i come to the dark conclusion of a story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre  i experience once again the dismay and horror with which i was filled  would that i had some brighter ending to communicate to my readers  but these are the chronicles of fact  and i must follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for some days made riding thorpe manor a household word through the length and breadth of england we had hardly alighted at north walsham  and mentioned the name of our destination  when the station master hurried towards us  i suppose that you are the detectives from london  said he a look of annoyance passed over holmes s face what makes you think such a thing because inspector martin from norwich has just passed through  but maybe you are the surgeons  she s not dead or wasn t by last accounts you may be in time to save her yet though it be for the gallows holmes s brow was dark with anxiety we are going to riding thorpe manor  said he  but we have heard nothing of what has passed there it s a terrible business  said the stationmaster  they are shot  both mr  hilton cubitt and his wife  she shot him and then herself so the servants say  he s dead and her life is despaired of  dear  dear  one of the oldest families in the county of norfolk  and one of the most honoured without a word holmes hurried to a carriage  and during the long seven miles  drive he never opened his mouth  seldom have i seen him so utterly despondent  he had been uneasy during all our journey from town  and i had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with anxious attention  but now this sudden realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy  he leaned back in his seat  lost in gloomy speculation  yet there was much around to interest us  for we were passing through as singular a countryside as any in england  where a few scattered cottages represented the population of to day  while on every hand enormous square towered churches bristled up from the flat green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old east anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appeared over the green edge of the norfolk coast  and the driver pointed with his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees  that s riding thorpe manor  said he as we drove up to the porticoed front door  i observed in front of it beside the tennis lawn  the black tool house and the pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations  a dapper little man  with a quick  alert manner and a waxed moustache  had just descended from a high dog cart  he introduced himself as inspector martin  of the norfolk constabulary  and he was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my companion why  mr  holmes  the crime was only committed at three this morning how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i i anticipated it  i came in the hope of preventing it then you must have important evidence  of which we are ignorant  for they were said to be a most united couple i have only the evidence of the dancing men  said holmes  i will explain the matter to you later  meanwhile  since it is too late to prevent this tragedy  i am very anxious that i should use the knowledge which i possess in order to insure that justice be done  will you associate me in your investigation  or will you prefer that i should act independently i should be proud to feel that we were acting together  mr  holmes said the inspector  earnestly in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay inspector martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things in his own fashion  and contented himself with carefully noting the results  the local surgeon  an old  white haired man  had just come down from mrs  hilton cubitt s room  and he reported that her injuries were serious  but not necessarily fatal  the bullet had passed through the front of her brain  and it would probably be some time before she could regain consciousness  on the question of whether she had been shot or had shot herself  he would not venture to express any decided opinion certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters  there was only the one pistol found in the room  two barrels of which had been emptied  mr  hilton cubitt had been shot through the heart  it was equally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself  or that she had been the criminal  for the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them has he been moved  asked holmes we have moved nothing except the lady  we could not leave her lying wounded upon the floor how long have you been here  doctor since four o clock anyone else yes  the constable here and you have touched nothing nothing you have acted with great discretion  who sent for you the housemaid  saunders was it she who gave the alarm she and mrs  king  the cook where are they now in the kitchen  i believe then i think we had better hear their story at once the old hall  oak panelled and high windowed  had been turned into a court of investigation  holmes sat in a great  old fashioned chair  his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face  i could read in them a set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save should at last be avenged  the trim inspector martin the old  gray headed country doctor  myself  and a stolid village policeman made up the rest of that strange company the two women told their story clearly enough  they had been aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion  which had been followed a minute later by a second one  they slept in adjoining rooms  and mrs king had rushed in to saunders  together they had descended the stairs the door of the study was open  and a candle was burning upon the table their master lay upon his face in the centre of the room  he was quite dead  near the window his wife was crouching  her head leaning against the wall  she was horribly wounded  and the side of her face was red with blood  she breathed heavily  but was incapable of saying anything the passage  as well as the room  was full of smoke and the smell of powder  the window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside  both women were positive upon the point  they had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable  then  with the aid of the groom and the stable boy  they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room  both she and her husband had occupied the bed  she was clad in her dress he in his dressing gown  over his night clothes  nothing had been moved in the study  so far as they knew  there had never been any quarrel between husband and wife  they had always looked upon them as a very united couple these were the main points of the servants  evidence  in answer to inspector martin  they were clear that every door was fastened upon the inside  and that no one could have escaped from the house  in answer to holmes  they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the top floor  i commend that fact very carefully to your attention  said holmes to his professional colleague  and now i think that we are in a position to undertake a thorough examination of the room the study proved to be a small chamber  lined on three sides with books and with a writing table facing an ordinary window  which looked out upon the garden  our first attention was given to the body of the unfortunate squire  whose huge frame lay stretched across the room  his disordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep the bullet had been fired at him from the front  and had remained in his body  after penetrating the heart  his death had certainly been instantaneous and painless  there was no powder marking either upon his dressing gown or on his hands  according to the country surgeon  the lady had stains upon her face  but none upon her hand the absence of the latter means nothing  though its presence may mean everything  said holmes  unless the powder from a badly fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward  one may fire many shots without leaving a sign  i would suggest that mr  cubitt s body may now be removed  i suppose  doctor  you have not recovered the bullet which wounded the lady a serious operation will be necessary before that can be done  but there are still four cartridges in the revolver  two have been fired and two wounds inflicted  so that each bullet can be accounted for so it would seem  said holmes  perhaps you can account also for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window he had turned suddenly  and his long  thin finger was pointing to a hole which had been drilled right through the lower window sash  about an inch above the bottom by george  cried the inspector  how ever did you see that because i looked for it wonderful  said the country doctor  you are certainly right  sir then a third shot has been fired  and therefore a third person must have been present  but who could that have been  and how could he have got away that is the problem which we are now about to solve  said sherlock holmes  you remember  inspector martin  when the servants said that on leaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder  i remarked that the point was an extremely important one yes  sir  but i confess i did not quite follow you it suggested that at the time of the firing  the window as well as the door of the room had been open  otherwise the fumes of powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house  a draught in the room was necessary for that  both door and window were only open for a very short time  however how do you prove that because the candle was not guttered capital  cried the inspector  capital feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy i conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair  who stood outside this opening and fired through it  any shot directed at this person might hit the sash  i looked  and there  sure enough  was the bullet mark but how came the window to be shut and fastened the woman s first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window  but halloa  what is this it was a lady s hand bag which stood upon the study table a trim little handbag of crocodile skin and silver  holmes opened it and turned the contents out  there were twenty fifty pound notes of the bank of england  held together by an india rubber band nothing else this must be preserved  for it will figure in the trial  said holmes as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector  it is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet which has clearly  from the splintering of the wood  been fired from inside the room  i should like to see mrs  king  the cook  again  you said  mrs  king  that you were awakened by a loud explosion  when you said that  did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one well  sir  it wakened me from my sleep  so it is hard to judge  but it did seem very loud you don t think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the same instant i am sure i couldn t say  sir i believe that it was undoubtedly so  i rather think  inspector martin that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us  if you will kindly step round with me  we shall see what fresh evidence the garden has to offer a flower bed extended up to the study window  and we all broke into an exclamation as we approached it  the flowers were trampled down  and the soft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks  large  masculine feet they were  with peculiarly long  sharp toes  holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird  then  with a cry of satisfaction  he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder i thought so  said he  the revolver had an ejector  and here is the third cartridge  i really think  inspector martin  that our case is almost complete the country inspector s face had shown his intense amazement at the rapid and masterful progress of holmes s investigation  at first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position  but now he was overcome with admiration  and ready to follow without question wherever holmes led whom do you suspect  he asked i ll go into that later  there are several points in this problem which i have not been able to explain to you yet  now that i have got so far i had best proceed on my own lines  and then clear the whole matter up once and for all just as you wish  mr  holmes  so long as we get our man i have no desire to make mysteries  but it is impossible at the moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations  i have the threads of this affair all in my hand  even if this lady should never recover consciousness  we can still reconstruct the events of last night and insure that justice be done  first of all  i wish to know whether there is any inn in this neighbourhood known as elrige s the servants were cross questioned  but none of them had heard of such a place  the stable boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off  in the direction of east ruston is it a lonely farm very lonely  sir perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the night maybe not  sir holmes thought for a little  and then a curious smile played over his face saddle a horse  my lad  said he  i shall wish you to take a note to elrige s farm he took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men  with these in front of him  he worked for some time at the study table  finally he handed a note to the boy  with directions to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed  and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be put to him  i saw the outside of the note  addressed in straggling  irregular characters  very unlike holmes s usual precise hand  it was consigned to mr  abe slaney  elriges farm  east ruston  norfolk i think  inspector  holmes remarked  that you would do well to telegraph for an escort  as  if my calculations prove to be correct  you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county jail the boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram  if there is an afternoon train to town  watson  i think we should do well to take it  as i have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish and this investigation draws rapidly to a close when the youth had been dispatched with the note  sherlock holmes gave his instructions to the servants  if any visitor were to call asking for mrs  hilton cubitt  no information should be given as to her condition but he was to be shown at once into the drawing room  he impressed these points upon them with the utmost earnestness  finally he led the way into the drawing room  with the remark that the business was now out of our hands  and that we must while away the time as best we might until we could see what was in store for us  the doctor had departed to his patients  and only the inspector and myself remained i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and profitable manner  said holmes  drawing his chair up to the table and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were recorded the antics of the dancing men  as to you  friend watson  i owe you every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied  to you  inspector  the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable professional study  i must tell you  first of all  the interesting circumstances connected with the previous consultations which mr  hilton cubitt has had with me in baker street  he then shortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded  i have here in front of me these singular productions  at which one might smile  had they not proved themselves to be the forerunners of so terrible a tragedy  i am fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings  and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject  in which i analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers but i confess that this is entirely new to me  the object of those who invented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters convey a message  and to give the idea that they are the mere random sketches of children having once recognized  however  that the symbols stood for letters and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret writings  the solution was easy enough  the first message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say with some confidence  that the symbol xxx stood for e  as you are aware e is the most common letter in the english alphabet  and it predominates to so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most often  out of fifteen symbols in the first message  four were the same  so it was reasonable to set this down as e  it is true that in some cases the figure was bearing a flag  and in some cases not but it was probable  from the way in which the flags were distributed that they were used to break the sentence up into words  i accepted this as a hypothesis  and noted that e was represented by xxx but now came the real difficulty of the inquiry  the order of the english letters after e is by no means well marked  and any preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be reversed in a single short sentence  speaking roughly  t  a  o  i  n  s h  r  d  and l are the numerical order in which letters occur  but t a  o  and i are very nearly abreast of each other  and it would be an endless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at i therefore waited for fresh material  in my second interview with mr hilton cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one message  which appeared since there was no flag to be a single word here are the symbols  now  in the single word i have already got the two e s coming second and fourth in a word of five letters  it might be sever  or lever  or never  there can be no question that the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable  and the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady accepting it as correct  we are now able to say that the symbols stand respectively for n  v  and r even now i was in considerable difficulty  but a happy thought put me in possession of several other letters  it occurred to me that if these appeals came  as i expected  from someone who had been intimate with the lady in her early life  a combination which contained two e s with three letters between might very well stand for the name elsie  on examination i found that such a combination formed the termination of the message which was three times repeated  it was certainly some appeal to elsie  in this way i had got my l  s  and i  but what appeal could it be  there were only four letters in the word which preceded elsie and it ended in e  surely the word must be come  i tried all other four letters ending in e  but could find none to fit the case  so now i was in possession of c  o  and m  and i was in a position to attack the first message once more  dividing it into words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown  so treated  it worked out in this fashion m ere e sl ne now the first letter can only be a  which is a most useful discovery since it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence  and the h is also apparent in the second word  now it becomes am here a e slane or  filling in the obvious vacancies in the name am here abe slaney i had so many letters now that i could proceed with considerable confidence to the second message  which worked out in this fashion a  elri  es here i could only make sense by putting t and g for the missing letters and supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the writer was staying inspector martin and i had listened with the utmost interest to the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties what did you do then  sir  asked the inspector i had every reason to suppose that this abe slaney was an american since abe is an american contraction  and since a letter from america had been the starting point of all the trouble  i had also every cause to think that there was some criminal secret in the matter  the lady s allusions to her past  and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence  both pointed in that direction  i therefore cabled to my friend  wilson hargreave  of the new york police bureau  who has more than once made use of my knowledge of london crime  i asked him whether the name of abe slaney was known to him  here is his reply  the most dangerous crook in chicago  on the very evening upon which i had his answer  hilton cubitt sent me the last message from slaney  working with known letters  it took this form elsie re are to meet thy go the addition of a p and a d completed a message which showed me that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats  and my knowledge of the crooks of chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly put his words into action  i at once came to norfolk with my friend and colleague  dr  watson  but  unhappily  only in time to find that the worst had already occurred it is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case said the inspector  warmly  you will excuse me  however  if i speak frankly to you  you are only answerable to yourself  but i have to answer to my superiors  if this abe slaney  living at elrige s  is indeed the murderer  and if he has made his escape while i am seated here  i should certainly get into serious trouble you need not be uneasy  he will not try to escape how do you know to fly would be a confession of guilt then let us go arrest him i expect him here every instant but why should he come because i have written and asked him but this is incredible  mr  holmes  why should he come because you have asked him  would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and cause him to fly i think i have known how to frame the letter  said sherlock holmes in fact  if i am not very much mistaken  here is the gentleman himself coming up the drive a man was striding up the path which led to the door  he was a tall handsome  swarthy fellow  clad in a suit of gray flannel  with a panama hat  a bristling black beard  and a great  aggressive hooked nose  and flourishing a cane as he walked  he swaggered up a path as if as if the place belonged to him  and we heard his loud  confident peal at the bell i think  gentlemen  said holmes  quietly  that we had best take up our position behind the door  every precaution is necessary when dealing with such a fellow  you will need your handcuffs  inspector  you can leave the talking to me we waited in silence for a minute one of those minutes which one can never forget  then the door opened and the man stepped in  in an instant holmes clapped a pistol to his head  and martin slipped the handcuffs over his wrists  it was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he was attacked  he glared from one to the other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes  then he burst into a bitter laugh well  gentlemen  you have the drop on me this time  i seem to have knocked up against something hard  but i came here in answer to a letter from mrs  hilton cubitt  don t tell me that she is in this  don t tell me that she helped to set a trap for me mrs  hilton cubitt was seriously injured  and is at death s door the man gave a hoarse cry of grief  which rang through the house you re crazy  he cried  fiercely  it was he that was hurt  not she who would have hurt little elsie  i may have threatened her god forgive me but i would not have touched a hair of her pretty head  take it back you  say that she is not hurt she was found badly wounded  by the side of her dead husband he sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in his manacled hands  for five minutes he was silent  then he raised his face once more  and spoke with the cold composure of despair i have nothing to hide from you  gentlemen  said he  if i shot the man he had his shot at me  and there s no murder in that  but if you think i could have hurt that woman  then you don t know either me or her  i tell you  there was never a man in this world loved a woman more than i loved her  i had a right to her  she was pledged to me years ago who was this englishman that he should come between us  i tell you that i had the first right to her  and that i was only claiming my own she broke away from your influence when she found the man that you are  said holmes  sternly  she fled from america to avoid you  and she married an honourable gentleman in england  you dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her  in order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you  whom she feared and hated  you have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and driving his wife to suicide  that is your record in this business  mr  abe slaney  and you will answer for it to the law if elsie dies  i care nothing what becomes of me  said the american he opened one of his hands  and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm  see here  mister  he cried  with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes  you re not trying to scare me over this  are you  if the lady is hurt as bad as you say  who was it that wrote this note  he tossed it forward on to the table i wrote it  to bring you here you wrote it  there was no one on earth outside the joint who knew the secret of the dancing men  how came you to write it what one man can invent another can discover  said holmes  there is a cab coming to convey you to norwich  mr  slaney  but meanwhile  you have time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought  are you aware that mrs  hilton cubitt has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her husband  and that it was only my presence here  and the knowledge which i happened to possess  which has saved her from the accusation  the least that you owe her is to make it clear to the whole world that she was in no way  directly or indirectly  responsible for his tragic end i ask nothing better  said the american  i guess the very best case i can make for myself is the absolute naked truth it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you  cried the inspector  with the magnificent fair play of the british criminal law slaney shrugged his shoulders i ll chance that  said he  first of all  i want you gentlemen to understand that i have known this lady since she was a child  there were seven of us in a gang in chicago  and elsie s father was the boss of the joint  he was a clever man  was old patrick  it was he who invented that writing  which would pass as a child s scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it  well  elsie learned some of our ways  but she couldn t stand the business  and she had a bit of honest money of her own  so she gave us all the slip and got away to london  she had been engaged to me  and she would have married me  i believe  if i had taken over another profession  but she would have nothing to do with anything on the cross  it was only after her marriage to this englishman that i was able to find out where she was  i wrote to her  but got no answer after that i came over  and  as letters were no use  i put my messages where she could read them well  i have been here a month now  i lived in that farm  where i had a room down below  and could get in and out every night  and no one the wiser  i tried all i could to coax elsie away  i knew that she read the messages  for once she wrote an answer under one of them  then my temper got the better of me  and i began to threaten her  she sent me a letter then  imploring me to go away  and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal should come upon her husband  she said that she would come down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning  and speak with me through the end window  if i would go away afterwards and leave her in peace  she came down and brought money with her  trying to bribe me to go  this made me mad  and i caught her arm and tried to pull her through the window  at that moment in rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand  elsie had sunk down upon the floor  and we were face to face  i was heeled also  and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away  he fired and missed me  i pulled off almost at the same instant  and down he dropped  i made away across the garden  and as i went i heard the window shut behind me  that s god s truth  gentlemen every word of it  and i heard no more about it until that lad came riding up with a note which made me walk in here  like a jay  and give myself into your hands a cab had driven up whilst the american had been talking  two uniformed policemen sat inside  inspector martin rose and touched his prisoner on the shoulder it is time for us to go can i see her first no  she is not conscious  mr  sherlock holmes  i only hope that if ever again i have an important case  i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side we stood at the window and watched the cab drive away  as i turned back my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the table  it was the note with which holmes had decoyed him see if you can read it  watson  said he  with a smile it contained no word  but this little line of dancing men graphic if you use the code which i have explained  said holmes  you will find that it simply means come here at once  i was convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse  since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but the lady  and so  my dear watson  we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of evil  and i think that i have fulfilled my promise of giving you something unusual for your notebook  three forty is our train  and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner only one word of epilogue  the american  abe slaney  was condemned to death at the winter assizes at norwich  but his penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances  and the certainty that hilton cubitt had fired the first shot  of mrs  hilton cubitt i only know that i have heard she recovered entirely  and that she still remains a widow  devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the administration of her husband s estate the adventure of the solitary cyclist from the years  to  inclusive  mr  sherlock holmes was a very busy man  it is safe to say that there was no public case of any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight years  and there were hundreds of private cases  some of them of the most intricate and extraordinary character  in which he played a prominent part  many startling successes and a few unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of continuous work  as i have preserved very full notes of all these cases  and was myself personally engaged in many of them it may be imagined that it is no easy task to know which i should select to lay before the public  i shall  however  preserve my former rule  and give the preference to those cases which derive their interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution  for this reason i will now lay before the reader the facts connected with miss violet smith  the solitary cyclist of charlington  and the curious sequel of our investigation  which culminated in unexpected tragedy  it is true that the circumstance did not admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my friend was famous  but there were some points about the case which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which i gather the material for these little narratives on referring to my notebook for the year  i find that it was upon saturday  the rd of april  that we first heard of miss violet smith her visit was  i remember  extremely unwelcome to holmes  for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which john vincent harden  the well known tobacco millionaire  had been subjected  my friend  who loved above all things precision and concentration of thought  resented anything which distracted his attention from the matter in hand and yet  without a harshness which was foreign to his nature  it was impossible to refuse to listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman  tall  graceful  and queenly  who presented herself at baker street late in the evening  and implored his assistance and advice  it was vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied  for the young lady had come with the determination to tell her story  and it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of the room until she had done so  with a resigned air and a somewhat weary smile  holmes begged the beautiful intruder to take a seat  and to inform us what it was that was troubling her at least it cannot be your health  said he  as his keen eyes darted over her  so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy she glanced down in surprise at her own feet  and i observed the slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction of the edge of the pedal yes  i bicycle a good deal  mr  holmes  and that has something to do with my visit to you to day my friend took the lady s ungloved hand  and examined it with as close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would show to a specimen you will excuse me  i am sure  it is my business  said he  as he dropped it  i nearly fell into the error of supposing that you were typewriting  of course  it is obvious that it is music  you observe the spatulate finger ends  watson  which is common to both professions there is a spirituality about the face  however she gently turned it towards the light which the typewriter does not generate  this lady is a musician yes  mr  holmes  i teach music in the country  i presume  from your complexion yes  sir  near farnham  on the borders of surrey a beautiful neighbourhood  and full of the most interesting associations  you remember  watson  that it was near there that we took archie stamford  the forger  now  miss violet  what has happened to you near farnham  on the borders of surrey the young lady  with great clearness and composure  made the following curious statement my father is dead  mr  holmes  he was james smith  who conducted the orchestra at the old imperial theatre  my mother and i were left without a relation in the world except one uncle  ralph smith  who went to africa twenty five years ago  and we have never had a word from him since  when father died  we were left very poor  but one day we were told that there was an advertisement in the times  inquiring for our whereabouts  you can imagine how excited we were  for we thought that someone had left us a fortune  we went at once to the lawyer whose name was given in the paper  there we met two gentlemen  mr  carruthers and mr  woodley  who were home on a visit from south africa  they said that my uncle was a friend of theirs  that he had died some months before in great poverty in johannesburg  and that he had asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations  and see that they were in no want  it seemed strange to us that uncle ralph  who took no notice of us when he was alive  should be so careful to look after us when he was dead  but mr  carruthers explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the death of his brother  and so felt responsible for our fate excuse me  said holmes  when was this interview last december four months ago pray proceed mr  woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person  he was for ever making eyes at me a coarse  puffy faced  red moustached young man  with his hair plastered down on each side of his forehead  i thought that he was perfectly hateful and i was sure that cyril would not wish me to know such a person oh  cyril is his name  said holmes  smiling the young lady blushed and laughed yes  mr  holmes  cyril morton  an electrical engineer  and we hope to be married at the end of the summer  dear me  how did i get talking about him  what i wished to say was that mr  woodley was perfectly odious  but that mr  carruthers  who was a much older man  was more agreeable  he was a dark  sallow  clean shaven  silent person  but he had polite manners and a pleasant smile  he inquired how we were left and on finding that we were very poor  he suggested that i should come and teach music to his only daughter  aged ten  i said that i did not like to leave my mother  on which he suggested that i should go home to her every week end  and he offered me a hundred a year  which was certainly splendid pay  so it ended by my accepting  and i went down to chiltern grange  about six miles from farnham  mr  carruthers was a widower  but he had engaged a lady housekeeper  a very respectable elderly person  called mrs  dixon  to look after his establishment  the child was a dear  and everything promised well  mr  carruthers was very kind and very musical  and we had most pleasant evenings together  every week end i went home to my mother in town the first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the red moustached mr  woodley  he came for a visit of a week  and oh  it seemed three months to me  he was a dreadful person a bully to everyone else  but to me something infinitely worse  he made odious love to me  boasted of his wealth  said that if i married him i could have the finest diamonds in london  and finally  when i would have nothing to do with him  he seized me in his arms one day after dinner he was hideously strong and swore that he would not let me go until i had kissed him  mr  carruthers came in and tore him from me  on which he turned upon his own host  knocking him down and cutting his face open  that was the end of his visit  as you can imagine  mr  carruthers apologized to me next day  and assured me that i should never be exposed to such an insult again  i have not seen mr  woodley since and now  mr  holmes  i come at last to the special thing which has caused me to ask your advice to day  you must know that every saturday forenoon i ride on my bicycle to farnham station  in order to get the  to town  the road from chiltern grange is a lonely one  and at one spot it is particularly so  for it lies for over a mile between charlington heath upon one side and the woods which lie round charlington hall upon the other  you could not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere  and it is quite rare to meet so much as a cart  or a peasant  until you reach the high road near crooksbury hill  two weeks ago i was passing this place  when i chanced to look back over my shoulder  and about two hundred yards behind me i saw a man  also on a bicycle  he seemed to be a middle aged man  with a short  dark beard  i looked back before i reached farnham  but the man was gone  so i thought no more about it  but you can imagine how surprised i was  mr  holmes when  on my return on the monday  i saw the same man on the same stretch of road  my astonishment was increased when the incident occurred again exactly as before  on the following saturday and monday  he always kept his distance and did not molest me in any way  but still it certainly was very odd  i mentioned it to mr  carruthers  who seemed interested in what i said  and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap  so that in future i should not pass over these lonely roads without some companion the horse and trap were to have come this week  but for some reason they were not delivered  and again i had to cycle to the station that was this morning  you can think that i looked out when i came to charlington heath  and there  sure enough  was the man  exactly as he had been the two weeks before  he always kept so far from me that i could not clearly see his face  but it was certainly someone whom i did not know  he was dressed in a dark suit with a cloth cap  the only thing about his face that i could clearly see was his dark beard  to day i was not alarmed  but i was filled with curiosity  and i determined to find out who he was and what he wanted  i slowed down my machine  but he slowed down his  then i stopped altogether  but he stopped also  then i laid a trap for him  there is a sharp turning of the road  and i pedalled very quickly round this  and then i stopped and waited  i expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop  but he never appeared  then i went back and looked round the corner  i could see a mile of road  but he was not on it  to make it the more extraordinary  there was no side road at this point down which he could have gone holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands  this case certainly presents some features of its own  said he  how much time elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that the road was clear two or three minutes then he could not have retreated down the road  and you say that there are no side roads none then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other it could not have been on the side of the heath  or i should have seen him so  by the process of exclusion  we arrive at the fact that he made his way toward charlington hall  which  as i understand  is situated in its own grounds on one side of the road  anything else nothing  mr  holmes  save that i was so perplexed that i felt i should not be happy until i had seen you and had your advice holmes sat in silence for some little time where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged  he asked at last he is in the midland electrical company  at coventry he would not pay you a surprise visit oh  mr  holmes  as if i should not know him have you had any other admirers several before i knew cyril and since there was this dreadful man  woodley  if you can call him an admirer no one else our fair client seemed a little confused who was he  asked holmes oh  it may be a mere fancy of mine  but it had seemed to me sometimes that my employer  mr  carruthers  takes a great deal of interest in me we are thrown rather together  i play his accompaniments in the evening he has never said anything  he is a perfect gentleman  but a girl always knows ha  holmes looked grave  what does he do for a living he is a rich man no carriages or horses well  at least he is fairly well to do  but he goes into the city two or three times a week  he is deeply interested in south african gold shares you will let me know any fresh development  miss smith  i am very busy just now  but i will find time to make some inquiries into your case in the meantime  take no step without letting me know  good bye  and i trust that we shall have nothing but good news from you it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl should have followers  said holmes  he pulled at his meditative pipe  but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads  some secretive lover beyond all doubt  but there are curious and suggestive details about the case  watson that he should appear only at that point exactly  our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of charlington hall  then  again  how about the connection between carruthers and woodley  since they appear to be men of such a different type  how came they both to be so keen upon looking up ralph smith s relations  one more point  what sort of a menage is it which pays double the market price for a governess but does not keep a horse  although six miles from the station  odd  watson very odd you will go down no  my dear fellow  you will go down  this may be some trifling intrigue  and i cannot break my other important research for the sake of it  on monday you will arrive early at farnham  you will conceal yourself near charlington heath  you will observe these facts for yourself  and act as your own judgment advises  then  having inquired as to the occupants of the hall  you will come back to me and report  and now  watson  not another word of the matter until we have a few solid stepping stones on which we may hope to get across to our solution we had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the monday by the train which leaves waterloo at  so i started early and caught the  at farnham station i had no difficulty in being directed to charlington heath  it was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady s adventure  for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other  surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees  there was a main gateway of lichen studded stone  each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems  but besides this central carriage drive i observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them  the house was invisible from the road  but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay the heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse  gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine  behind one of these clumps i took up my position  so as to command both the gateway of the hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side  it had been deserted when i left it  but now i saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which i had come  he was clad in a dark suit  and i saw that he had a black beard  on reaching the end of the charlington grounds  he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge  disappearing from my view a quarter of an hour passed  and then a second cyclist appeared  this time it was the young lady coming from the station  i saw her look about her as she came to the charlington hedge  an instant later the man emerged from his hiding place  sprang upon his cycle  and followed her  in all the broad landscape those were the only moving figures  the graceful girl sitting very straight upon her machine  and the man behind her bending low over his handle bar with a curiously furtive suggestion in every movement  she looked back at him and slowed her pace  he slowed also  she stopped  he at once stopped  too  keeping two hundred yards behind her  her next movement was as unexpected as it was spirited  she suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed straight at him  he was as quick as she  however  and darted off in desperate flight  presently she came back up the road again  her head haughtily in the air  not deigning to take any further notice of her silent attendant  he had turned also and still kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my sight i remained in my hiding place  and it was well that i did so  for presently the man reappeared  cycling slowly back  he turned in at the hall gates  and dismounted from his machine  for some minutes i could see him standing among the trees  his hands were raised  and he seemed to be settling his necktie  then he mounted his cycle  and rode away from me down the drive towards the hall  i ran across the heath and peered through the trees  far away i could catch glimpses of the old gray building with its bristling tudor chimneys  but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery  and i saw no more of my man however  it seemed to me that i had done a fairly good morning s work and i walked back in high spirits to farnham  the local house agent could tell me nothing about charlington hall  and referred me to a well known firm in pall mall  there i halted on my way home  and met with courtesy from the representative  no  i could not have charlington hall for the summer  i was just too late  it had been let about a month ago mr  williamson was the name of the tenant  he was a respectable  elderly gentleman  the polite agent was afraid he could say no more  as the affairs of his clients were not matters which he could discuss mr  sherlock holmes listened with attention to the long report which i was able to present to him that evening  but it did not elicit that word of curt praise which i had hoped for and should have valued  on the contrary  his austere face was even more severe than usual as he commented upon the things that i had done and the things that i had not your hiding place  my dear watson  was very faulty  you should have been behind the hedge  then you would have had a close view of this interesting person  as it is  you were some hundreds of yards away and can tell me even less than miss smith  she thinks she does not know the man  i am convinced she does  why  otherwise  should he be so desperately anxious that she should not get so near him as to see his features  you describe him as bending over the handle bar  concealment again  you see  you really have done remarkably badly  he returns to the house  and you want to find out who he is  you come to a london house agent what should i have done  i cried  with some heat gone to the nearest public house  that is the centre of country gossip  they would have told you every name  from the master to the scullery maid  williamson  it conveys nothing to my mind  if he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints away from that young lady s athletic pursuit  what have we gained by your expedition the knowledge that the girl s story is true  i never doubted it  that there is a connection between the cyclist and the hall  i never doubted that either  that the hall is tenanted by williamson  who s the better for that  well  well  my dear sir  don t look so depressed  we can do little more until next saturday  and in the meantime i may make one or two inquiries myself next morning  we had a note from miss smith  recounting shortly and accurately the very incidents which i had seen  but the pith of the letter lay in the postscript i am sure that you will respect my confidence  mr  holmes  when i tell you that my place here has become difficult  owing to the fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me  i am convinced that his feelings are most deep and most honourable  at the same time  my promise is of course given  he took my refusal very seriously  but also very gently you can understand  however  that the situation is a little strained our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters  said holmes thoughtfully  as he finished the letter  the case certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility of development than i had originally thought  i should be none the worse for a quiet  peaceful day in the country  and i am inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories which i have formed holmes s quiet day in the country had a singular termination  for he arrived at baker street late in the evening  with a cut lip and a discoloured lump upon his forehead  besides a general air of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting object of a scotland yard investigation  he was immensely tickled by his own adventures and laughed heartily as he recounted them i get so little active exercise that it is always a treat  said he you are aware that i have some proficiency in the good old british sport of boxing  occasionally  it is of service  to day  for example  i should have come to very ignominious grief without it i begged him to tell me what had occurred i found that country pub which i had already recommended to your notice  and there i made my discreet inquiries  i was in the bar  and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that i wanted  williamson is a white bearded man  and he lives alone with a small staff of servants at the hall  there is some rumor that he is or has been a clergyman  but one or two incidents of his short residence at the hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical  i have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency  and they tell me that there was a man of that name in orders  whose career has been a singularly dark one  the landlord further informed me that there are usually week end visitors a warm lot  sir at the hall  and especially one gentleman with a red moustache  mr  woodley by name  who was always there  we had got as far as this  when who should walk in but the gentleman himself  who had been drinking his beer in the tap room and had heard the whole conversation who was i  what did i want  what did i mean by asking questions  he had a fine flow of language  and his adjectives were very vigorous  he ended a string of abuse by a vicious backhander  which i failed to entirely avoid  the next few minutes were delicious  it was a straight left against a slogging ruffian  i emerged as you see me  mr  woodley went home in a cart  so ended my country trip  and it must be confessed that however enjoyable  my day on the surrey border has not been much more profitable than your own the thursday brought us another letter from our client you will not be surprised  mr  holmes said she  to hear that i am leaving mr  carruthers s employment  even the high pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation  on saturday i come up to town and i do not intend to return  mr  carruthers has got a trap  and so the dangers of the lonely road  if there ever were any dangers  are now over as to the special cause of my leaving  it is not merely the strained situation with mr  carruthers  but it is the reappearance of that odious man  mr  woodley  he was always hideous  but he looks more awful than ever now  for he appears to have had an accident and he is much disfigured  i saw him out of the window  but i am glad to say i did not meet him  he had a long talk with mr  carruthers  who seemed much excited afterwards  woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood  for he did not sleep here  and yet i caught a glimpse of him again this morning  slinking about in the shrubbery  i would sooner have a savage wild animal loose about the place  i loathe and fear him more than i can say  how can mr  carruthers endure such a creature for a moment however  all my troubles will be over on saturday so i trust  watson  so i trust  said holmes  gravely  there is some deep intrigue going on round that little woman  and it is our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey  i think  watson that we must spare time to run down together on saturday morning and make sure that this curious and inclusive investigation has no untoward ending i confess that i had not up to now taken a very serious view of the case  which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre than dangerous  that a man should lie in wait for and follow a very handsome woman is no unheard of thing  and if he has so little audacity that he not only dared not address her  but even fled from her approach  he was not a very formidable assailant  the ruffian woodley was a very different person  but  except on one occasion  he had not molested our client  and now he visited the house of carruthers without intruding upon her presence  the man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those week end parties at the hall of which the publican had spoken but who he was  or what he wanted  was as obscure as ever  it was the severity of holmes s manner and the fact that he slipped a revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this curious train of events a rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning  and the heath covered countryside  with the glowing clumps of flowering gorse seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of the duns and drabs and slate grays of london  holmes and i walked along the broad sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air and rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the spring  from a rise of the road on the shoulder of crooksbury hill  we could see the grim hall bristling out from amidst the ancient oaks  which  old as they were  were still younger than the building which they surrounded  holmes pointed down the long tract of road which wound  a reddish yellow band  between the brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods  far away  a black dot  we could see a vehicle moving in our direction  holmes gave an exclamation of impatience i have given a margin of half an hour  said he  if that is her trap she must be making for the earlier train  i fear  watson  that she will be past charlington before we can possibly meet her from the instant that we passed the rise  we could no longer see the vehicle  but we hastened onward at such a pace that my sedentary life began to tell upon me  and i was compelled to fall behind  holmes however  was always in training  for he had inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw  his springy step never slowed until suddenly  when he was a hundred yards in front of me  he halted  and i saw him throw up his hand with a gesture of grief and despair  at the same instant an empty dog cart  the horse cantering  the reins trailing appeared round the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us too late  watson  too late  cried holmes  as i ran panting to his side  fool that i was not to allow for that earlier train  it s abduction  watson abduction  murder  heaven knows what  block the road stop the horse  that s right  now  jump in  and let us see if i can repair the consequences of my own blunder we had sprung into the dog cart  and holmes  after turning the horse gave it a sharp cut with the whip  and we flew back along the road  as we turned the curve  the whole stretch of road between the hall and the heath was opened up  i grasped holmes s arm that s the man  i gasped  a solitary cyclist was coming towards us his head was down and his shoulders rounded  as he put every ounce of energy that he possessed on to the pedals  he was flying like a racer suddenly he raised his bearded face  saw us close to him  and pulled up  springing from his machine  that coal black beard was in singular contrast to eyes were as bright as if he had a fever  he stared at us and at the dog cart  then a look of amazement came over his face halloa  stop there  he shouted  holding his bicycle to block our road where did you get that dog cart  pull up  man  he yelled  drawing a pistol from his side pull up  i say  or  by george  i ll put a bullet into your horse holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart you re the man we want to see  where is miss violet smith  he said  in his quick  clear way that s what i m asking you  you re in her dog cart  you ought to know where she is we met the dog cart on the road  there was no one in it  we drove back to help the young lady good lord  good lord  what shall i do  cried the stranger  in an ecstasy of despair  they ve got her  that hell hound woodley and the blackguard parson  come  man  come  if you really are her friend  stand by me and we ll save her  if i have to leave my carcass in charlington wood he ran distractedly  his pistol in his hand  towards a gap in the hedge holmes followed him  and i  leaving the horse grazing beside the road followed holmes this is where they came through  said he  pointing to the marks of several feet upon the muddy path  halloa  stop a minute  who s this in the bush it was a young fellow about seventeen  dressed like an ostler  with leather cords and gaiters  he lay upon his back  his knees drawn up  a terrible cut upon his head  he was insensible  but alive  a glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated the bone that s peter  the groom  cried the stranger  he drove her  the beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him  let him lie  we can t do him any good  but we may save her from the worst fate that can befall a woman we ran frantically down the path  which wound among the trees  we had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when holmes pulled up they didn t go to the house  here are their marks on the left here beside the laurel bushes  ah  i said so as he spoke  a woman s shrill scream a scream which vibrated with a frenzy of horror burst from the thick  green clump of bushes in front of us  it ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke and a gurgle this way  this way  they are in the bowling alley  cried the stranger  darting through the bushes  ah  the cowardly dogs  follow me gentlemen  too late  too late  by the living jingo we had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward surrounded by ancient trees  on the farther side of it  under the shadow of a mighty oak  there stood a singular group of three people  one was a woman  our client  drooping and faint  a handkerchief round her mouth  opposite her stood a brutal  heavy faced  red moustached young man  his gaitered legs parted wide  one arm akimbo  the other waving a riding crop  his whole attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado  between them an elderly gray bearded man  wearing a short surplice over a light tweed suit had evidently just completed the wedding service  for he pocketed his prayer book as we appeared  and slapped the sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation they re married  i gasped come on  cried our guide  come on  he rushed across the glade holmes and i at his heels  as we approached  the lady staggered against the trunk of the tree for support  williamson  the ex clergyman  bowed to us with mock politeness  and the bully  woodley  advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant laughter you can take your beard off  bob  said he  i know you  right enough well  you and your pals have just come in time for me to be able to introduce you to mrs  woodley our guide s answer was a singular one  he snatched off the dark beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground  disclosing a long sallow  clean shaven face below it  then he raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian  who was advancing upon him with his dangerous riding crop swinging in his hand yes  said our ally  i am bob carruthers  and i ll see this woman righted  if i have to swing for it  i told you what i d do if you molested her  and  by the lord  i ll be as good as my word you re too late  she s my wife no  she s your widow his revolver cracked  and i saw the blood spurt from the front of woodley s waistcoat  he spun round with a scream and fell upon his back his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful mottled pallor  the old man  still clad in his surplice  burst into such a string of foul oaths as i have never heard  and pulled out a revolver of his own  but before he could raise it  he was looking down the barrel of holmes s weapon enough of this  said my friend  coldly  drop that pistol  watson pick it up  hold it to his head  thank you  you  carruthers  give me that revolver  we ll have no more violence  come  hand it over who are you  then my name is sherlock holmes good lord you have heard of me  i see  i will represent the official police until their arrival  here  you  he shouted to a frightened groom  who had appeared at the edge of the glade  come here  take this note as hard as you can ride to farnham  he scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook  give it to the superintendent at the police station  until he comes  i must detain you all under my personal custody the strong  masterful personality of holmes dominated the tragic scene and all were equally puppets in his hands  williamson and carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded woodley into the house  and i gave my arm to the frightened girl  the injured man was laid on his bed  and at holmes s request i examined him  i carried my report to where he sat in the old tapestry hung dining room with his two prisoners before him he will live  said i what  cried carruthers  springing out of his chair  i ll go upstairs and finish him first  do you tell me that that angel  is to be tied to roaring jack woodley for life you need not concern yourself about that  said holmes  there are two very good reasons why she should  under no circumstances  be his wife in the first place  we are very safe in questioning mr  williamson s right to solemnize a marriage i have been ordained  cried the old rascal and also unfrocked once a clergyman  always a clergyman i think not  how about the license we had a license for the marriage  i have it here in my pocket then you got it by trick  but  in any case a forced marriage is no marriage  but it is a very serious felony  as you will discover before you have finished  you ll have time to think the point out during the next ten years or so  unless i am mistaken  as to you  carruthers  you would have done better to keep your pistol in your pocket i begin to think so  mr  holmes  but when i thought of all the precaution i had taken to shield this girl for i loved her  mr  holmes and it is the only time that ever i knew what love was it fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the greatest brute and bully in south africa a man whose name is a holy terror from kimberley to johannesburg  why  mr  holmes  you ll hardly believe it  but ever since that girl has been in my employment i never once let her go past this house  where i knew the rascals were lurking  without following her on my bicycle  just to see that she came to no harm  i kept my distance from her  and i wore a beard  so that she should not recognize me  for she is a good and high spirited girl  and she wouldn t have stayed in my employment long if she had thought that i was following her about the country roads why didn t you tell her of her danger because then  again  she would have left me  and i couldn t bear to face that  even if she couldn t love me  it was a great deal to me just to see her dainty form about the house  and to hear the sound of her voice well  said i  you call that love  mr  carruthers  but i should call it selfishness maybe the two things go together  anyhow  i couldn t let her go besides  with this crowd about  it was well that she should have someone near to look after her  then  when the cable came  i knew they were bound to make a move what cable carruthers took a telegram from his pocket that s it  said he it was short and concise the old man is dead hum  said holmes  i think i see how things worked  and i can understand how this message would  as you say  bring them to a head  but while you wait  you might tell me what you can the old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad language by heaven  said he  if you squeal on us  bob carruthers  i ll serve you as you served jack woodley  you can bleat about the girl to your heart s content  for that s your own affair  but if you round on your pals to this plain clothes copper  it will be the worst day s work that ever you did your reverence need not be excited  said holmes  lighting a cigarette the case is clear enough against you  and all i ask is a few details for my private curiosity  however  if there s any difficulty in your telling me  i ll do the talking  and then you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your secrets  in the first place  three of you came from south africa on this game you williamson  you carruthers  and woodley lie number one  said the old man  i never saw either of them until two months ago  and i have never been in africa in my life  so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it  mr  busybody holmes what he says is true  said carruthers well  well  two of you came over  his reverence is our own homemade article  you had known ralph smith in south africa  you had reason to believe he would not live long  you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune  how s that eh carruthers nodded and williamson swore she was next of kin  no doubt  and you were aware that the old fellow would make no will couldn t read or write  said carruthers so you came over  the two of you  and hunted up the girl  the idea was that one of you was to marry her  and the other have a share of the plunder  for some reason  woodley was chosen as the husband  why was that we played cards for her on the voyage  he won i see  you got the young lady into your service  and there woodley was to do the courting  she recognized the drunken brute that he was  and would have nothing to do with him  meanwhile  your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had yourself fallen in love with the lady  you could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her no  by george  i couldn t there was a quarrel between you  he left you in a rage  and began to make his own plans independently of you it strikes me  williamson  there isn t very much that we can tell this gentleman  cried carruthers  with a bitter laugh  yes  we quarreled and he knocked me down  i am level with him on that  anyhow  then i lost sight of him  that was when he picked up with this outcast padre here i found that they had set up housekeeping together at this place on the line that she had to pass for the station  i kept my eye on her after that  for i knew there was some devilry in the wind  i saw them from time to time  for i was anxious to know what they were after  two days ago woodley came up to my house with this cable  which showed that ralph smith was dead  he asked me if i would stand by the bargain  i said i would not  he asked me if i would marry the girl myself and give him a share  i said i would willingly do so  but that she would not have me he said  let us get her married first and after a week or two she may see things a bit different  i said i would have nothing to do with violence  so he went off cursing  like the foul mouthed blackguard that he was  and swearing that he would have her yet  she was leaving me this week end  and i had got a trap to take her to the station  but i was so uneasy in my mind that i followed her on my bicycle  she had got a start  however  and before i could catch her  the mischief was done the first thing i knew about it was when i saw you two gentlemen driving back in her dog cart holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate  i have been very obtuse  watson  said he  when in your report you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his necktie in the shrubbery  that alone should have told me all  however  we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and  in some respects  a unique case  i perceive three of the county constabulary in the drive  and i am glad to see that the little ostler is able to keep pace with them  so it is likely that neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently damaged by their morning s adventures  i think  watson  that in your medical capacity  you might wait upon miss smith and tell her that if she is sufficiently recovered  we shall be happy to escort her to her mother s home  if she is not quite convalescent you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a young electrician in the midlands would probably complete the cure  as to you  mr carruthers  i think that you have done what you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot  there is my card  sir  and if my evidence can be of help in your trial  it shall be at your disposal in the whirl of our incessant activity  it has often been difficult for me  as the reader has probably observed  to round off my narratives  and to give those final details which the curious might expect  each case has been the prelude to another  and the crisis once over  the actors have passed for ever out of our busy lives  i find  however  a short note at the end of my manuscript dealing with this case  in which i have put it upon record that miss violet smith did indeed inherit a large fortune  and that she is now the wife of cyril morton  the senior partner of morton  kennedy  the famous westminster electricians williamson and woodley were both tried for abduction and assault  the former getting seven years the latter ten  of the fate of carruthers i have no record  but i am sure that his assault was not viewed very gravely by the court  since woodley had the reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian  and i think that a few  months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice the adventure of the priory school we have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small stage at baker street  but i cannot recollect anything more sudden and startling than the first appearance of thorneycroft huxtable  m a  ph d  etc his card  which seemed too small to carry the weight of his academic distinctions  preceded him by a few seconds  and then he entered himself so large  so pompous  and so dignified that he was the very embodiment of self possession and solidity  and yet his first action when the door had closed behind him  was to stagger against the table whence he slipped down upon the floor  and there was that majestic figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin hearth rug we had sprung to our feet  and for a few moments we stared in silent amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage  which told of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life  then holmes hurried with a cushion for his head  and i with brandy for his lips  the heavy  white face was seamed with lines of trouble  the hanging pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in colour  the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the corners  the rolling chins were unshaven  collar and shirt bore the grime of a long journey  and the hair bristled unkempt from the well shaped head  it was a sorely stricken man who lay before us what is it  watson  asked holmes absolute exhaustion possibly mere hunger and fatigue  said i  with my finger on the thready pulse  where the stream of life trickled thin and small return ticket from mackleton  in the north of england  said holmes drawing it from the watch pocket  it is not twelve o clock yet  he has certainly been an early starter the puckered eyelids had begun to quiver  and now a pair of vacant gray eyes looked up at us  an instant later the man had scrambled on to his feet  his face crimson with shame forgive this weakness  mr  holmes  i have been a little overwrought thank you  if i might have a glass of milk and a biscuit  i have no doubt that i should be better  i came personally  mr  holmes  in order to insure that you would return with me  i feared that no telegram would convince you of the absolute urgency of the case when you are quite restored i am quite well again  i cannot imagine how i came to be so weak  i wish you  mr  holmes  to come to mackleton with me by the next train my friend shook his head my colleague  dr  watson  could tell you that we are very busy at present  i am retained in this case of the ferrers documents  and the abergavenny murder is coming up for trial  only a very important issue could call me from london at present important  our visitor threw up his hands  have you heard nothing of the abduction of the only son of the duke of holdernesse what  the late cabinet minister exactly  we had tried to keep it out of the papers  but there was some rumor in the globe last night  i thought it might have reached your ears holmes shot out his long  thin arm and picked out volume h  in his encyclopaedia of reference holdernesse  th duke  k g  p c half the alphabet  baron beverley  earl of carston dear me  what a list  lord lieutenant of hallamshire since  married edith  daughter of sir charles appledore   heir and only child  lord saltire  owns about two hundred and fifty thousand acres  minerals in lancashire and wales address  carlton house terrace  holdernesse hall  hallamshire  carston castle  bangor  wales  lord of the admiralty   chief secretary of state for  well  well  this man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the crown the greatest and perhaps the wealthiest  i am aware  mr  holmes  that you take a very high line in professional matters  and that you are prepared to work for the work s sake  i may tell you  however  that his grace has already intimated that a check for five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can tell him where his son is  and another thousand to him who can name the man or men who have taken him it is a princely offer  said holmes  watson  i think that we shall accompany dr  huxtable back to the north of england  and now  dr huxtable  when you have consumed that milk  you will kindly tell me what has happened  when it happened  how it happened  and  finally  what dr thorneycroft huxtable  of the priory school  near mackleton  has to do with the matter  and why he comes three days after an event the state of your chin gives the date to ask for my humble services our visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits  the light had come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks  as he set himself with great vigour and lucidity to explain the situation i must inform you  gentlemen  that the priory is a preparatory school of which i am the founder and principal  huxtable s sidelights on horace may possibly recall my name to your memories  the priory is  without exception  the best and most select preparatory school in england  lord leverstoke  the earl of blackwater  sir cathcart soames they all have intrusted their sons to me  but i felt that my school had reached its zenith when  weeks ago  the duke of holdernesse sent mr  james wilder his secretary  with intimation that young lord saltire  ten years old his only son and heir  was about to be committed to my charge  little did i think that this would be the prelude to the most crushing misfortune of my life on may st the boy arrived  that being the beginning of the summer term  he was a charming youth  and he soon fell into our ways  i may tell you i trust that i am not indiscreet  but half confidences are absurd in such a case that he was not entirely happy at home  it is an open secret that the duke s married life had not been a peaceful one and the matter had ended in a separation by mutual consent  the duchess taking up her residence in the south of france  this had occurred very shortly before  and the boy s sympathies are known to have been strongly with his mother  he moped after her departure from holdernesse hall and it was for this reason that the duke desired to send him to my establishment  in a fortnight the boy was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy he was last seen on the night of may th that is  the night of last monday  his room was on the second floor and was approached through another larger room  in which two boys were sleeping  these boys saw and heard nothing  so that it is certain that young saltire did not pass out that way  his window was open  and there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground  we could trace no footmarks below  but it is sure that this is the only possible exit his absence was discovered at seven o clock on tuesday morning  his bed had been slept in  he had dressed himself fully  before going off  in his usual school suit of black eton jacket and dark gray trousers  there were no signs that anyone had entered the room  and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of cries or a struggle would have been heard  since caunter  the elder boy in the inner room  is a very light sleeper when lord saltire s disappearance was discovered  i at once called a roll of the whole establishment boys  masters  and servants  it was then that we ascertained that lord saltire had not been alone in his flight  heidegger  the german master  was missing  his room was on the second floor  at the farther end of the building  facing the same way as lord saltire s  his bed had also been slept in  but he had apparently gone away partly dressed  since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor  he had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy  for we could see the marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn  his bicycle was kept in a small shed beside this lawn  and it also was gone he had been with me for two years  and came with the best references but he was a silent  morose man  not very popular either with masters or boys  no trace could be found of the fugitives  and now  on thursday morning  we are as ignorant as we were on tuesday  inquiry was  of course  made at once at holdernesse hall  it is only a few miles away and we imagined that  in some sudden attack of homesickness  he had gone back to his father  but nothing had been heard of him  the duke is greatly agitated  and  as to me  you have seen yourselves the state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the responsibility have reduced me  mr  holmes  if ever you put forward your full powers  i implore you to do so now  for never in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them sherlock holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the statement of the unhappy schoolmaster  his drawn brows and the deep furrow between them showed that he needed no exhortation to concentrate all his attention upon a problem which  apart from the tremendous interests involved must appeal so directly to his love of the complex and the unusual  he now drew out his notebook and jotted down one or two memoranda you have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner  said he severely  you start me on my investigation with a very serious handicap  it is inconceivable  for example  that this ivy and this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer i am not to blame  mr  holmes  his grace was extremely desirous to avoid all public scandal  he was afraid of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world  he has a deep horror of anything of the kind but there has been some official investigation yes  sir  and it has proved most disappointing  an apparent clue was at once obtained  since a boy and a young man were reported to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early train  only last night we had news that the couple had been hunted down in liverpool  and they prove to have no connection whatever with the matter in hand  then it was that in my despair and disappointment  after a sleepless night  i came straight to you by the early train i suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false clue was being followed up it was entirely dropped so that three days have been wasted  the affair has been most deplorably handled i feel it and admit it and yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution  i shall be very happy to look into it  have you been able to trace any connection between the missing boy and this german master none at all was he in the master s class no  he never exchanged a word with him  so far as i know that is certainly very singular  had the boy a bicycle no was any other bicycle missing no is that certain quite well  now  you do not mean to seriously suggest that this german rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night  bearing the boy in his arms certainly not then what is the theory in your mind the bicycle may have been a blind  it may have been hidden somewhere and the pair gone off on foot quite so  but it seems rather an absurd blind  does it not  were there other bicycles in this shed several would he not have hidden a couple  had he desired to give the idea that they had gone off upon them i suppose he would of course he would  the blind theory won t do  but the incident is an admirable starting point for an investigation  after all  a bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy  one other question  did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he disappeared no did he get any letters yes  one letter from whom from his father do you open the boys  letters no how do you know it was from the father the coat of arms was on the envelope  and it was addressed in the duke s peculiar stiff hand  besides  the duke remembers having written when had he a letter before that not for several days had he ever one from france no  never you see the point of my questions  of course  either the boy was carried off by force or he went of his own free will  in the latter case  you would expect that some prompting from outside would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing  if he has had no visitors  that prompting must have come in letters  hence i try to find out who were his correspondents i fear i cannot help you much  his only correspondent  so far as i know  was his own father who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance  were the relations between father and son very friendly his grace is never very friendly with anyone  he is completely immersed in large public questions  and is rather inaccessible to all ordinary emotions  but he was always kind to the boy in his own way but the sympathies of the latter were with the mother yes did he say so no the duke  then good heaven  no then how could you know i have had some confidential talks with mr  james wilder  his grace s secretary  it was he who gave me the information about lord saltire s feelings i see  by the way  that last letter of the dukes was it found in the boy s room after he was gone no  he had taken it with him  i think  mr  holmes  it is time that we were leaving for euston i will order a four wheeler  in a quarter of an hour  we shall be at your service  if you are telegraphing home  mr  huxtable  it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to imagine that the inquiry is still going on in liverpool  or wherever else that red herring led your pack  in the meantime i will do a little quiet work at your own doors  and perhaps the scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like watson and myself may get a sniff of it that evening found us in the cold  bracing atmosphere of the peak country  in which dr  huxtable s famous school is situated  it was already dark when we reached it  a card was lying on the hall table and the butler whispered something to his master  who turned to us with agitation in every heavy feature the duke is here  said he  the duke and mr  wilder are in the study come  gentlemen  and i will introduce you i was  of course  familiar with the pictures of the famous statesman but the man himself was very different from his representation  he was a tall and stately person  scrupulously dressed  with a drawn  thin face and a nose which was grotesquely curved and long  his complexion was of a dead pallor  which was more startling by contrast with a long dwindling beard of vivid red  which flowed down over his white waistcoat with his watch chain gleaming through its fringe  such was the stately presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of dr  huxtable s hearthrug  beside him stood a very young man  whom i understood to be wilder  the private secretary  he was small  nervous  alert with intelligent light blue eyes and mobile features  it was he who at once in an incisive and positive tone  opened the conversation i called this morning  dr  huxtable  too late to prevent you from starting for london  i learned that your object was to invite mr sherlock holmes to undertake the conduct of this case  his grace is surprised  dr  huxtable  that you should have taken such a step without consulting him when i learned that the police had failed his grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed but surely  mr  wilder you are well aware  dr  huxtable  that his grace is particularly anxious to avoid all public scandal  he prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence the matter can be easily remedied  said the brow beaten doctor  mr sherlock holmes can return to london by the morning train hardly that  doctor  hardly that  said holmes  in his blandest voice this northern air is invigorating and pleasant  so i propose to spend a few days upon your moors  and to occupy my mind as best i may  whether i have the shelter of your roof or of the village inn is  of course  for you to decide i could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of indecision  from which he was rescued by the deep  sonorous voice of the red bearded duke  which boomed out like a dinner gong i agree with mr  wilder  dr  huxtable  that you would have done wisely to consult me  but since mr  holmes has already been taken into your confidence  it would indeed be absurd that we should not avail ourselves of his services  far from going to the inn  mr  holmes  i should be pleased if you would come and stay with me at holdernesse hall i thank your grace  for the purposes of my investigation  i think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the mystery just as you like  mr  holmes  any information which mr  wilder or i can give you is  of course  at your disposal it will probably be necessary for me to see you at the hall  said holmes  i would only ask you now  sir  whether you have formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious disappearance of your son no sir i have not excuse me if i allude to that which is painful to you  but i have no alternative  do you think that the duchess had anything to do with the matter the great minister showed perceptible hesitation i do not think so  he said  at last the other most obvious explanation is that the child has been kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom  you have not had any demand of the sort no  sir one more question  your grace  i understand that you wrote to your son upon the day when this incident occurred no  i wrote upon the day before exactly  but he received it on that day yes was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced him or induced him to take such a step no  sir  certainly not did you post that letter yourself the nobleman s reply was interrupted by his secretary  who broke in with some heat his grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself  said he this letter was laid with others upon the study table  and i myself put them in the post bag you are sure this one was among them yes  i observed it how many letters did your grace write that day twenty or thirty  i have a large correspondence  but surely this is somewhat irrelevant not entirely  said holmes for my own part  the duke continued  i have advised the police to turn their attention to the south of france  i have already said that i do not believe that the duchess would encourage so monstrous an action but the lad had the most wrong headed opinions  and it is possible that he may have fled to her  aided and abetted by this german  i think  dr huxtable  that we will now return to the hall i could see that there were other questions which holmes would have wished to put  but the nobleman s abrupt manner showed that the interview was at an end  it was evident that to his intensely aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent  and that he feared lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history when the nobleman and his secretary had left  my friend flung himself at once with characteristic eagerness into the investigation the boy s chamber was carefully examined  and yielded nothing save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window that he could have escaped  the german master s room and effects gave no further clue in his case a trailer of ivy had given way under his weight  and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark on the lawn where his heels had come down  that one dint in the short  green grass was the only material witness left of this inexplicable nocturnal flight sherlock holmes left the house alone  and only returned after eleven he had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood  and this he brought into my room  where he laid it out on the bed  and  having balanced the lamp in the middle of it  he began to smoke over it  and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of his pipe graphic  holmes  map of the neighborhood of the school this case grows upon me  watson  said he  there are decidedly some points of interest in connection with it  in this early stage  i want you to realize those geographical features which may have a good deal to do with our investigation look at this map  this dark square is the priory school  i ll put a pin in it  now  this line is the main road  you see that it runs east and west past the school  and you see also that there is no side road for a mile either way  if these two folk passed away by road  it was this road graphic exactly by a singular and happy chance  we are able to some extent to check what passed along this road during the night in question  at this point where my pipe is now resting  a county constable was on duty from twelve to six  it is  as you perceive  the first cross road on the east side this man declares that he was not absent from his post for an instant and he is positive that neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen  i have spoken with this policeman to night and he appears to me to be a perfectly reliable person  that blocks this end  we have now to deal with the other  there is an inn here  the red bull  the landlady of which was ill  she had sent to mackleton for a doctor  but he did not arrive until morning  being absent at another case  the people at the inn were alert all night  awaiting his coming  and one or other of them seems to have continually had an eye upon the road  they declare that no one passed  if their evidence is good  then we are fortunate enough to be able to block the west  and also to be able to say that the fugitives did not use the road at all but the bicycle  i objected quite so  we will come to the bicycle presently  to continue our reasoning  if these people did not go by the road  they must have traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south of the house  that is certain  let us weigh the one against the other  on the south of the house is  as you perceive  a large district of arable land cut up into small fields  with stone walls between them  there  i admit that a bicycle is impossible  we can dismiss the idea  we turn to the country on the north  here there lies a grove of trees  marked as the ragged shaw  and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor lower gill moor  extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upward here  at one side of this wilderness  is holdernesse hall  ten miles by road  but only six across the moor  it is a peculiarly desolate plain  a few moor farmers have small holdings  where they rear sheep and cattle except these  the plover and the curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the chesterfield high road  there is a church there you see  a few cottages  and an inn  beyond that the hills become precipitous  surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie but the bicycle  i persisted well  well  said holmes  impatiently  a good cyclist does not need a high road  the moor is intersected with paths  and the moon was at the full  halloa  what is this there was an agitated knock at the door  and an instant afterwards dr huxtable was in the room  in his hand he held a blue cricket cap with a white chevron on the peak at last we have a clue  he cried  thank heaven  at last we are on the dear boy s track  it is his cap where was it found in the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor  they left on tuesday to day the police traced them down and examined their caravan  this was found how do they account for it they shuffled and lied said that they found it on the moor on tuesday morning  they know where he is  the rascals  thank goodness  they are all safe under lock and key  either the fear of the law or the duke s purse will certainly get out of them all that they know so far  so good  said holmes  when the doctor had at last left the room  it at least bears out the theory that it is on the side of the lower gill moor that we must hope for results  the police have really done nothing locally  save the arrest of these gipsies  look here watson  there is a watercourse across the moor  you see it marked here in the map  in some parts it widens into a morass  this is particularly so in the region between holdernesse hall and the school  it is vain to look elsewhere for tracks in this dry weather  but at that point there is certainly a chance of some record being left  i will call you early to morrow morning  and you and i will try if we can throw some little light upon the mystery the day was just breaking when i woke to find the long  thin form of holmes by my bedside  he was fully dressed  and had apparently already been out i have done the lawn and the bicycle shed  said he  i have also had a rumble through the ragged shaw  now  watson  there is cocoa ready in the next room  i must beg you to hurry  for we have a great day before us his eyes shone  and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration of the master workman who sees his work lie ready before him  a very different holmes  this active  alert man  from the introspective and pallid dreamer of baker street  i felt  as i looked upon that supple figure alive with nervous energy  that it was indeed a strenuous day that awaited us and yet it opened in the blackest disappointment  with high hopes we struck across the peaty  russet moor  intersected with a thousand sheep paths  until we came to the broad  light green belt which marked the morass between us and holdernesse  certainly  if the lad had gone homeward  he must have passed this  and he could not pass it without leaving his traces  but no sign of him or the german could be seen  with a darkening face my friend strode along the margin  eagerly observant of every muddy stain upon the mossy surface  sheep marks there were in profusion  and at one place  some miles down  cows had left their tracks  nothing more check number one  said holmes  looking gloomily over the rolling expanse of the moor  there is another morass down yonder  and a narrow neck between  halloa  halloa  halloa  what have we here we had come on a small black ribbon of pathway  in the middle of it clearly marked on the sodden soil  was the track of a bicycle hurrah  i cried  we have it but holmes was shaking his head  and his face was puzzled and expectant rather than joyous a bicycle  certainly  but not the bicycle  said he  i am familiar with forty two different impressions left by tires  this  as you perceive  is a dunlop  with a patch upon the outer cover  heidegger s tires were palmer s  leaving longitudinal stripes  aveling  the mathematical master  was sure upon the point  therefore  it is not heidegger s track the boy s  then possibly  if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his possession but this we have utterly failed to do  this track  as you perceive  was made by a rider who was going from the direction of the school or towards it no  no  my dear watson  the more deeply sunk impression is  of course the hind wheel  upon which the weight rests  you perceive several places where it has passed across and obliterated the more shallow mark of the front one  it was undoubtedly heading away from the school  it may or may not be connected with our inquiry  but we will follow it backwards before we go any farther we did so  and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks as we emerged from the boggy portion of the moor  following the path backwards  we picked out another spot  where a spring trickled across it  here  once again  was the mark of the bicycle  though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows  after that there was no sign  but the path ran right on into ragged shaw  the wood which backed on to the school  from this wood the cycle must have emerged  holmes sat down on a boulder and rested his chin in his hands  i had smoked two cigarettes before he moved well  well  said he  at last  it is  of course  possible that a cunning man might change the tires of his bicycle in order to leave unfamiliar tracks  a criminal who was capable of such a thought is a man whom i should be proud to do business with  we will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass again  for we have left a good deal unexplored we continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden portion of the moor  and soon our perseverance was gloriously rewarded  right across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path  holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it  an impression like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it  it was the palmer tires here is herr heidegger  sure enough  cried holmes  exultantly  my reasoning seems to have been pretty sound  watson i congratulate you but we have a long way still to go  kindly walk clear of the path  now let us follow the trail  i fear that it will not lead very far we found  however  as we advanced that this portion of the moor is intersected with soft patches  and  though we frequently lost sight of the track  we always succeeded in picking it up once more do you observe  said holmes  that the rider is now undoubtedly forcing the pace  there can be no doubt of it  look at this impression where you get both tires clear  the one is as deep as the other that can only mean that the rider is throwing his weight on to the handle bar  as a man does when he is sprinting  by jove  he has had a fall there was a broad  irregular smudge covering some yards of the track then there were a few footmarks  and the tire reappeared once more a side slip  i suggested holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse  to my horror i perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with crimson  on the path  too  and among the heather were dark stains of clotted blood bad  said holmes  bad  stand clear  watson  not an unnecessary footstep  what do i read here  he fell wounded he stood up he remounted he proceeded  but there is no other track  cattle on this side path  he was surely not gored by a bull  impossible  but i see no traces of anyone else  we must push on  watson  surely  with stains as well as the track to guide us  he cannot escape us now our search was not a very long one  the tracks of the tire began to curve fantastically upon the wet and shining path  suddenly  as i looked ahead  the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the thick gorse bushes  out of them we dragged a bicycle  palmer tired  one pedal bent  and the whole front of it horribly smeared and slobbered with blood  on the other side of the bushes a shoe was projecting  we ran round  and there lay the unfortunate rider  he was a tall man full bearded  with spectacles  one glass of which had been knocked out the cause of his death was a frightful blow upon the head  which had crushed in part of his skull  that he could have gone on after receiving such an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man  he wore shoes  but no socks  and his open coat disclosed a nightshirt beneath it  it was undoubtedly the german master holmes turned the body over reverently  and examined it with great attention  he then sat in deep thought for a time  and i could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not  in his opinion advanced us much in our inquiry it is a little difficult to know what to do  watson  said he  at last my own inclinations are to push this inquiry on  for we have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste another hour  on the other hand  we are bound to inform the police of the discovery  and to see that this poor fellow s body is looked after i could take a note back but i need your company and assistance  wait a bit  there is a fellow cutting peat up yonder  bring him over here  and he will guide the police i brought the peasant across  and holmes dispatched the frightened man with a note to dr  huxtable now  watson  said he  we have picked up two clues this morning  one is the bicycle with the palmer tire  and we see what that has led to the other is the bicycle with the patched dunlop  before we start to investigate that  let us try to realize what we do know  so as to make the most of it  and to separate the essential from the accidental first of all  i wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly left of his own free will  he got down from his window and he went off  either alone or with someone  that is sure i assented well  now  let us turn to this unfortunate german master  the boy was fully dressed when he fled  therefore  he foresaw what he would do but the german went without his socks  he certainly acted on very short notice undoubtedly why did he go  because  from his bedroom window  he saw the flight of the boy  because he wished to overtake him and bring him back  he seized his bicycle  pursued the lad  and in pursuing him met his death so it would seem now i come to the critical part of my argument  the natural action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after him  he would know that he could overtake him  but the german does not do so  he turns to his bicycle  i am told that he was an excellent cyclist  he would not do this  if he did not see that the boy had some swift means of escape the other bicycle let us continue our reconstruction  he meets his death five miles from the school not by a bullet  mark you  which even a lad might conceivably discharge  but by a savage blow dealt by a vigorous arm the lad  then  had a companion in his flight  and the flight was a swift one  since it took five miles before an expert cyclist could overtake them  yet we survey the ground round the scene of the tragedy  what do we find  a few cattle tracks  nothing more  i took a wide sweep round and there is no path within fifty yards  another cyclist could have had nothing to do with the actual murder  nor were there any human foot marks holmes  i cried  this is impossible admirable  he said  a most illuminating remark  it is impossible as i state it  and therefore i must in some respect have stated it wrong  yet you saw for yourself  can you suggest any fallacy he could not have fractured his skull in a fall in a morass  watson i am at my wit s end tut  tut  we have solved some worse problems  at least we have plenty of material  if we can only use it  come  then  and  having exhausted the palmer  let us see what the dunlop with the patched cover has to offer us we picked up the track and followed it onward for some distance  but soon the moor rose into a long  heather tufted curve  and we left the watercourse behind us  no further help from tracks could be hoped for at the spot where we saw the last of the dunlop tire it might equally have led to holdernesse hall  the stately towers of which rose some miles to our left  or to a low  gray village which lay in front of us and marked the position of the chesterfield high road as we approached the forbidding and squalid inn  with the sign of a game cock above the door  holmes gave a sudden groan  and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling  he had had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless  with difficulty he limped up to the door  where a squat  dark  elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe how are you  mr  reuben hayes  said holmes who are you  and how do you get my name so pat  the countryman answered  with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes well  it s printed on the board above your head  it s easy to see a man who is master of his own house  i suppose you haven t such a thing as a carriage in your stables no  i have not i can hardly put my foot to the ground don t put it to the ground but i can t walk well  then hop mr  reuben hayes s manner was far from gracious  but holmes took it with admirable good humour look here  my man  said he  this is really rather an awkward fix for me  i don t mind how i get on neither do i  said the morose landlord the matter is very important  i would offer you a sovereign for the use of a bicycle the landlord pricked up his ears where do you want to go to holdernesse hall pals of the dook  i suppose  said the landlord  surveying our mud stained garments with ironical eyes holmes laughed good naturedly he ll be glad to see us  anyhow why because we bring him news of his lost son the landlord gave a very visible start what  you re on his track he has been heard of in liverpool  they expect to get him every hour again a swift change passed over the heavy  unshaven face  his manner was suddenly genial i ve less reason to wish the dook well than most men  said he  for i was head coachman once  and cruel bad he treated me  it was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying corn chandler  but i m glad to hear that the young lord was heard of in liverpool  and i ll help you to take the news to the hall thank you  said holmes  we ll have some food first  then you can bring round the bicycle i haven t got a bicycle holmes held up a sovereign i tell you  man  that i haven t got one  i ll let you have two horses as far as the hall well  well  said holmes  we ll talk about it when we ve had something to eat when we were left alone in the stone flagged kitchen  it was astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered  it was nearly nightfall  and we had eaten nothing since early morning  so that we spent some time over our meal  holmes was lost in thought  and once or twice he walked over to the window and stared earnestly out  it opened on to a squalid courtyard  in the far corner was a smithy  where a grimy lad was at work  on the other side were the stables  holmes had sat down again after one of these excursions  when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with a loud exclamation by heaven  watson  i believe that i ve got it  he cried  yes  yes  it must be so  watson  do you remember seeing any cow tracks to day yes  several where well  everywhere  they were at the morass  and again on the path  and again near where poor heidegger met his death exactly  well  now  watson  how many cows did you see on the moor i don t remember seeing any strange  watson  that we should see tracks all along our line  but never a cow on the whole moor  very strange  watson  eh yes  it is strange now  watson  make an effort  throw your mind back  can you see those tracks upon the path yes  i can can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that  watson he arranged a number of bread crumbs in this fashion     and sometimes like this        and occasionally like this       can you remember that no  i cannot but i can  i could swear to it  however  we will go back at our leisure and verify it  what a blind beetle i have been  not to draw my conclusion and what is your conclusion only that it is a remarkable cow which walks  canters  and gallops  by george  watson  it was no brain of a country publican that thought out such a blind as that  the coast seems to be clear  save for that lad in the smithy  let us slip out and see what we can see there were two rough haired  unkempt horses in the tumble down stable holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed aloud old shoes  but newly shod old shoes  but new nails  this case deserves to be a classic  let us go across to the smithy the lad continued his work without regarding us  i saw holmes s eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood which was scattered about the floor  suddenly  however  we heard a step behind us  and there was the landlord  his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes  his swarthy features convulsed with passion  he held a short metal headed stick in his hand  and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that i was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket you infernal spies  the man cried  what are you doing there why  mr  reuben hayes  said holmes  coolly  one might think that you were afraid of our finding something out the man mastered himself with a violent effort  and his grim mouth loosened into a false laugh  which was more menacing than his frown you re welcome to all you can find out in my smithy  said he  but look here  mister  i don t care for folk poking about my place without my leave  so the sooner you pay your score and get out of this the better i shall be pleased all right  mr  hayes  no harm meant  said holmes  we have been having a look at your horses  but i think i ll walk  after all  it s not far  i believe not more than two miles to the hall gates  that s the road to the left  he watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his premises we did not go very far along the road  for holmes stopped the instant that the curve hid us from the landlord s view we were warm  as the children say  at that inn  said he  i seem to grow colder every step that i take away from it  no  no  i can t possibly leave it i am convinced  said i  that this reuben hayes knows all about it  a more self evident villain i never saw oh  he impressed you in that way  did he  there are the horses  there is the smithy  yes  it is an interesting place  this fighting cock  i think we shall have another look at it in an unobtrusive way a long  sloping hillside  dotted with gray limestone boulders  stretched behind us  we had turned off the road  and were making our way up the hill  when  looking in the direction of holdernesse hall  i saw a cyclist coming swiftly along get down  watson  cried holmes  with a heavy hand upon my shoulder  we had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us on the road  amid a rolling cloud of dust  i caught a glimpse of a pale  agitated face a face with horror in every lineament  the mouth open  the eyes staring wildly in front  it was like some strange caricature of the dapper james wilder whom we had seen the night before the duke s secretary  cried holmes  come  watson  let us see what he does we scrambled from rock to rock  until in a few moments we had made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of the inn wilder s bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it  no one was moving about the house  nor could we catch a glimpse of any faces at the windows  slowly the twilight crept down as the sun sank behind the high towers of holdernesse hall  then  in the gloom  we saw the two side lamps of a trap light up in the stable yard of the inn  and shortly afterwards heard the rattle of hoofs  as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a furious pace in the direction of chesterfield what do you make of that  watson  holmes whispered it looks like a flight a single man in a dog cart  so far as i could see  well  it certainly was not mr  james wilder  for there he is at the door a red square of light had sprung out of the darkness  in the middle of it was the black figure of the secretary  his head advanced  peering out into the night  it was evident that he was expecting someone  then at last there were steps in the road  a second figure was visible for an instant against the light  the door shut  and all was black once more five minutes later a lamp was lit in a room upon the first floor it seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the fighting cock  said holmes the bar is on the other side quite so  these are what one may call the private guests  now  what in the world is mr  james wilder doing in that den at this hour of night and who is the companion who comes to meet him there  come  watson we must really take a risk and try to investigate this a little more closely together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door of the inn  the bicycle still leaned against the wall  holmes struck a match and held it to the back wheel  and i heard him chuckle as the light fell upon a patched dunlop tire  up above us was the lighted window i must have a peep through that  watson  if you bend your back and support yourself upon the wall  i think that i can manage an instant later  his feet were on my shoulders  but he was hardly up before he was down again come  my friend  said he  our day s work has been quite long enough i think that we have gathered all that we can  it s a long walk to the school  and the sooner we get started the better he hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the moor  nor would he enter the school when he reached it  but went on to mackleton station  whence he could send some telegrams  late at night i heard him consoling dr  huxtable  prostrated by the tragedy of his master s death and later still he entered my room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the morning  all goes well  my friend  said he  i promise that before to morrow evening we shall have reached the solution of the mystery at eleven o clock next morning my friend and i were walking up the famous yew avenue of holdernesse hall  we were ushered through the magnificent elizabethan doorway and into his grace s study  there we found mr  james wilder  demure and courtly  but with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features you have come to see his grace  i am sorry  but the fact is that the duke is far from well  he has been very much upset by the tragic news we received a telegram from dr  huxtable yesterday afternoon  which told us of your discovery i must see the duke  mr  wilder but he is in his room then i must go to his room i believe he is in his bed i will see him there holmes s cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it was useless to argue with him very good  mr  holmes  i will tell him that you are here after an hour s delay  the great nobleman appeared  his face was more cadaverous than ever  his shoulders had rounded  and he seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the morning before  he greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated himself at his desk  his red beard streaming down on the table well  mr  holmes  said he but my friend s eyes were fixed upon the secretary  who stood by his master s chair i think  your grace  that i could speak more freely in mr  wilder s absence the man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at holmes if your grace wishes yes  yes  you had better go  now  mr  holmes  what have you to say my friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating secretary the fact is  your grace  said he  that my colleague  dr  watson  and myself had an assurance from dr  huxtable that a reward had been offered in this case  i should like to have this confirmed from your own lips certainly  mr  holmes it amounted  if i am correctly informed  to five thousand pounds to anyone who will tell you where your son is exactly and another thousand to the man who will name the person or persons who keep him in custody exactly under the latter heading is included  no doubt  not only those who may have taken him away  but also those who conspire to keep him in his present position yes  yes  cried the duke  impatiently  if you do your work well mr  sherlock holmes  you will have no reason to complain of niggardly treatment my friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of avidity which was a surprise to me  who knew his frugal tastes i fancy that i see your grace s check book upon the table  said he  i should be glad if you would make me out a check for six thousand pounds it would be as well  perhaps  for you to cross it  the capital and counties bank  oxford street branch are my agents his grace sat very stern and upright in his chair and looked stonily at my friend is this a joke  mr  holmes  it is hardly a subject for pleasantry not at all  your grace  i was never more earnest in my life what do you mean  then i mean that i have earned the reward  i know where your son is  and i know some  at least  of those who are holding him the duke s beard had turned more aggressively red than ever against his ghastly white face where is he  he gasped he is  or was last night  at the fighting cock inn  about two miles from your park gate the duke fell back in his chair and whom do you accuse sherlock holmes s answer was an astounding one  he stepped swiftly forward and touched the duke upon the shoulder i accuse you  said he  and now  your grace  i ll trouble you for that check never shall i forget the duke s appearance as he sprang up and clawed with his hands  like one who is sinking into an abyss  then  with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic self command  he sat down and sank his face in his hands  it was some minutes before he spoke how much do you know  he asked at last  without raising his head i saw you together last night does anyone else beside your friend know i have spoken to no one the duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his check book i shall be as good as my word  mr  holmes  i am about to write your check  however unwelcome the information which you have gained may be to me  when the offer was first made  i little thought the turn which events might take  but you and your friend are men of discretion  mr holmes i hardly understand your grace i must put it plainly  mr  holmes  if only you two know of this incident  there is no reason why it should go any farther  i think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that i owe you  is it not but holmes smiled and shook his head i fear  your grace  that matters can hardly be arranged so easily there is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted for but james knew nothing of that  you cannot hold him responsible for that  it was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the misfortune to employ i must take the view  your grace  that when a man embarks upon a crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring from it morally  mr  holmes  no doubt you are right  but surely not in the eyes of the law  a man cannot be condemned for a murder at which he was not present  and which he loathes and abhors as much as you do  the instant that he heard of it he made a complete confession to me  so filled was he with horror and remorse  he lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer  oh  mr  holmes  you must save him you must save him  i tell you that you must save him  the duke had dropped the last attempt at self command  and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands raving in the air  at last he mastered himself and sat down once more at his desk  i appreciate your conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else  said he  at least  we may take counsel how far we can minimize this hideous scandal exactly  said holmes  i think  your grace  that this can only be done by absolute frankness between us  i am disposed to help your grace to the best of my ability  but  in order to do so  i must understand to the last detail how the matter stands  i realize that your words applied to mr  james wilder  and that he is not the murderer no  the murderer has escaped sherlock holmes smiled demurely your grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which i possess  or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape me  mr reuben hayes was arrested at chesterfield  on my information  at eleven o clock last night  i had a telegram from the head of the local police before i left the school this morning the duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my friend you seem to have powers that are hardly human  said he  so reuben hayes is taken  i am right glad to hear it  if it will not react upon the fate of james your secretary no  sir  my son it was holmes s turn to look astonished i confess that this is entirely new to me  your grace  i must beg you to be more explicit i will conceal nothing from you  i agree with you that complete frankness  however painful it may be to me  is the best policy in this desperate situation to which james s folly and jealousy have reduced us  when i was a very young man  mr  holmes  i loved with such a love as comes only once in a lifetime  i offered the lady marriage  but she refused it on the grounds that such a match might mar my career  had she lived  i would certainly never have married anyone else  she died  and left this one child  whom for her sake i have cherished and cared for i could not acknowledge the paternity to the world  but i gave him the best of educations  and since he came to manhood i have kept him near my person  he surmised my secret  and has presumed ever since upon the claim which he has upon me  and upon his power of provoking a scandal which would be abhorrent to me  his presence had something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage  above all  he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a persistent hatred  you may well ask me why  under these circumstances  i still kept james under my roof i answer that it was because i could see his mother s face in his  and that for her dear sake there was no end to my long suffering  all her pretty ways too there was not one of them which he could not suggest and bring back to my memory  i could not send him away  but i feared so much lest he should do arthur that is  lord saltire a mischief  that i dispatched him for safety to dr  huxtable s school james came into contact with this fellow hayes  because the man was a tenant of mine  and james acted as agent  the fellow was a rascal from the beginning  but  in some extraordinary way  james became intimate with him  he had always a taste for low company  when james determined to kidnap lord saltire  it was of this man s service that he availed himself  you remember that i wrote to arthur upon that last day  well james opened the letter and inserted a note asking arthur to meet him in a little wood called the ragged shaw  which is near to the school he used the duchess s name  and in that way got the boy to come  that evening james bicycled over i am telling you what he has himself confessed to me and he told arthur  whom he met in the wood  that his mother longed to see him  that she was awaiting him on the moor  and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse  who would take him to her  poor arthur fell into the trap he came to the appointment  and found this fellow hayes with a led pony arthur mounted  and they set off together  it appears though this james only heard yesterday that they were pursued  that hayes struck the pursuer with his stick  and that the man died of his injuries  hayes brought arthur to his public house  the fighting cock  where he was confined in an upper room  under the care of mrs  hayes  who is a kindly woman  but entirely under the control of her brutal husband well  mr  holmes  that was the state of affairs when i first saw you two days ago  i had no more idea of the truth than you  you will ask me what was james s motive in doing such a deed  i answer that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir  in his view he should himself have been heir of all my estates  and he deeply resented those social laws which made it impossible  at the same time  he had a definite motive also  he was eager that i should break the entail  and he was of opinion that it lay in my power to do so  he intended to make a bargain with me to restore arthur if i would break the entail  and so make it possible for the estate to be left to him by will  he knew well that i should never willingly invoke the aid of the police against him  i say that he would have proposed such a bargain to me  but he did not actually do so  for events moved too quickly for him  and he had not time to put his plans into practice what brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery of this man heidegger s dead body  james was seized with horror at the news  it came to us yesterday  as we sat together in this study  dr  huxtable had sent a telegram  james was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions  which had never been entirely absent  rose instantly to a certainty  and i taxed him with the deed  he made a complete voluntary confession  then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer  so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life  i yielded as i have always yielded to his prayers  and instantly james hurried off to the fighting cock to warn hayes and give him the means of flight  i could not go there by daylight without provoking comment  but as soon as night fell i hurried off to see my dear arthur  i found him safe and well  but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed  in deference to my promise  and much against my will  i consented to leave him there for three days under the charge of mrs  hayes  since it was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer  and i could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate james  you asked for frankness mr  holmes  and i have taken you at your word  for i have now told you everything without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment  do you in turn be as frank with me i will  said holmes  in the first place  your grace  i am bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious position in the eyes of the law  you have condoned a felony  and you have aided the escape of a murderer  for i cannot doubt that any money which was taken by james wilder to aid his accomplice in his flight came from your grace s purse the duke bowed his assent this is  indeed  a most serious matter  even more culpable in my opinion  your grace  is your attitude towards your younger son  you leave him in this den for three days under solemn promises what are promises to such people as these  you have no guarantee that he will not be spirited away again  to humour your guilty elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent and unnecessary danger  it was a most unjustifiable action the proud lord of holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated in his own ducal hall  the blood flushed into his high forehead  but his conscience held him dumb i will help you  but on one condition only  it is that you ring for the footman and let me give such orders as i like without a word  the duke pressed the electric bell  a servant entered you will be glad to hear  said holmes  that your young master is found  it is the duke s desire that the carriage shall go at once to the fighting cock inn to bring lord saltire home now  said holmes  when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared  having secured the future  we can afford to be more lenient with the past  i am not in an official position  and there is no reason  so long as the ends of justice are served  why i should disclose all that i know  as to hayes  i say nothing  the gallows awaits him  and i would do nothing to save him from it  what he will divulge i cannot tell  but i have no doubt that your grace could make him understand that it is to his interest to be silent  from the police point of view he will have kidnapped the boy for the purpose of ransom  if they do not themselves find it out  i see no reason why i should prompt them to take a broader point of view  i would warn your grace  however  that the continued presence of mr  james wilder in your household can only lead to misfortune i understand that  mr  holmes  and it is already settled that he shall leave me forever  and go to seek his fortune in australia in that case  your grace  since you have yourself stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence i would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the duchess  and that you try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted that also i have arranged  mr  holmes  i wrote to the duchess this morning in that case  said holmes  rising  i think that my friend and i can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from our little visit to the north  there is one other small point upon which i desire some light  this fellow hayes had shod his horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows  was it from mr  wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device the duke stood in thought for a moment  with a look of intense surprise on his face  then he opened a door and showed us into a large room furnished as a museum  he led the way to a glass case in a corner  and pointed to the inscription these shoes  it ran  were dug up in the moat of holdernesse hall they are for the use of horses  but they are shaped below with a cloven foot of iron  so as to throw pursuers off the track  they are supposed to have belonged to some of the marauding barons of holdernesse in the middle ages holmes opened the case  and moistening his finger he passed it along the shoe  a thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin thank you  said he  as he replaced the glass  it is the second most interesting object that i have seen in the north and the first holmes folded up his check and placed it carefully in his notebook  i am a poor man  said he  as he patted it affectionately  and thrust it into the depths of his inner pocket the adventure of black peter i have never known my friend to be in better form  both mental and physical  than in the year  his increasing fame had brought with it an immense practice  and i should be guilty of an indiscretion if i were even to hint at the identity of some of the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in baker street  holmes  however  like all great artists  lived for his art s sake  and  save in the case of the duke of holdernesse  i have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable services  so unworldly was he or so capricious that he frequently refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem made no appeal to his sympathies  while he would devote weeks of most intense application to the affairs of some humble client whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity in this memorable year  a curious and incongruous succession of cases had engaged his attention  ranging from his famous investigation of the sudden death of cardinal tosca an inquiry which was carried out by him at the express desire of his holiness the pope down to his arrest of wilson  the notorious canary trainer  which removed a plague spot from the east end of london  close on the heels of these two famous cases came the tragedy of woodman s lee  and the very obscure circumstances which surrounded the death of captain peter carey  no record of the doings of mr  sherlock holmes would be complete which did not include some account of this very unusual affair during the first week of july  my friend had been absent so often and so long from our lodgings that i knew he had something on hand  the fact that several rough looking men called during that time and inquired for captain basil made me understand that holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity  he had at least five small refuges in different parts of london  in which he was able to change his personality  he said nothing of his business to me  and it was not my habit to force a confidence  the first positive sign which he gave me of the direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary one  he had gone out before breakfast  and i had sat down to mine when he strode into the room  his hat upon his head and a huge barbed headed spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm good gracious  holmes  i cried  you don t mean to say that you have been walking about london with that thing i drove to the butcher s and back the butcher s and i return with an excellent appetite  there can be no question my dear watson  of the value of exercise before breakfast  but i am prepared to bet that you will not guess the form that my exercise has taken i will not attempt it he chuckled as he poured out the coffee if you could have looked into allardyce s back shop  you would have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling  and a gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this weapon  i was that energetic person  and i have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can i transfix the pig with a single blow  perhaps you would care to try not for worlds  but why were you doing this because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the mystery of woodman s lee  ah  hopkins  i got your wire last night  and i have been expecting you  come and join us our visitor was an exceedingly alert man  thirty years of age  dressed in a quiet tweed suit  but retaining the erect bearing of one who was accustomed to official uniform  i recognized him at once as stanley hopkins  a young police inspector  for whose future holmes had high hopes  while he in turn professed the admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of the famous amateur  hopkins s brow was clouded  and he sat down with an air of deep dejection no  thank you  sir  i breakfasted before i came round  i spent the night in town  for i came up yesterday to report and what had you to report failure  sir  absolute failure you have made no progress none dear me  i must have a look at the matter i wish to heavens that you would  mr  holmes  it s my first big chance and i am at my wit s end  for goodness  sake  come down and lend me a hand well  well  it just happens that i have already read all the available evidence  including the report of the inquest  with some care  by the way  what do you make of that tobacco pouch  found on the scene of the crime  is there no clue there hopkins looked surprised it was the man s own pouch  sir  his initials were inside it  and it was of sealskin and he was an old sealer but he had no pipe no  sir  we could find no pipe  indeed  he smoked very little  and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends no doubt  i only mention it because  if i had been handling the case i should have been inclined to make that the starting point of my investigation  however  my friend  dr  watson  knows nothing of this matter  and i should be none the worse for hearing the sequence of events once more  just give us some short sketches of the essentials stanley hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket i have a few dates here which will give you the career of the dead man captain peter carey  he was born in fifty years of age  he was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher  in  he commanded the steam sealer sea unicorn  of dundee  he had then had several successful voyages in succession  and in the following year   he retired  after that he travelled for some years  and finally he bought a small place called woodman s lee  near forest row  in sussex  there he has lived for six years  and there he died just a week ago to day there were some most singular points about the man  in ordinary life  he was a strict puritan a silent  gloomy fellow  his household consisted of his wife  his daughter  aged twenty  and two female servants  these last were continually changing  for it was never a very cheery situation  and sometimes it became past all bearing  the man was an intermittent drunkard  and when he had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend  he has been known to drive his wife and daughter out of doors in the middle of the night and flog them through the park until the whole village outside the gates was aroused by their screams he was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar  who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct  in short mr  holmes  you would go far before you found a more dangerous man than peter carey  and i have heard that he bore the same character when he commanded his ship  he was known in the trade as black peter  and the name was given him  not only on account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard  but for the humours which were the terror of all around him  i need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his neighbours  and that i have not heard one single word of sorrow about his terrible end you must have read in the account of the inquest about the man s cabin mr  holmes  but perhaps your friend here has not heard of it  he had built himself a wooden outhouse he always called it the cabin a few hundred yards from his house  and it was here that he slept every night it was a little  single roomed hut  sixteen feet by ten  he kept the key in his pocket  made his own bed  cleaned it himself  and allowed no other foot to cross the threshold  there are small windows on each side which were covered by curtains and never opened  one of these windows was turned towards the high road  and when the light burned in it at night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what black peter was doing in there  that s the window  mr  holmes  which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came out at the inquest you remember that a stonemason  named slater  walking from forest row about one o clock in the morning two days before the murder stopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square of light still shining among the trees  he swears that the shadow of a man s head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind  and that this shadow was certainly not that of peter carey  whom he knew well  it was that of a bearded man  but the beard was short and bristled forward in a way very different from that of the captain  so he says  but he had been two hours in the public house  and it is some distance from the road to the window  besides  this refers to the monday  and the crime was done upon the wednesday on the tuesday  peter carey was in one of his blackest moods  flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast  he roamed about the house  and the women ran for it when they heard him coming  late in the evening  he went down to his own hut  about two o clock the following morning  his daughter  who slept with her window open  heard a most fearful yell from that direction  but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout when he was in drink  so no notice was taken  on rising at seven  one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open but so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him  peeping into the open door  they saw a sight which sent them flying  with white faces  into the village  within an hour  i was on the spot and had taken over the case well  i have fairly steady nerves  as you know  mr  holmes  but i give you my word  that i got a shake when i put my head into that little house  it was droning like a harmonium with the flies and bluebottles and the floor and walls were like a slaughter house  he had called it a cabin  and a cabin it was  sure enough  for you would have thought that you were in a ship  there was a bunk at one end  a sea chest  maps and charts  a picture of the sea unicorn  a line of logbooks on a shelf  all exactly as one would expect to find it in a captain s room  and there in the middle of it  was the man himself his face twisted like a lost soul in torment  and his great brindled beard stuck upward in his agony right through his broad breast a steel harpoon had been driven  and it had sunk deep into the wood of the wall behind him  he was pinned like a beetle on a card  of course  he was quite dead  and had been so from the instant that he had uttered that last yell of agony i know your methods  sir  and i applied them  before i permitted anything to be moved  i examined most carefully the ground outside  and also the floor of the room  there were no footmarks meaning that you saw none i assure you  sir  that there were none my good hopkins  i have investigated many crimes  but i have never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature  as long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be some indentation some abrasion  some trifling displacement which can be detected by the scientific searcher  it is incredible that this blood bespattered room contained no trace which could have aided us  i understand  however from the inquest that there were some objects which you failed to overlook the young inspector winced at my companion s ironical comments i was a fool not to call you in at the time mr  holmes  however  that s past praying for now  yes  there were several objects in the room which called for special attention  one was the harpoon with which the deed was committed  it had been snatched down from a rack on the wall  two others remained there  and there was a vacant place for the third on the stock was engraved ss  sea unicorn  dundee  this seemed to establish that the crime had been done in a moment of fury  and that the murderer had seized the first weapon which came in his way  the fact that the crime was committed at two in the morning  and yet peter carey was fully dressed  suggested that he had an appointment with the murderer  which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and two dirty glasses stood upon the table yes  said holmes  i think that both inferences are permissible  was there any other spirit but rum in the room yes  there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the sea chest  it is of no importance to us  however  since the decanters were full  and it had therefore not been used for all that  its presence has some significance  said holmes however  let us hear some more about the objects which do seem to you to bear upon the case there was this tobacco pouch upon the table what part of the table it lay in the middle  it was of coarse sealskin the straight haired skin  with a leather thong to bind it  inside was p c  on the flap there was half an ounce of strong ship s tobacco in it excellent  what more stanley hopkins drew from his pocket a drab covered notebook  the outside was rough and worn  the leaves discoloured  on the first page were written the initials j h n  and the date  holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way  while hopkins and i gazed over each shoulder  on the second page were the printed letters c p r  and then came several sheets of numbers  another heading was argentine  another costa rica  and another san paulo  each with pages of signs and figures after it what do you make of these  asked holmes they appear to be lists of stock exchange securities  i thought that j h n  were the initials of a broker  and that c p r  may have been his client try canadian pacific railway  said holmes stanley hopkins swore between his teeth  and struck his thigh with his clenched hand what a fool i have been  he cried  of course  it is as you say  then j h n  are the only initials we have to solve  i have already examined the old stock exchange lists  and i can find no one in  either in the house or among the outside brokers  whose initials correspond with these  yet i feel that the clue is the most important one that i hold you will admit  mr  holmes  that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the second person who was present in other words of the murderer  i would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the first time some indication of a motive for the crime sherlock holmes s face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback by this new development i must admit both your points  said he  i confess that this notebook which did not appear at the inquest  modifies any views which i may have formed  i had come to a theory of the crime in which i can find no place for this  have you endeavoured to trace any of the securities here mentioned inquiries are now being made at the offices  but i fear that the complete register of the stockholders of these south american concerns is in south america  and that some weeks must elapse before we can trace the shares holmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his magnifying lens surely there is some discolouration here  said he yes  sir  it is a blood stain  i told you that i picked the book off the floor was the blood stain above or below on the side next the boards which proves  of course  that the book was dropped after the crime was committed exactly  mr  holmes  i appreciated that point  and i conjectured that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight  it lay near the door i suppose that none of these securities have been found among the property of the dead man no  sir have you any reason to suspect robbery no  sir  nothing seemed to have been touched dear me  it is certainly a very interesting case  then there was a knife  was there not a sheath knife  still in its sheath  it lay at the feet of the dead man  mrs  carey has identified it as being her husband s property holmes was lost in thought for some time well  said he  at last  i suppose i shall have to come out and have a look at it stanley hopkins gave a cry of joy thank you  sir  that will  indeed  be a weight off my mind holmes shook his finger at the inspector it would have been an easier task a week ago  said he  but even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless  watson  if you can spare the time  i should be very glad of your company  if you will call a four wheeler  hopkins  we shall be ready to start for forest row in a quarter of an hour alighting at the small wayside station  we drove for some miles through the remains of widespread woods  which were once part of that great forest which for so long held the saxon invaders at bay the impenetrable weald  for sixty years the bulwark of britain  vast sections of it have been cleared  for this is the seat of the first iron works of the country  and the trees have been felled to smelt the ore  now the richer fields of the north have absorbed the trade  and nothing save these ravaged groves and great scars in the earth show the work of the past  here  in a clearing upon the green slope of a hill stood a long  low  stone house  approached by a curving drive running through the fields  nearer the road  and surrounded on three sides by bushes  was a small outhouse  one window and the door facing in our direction  it was the scene of the murder stanley hopkins led us first to the house  where he introduced us to a haggard  gray haired woman  the widow of the murdered man  whose gaunt and deep lined face  with the furtive look of terror in the depths of her red rimmed eyes  told of the years of hardship and ill usage which she had endured  with her was her daughter  a pale  fair haired girl whose eyes blazed defiantly at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead  and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down  it was a terrible household that black peter carey had made for himself  and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man the outhouse was the simplest of dwellings  wooden walled shingle roofed  one window beside the door and one on the farther side stanley hopkins drew the key from his pocket and had stooped to the lock  when he paused with a look of attention and surprise upon his face someone has been tampering with it  he said there could be no doubt of the fact  the woodwork was cut  and the scratches showed white through the paint  as if they had been that instant done  holmes had been examining the window someone has tried to force this also  whoever it was has failed to make his way in  he must have been a very poor burglar this is a most extraordinary thing  said the inspector  i could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening some curious person from the village  perhaps  i suggested very unlikely  few of them would dare to set foot in the grounds  far less try to force their way into the cabin  what do you think of it  mr holmes i think that fortune is very kind to us you mean that the person will come again it is very probable  he came expecting to find the door open  he tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife  he could not manage it  what would he do come again next night with a more useful tool so i should say  it will be our fault if we are not there to receive him  meanwhile  let me see the inside of the cabin the traces of the tragedy had been removed  but the furniture within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of the crime  for two hours  with most intense concentration  holmes examined every object in turn  but his face showed that his quest was not a successful one once only he paused in his patient investigation have you taken anything off this shelf  hopkins no  i have moved nothing something has been taken  there is less dust in this corner of the shelf than elsewhere  it may have been a book lying on its side  it may have been a box  well  well  i can do nothing more  let us walk in these beautiful woods  watson  and give a few hours to the birds and the flowers  we shall meet you here later  hopkins  and see if we can come to closer quarters with the gentleman who has paid this visit in the night it was past eleven o clock when we formed our little ambuscade  hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open  but holmes was of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the stranger  the lock was a perfectly simple one  and only a strong blade was needed to push it back  holmes also suggested that we should wait  not inside the hut but outside it  among the bushes which grew round the farther window in this way we should be able to watch our man if he struck a light  and see what his object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit it was a long and melancholy vigil  and yet brought with it something of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies beside the water pool and waits for the coming of the thirsty beast of prey  what savage creature was it which might steal upon us out of the darkness  was it a fierce tiger of crime  which could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw  or would it prove to be some skulking jackal dangerous only to the weak and unguarded in absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes  waiting for whatever might come  at first the steps of a few belated villagers  or the sound of voices from the village  lightened our vigil  but one by one these interruptions died away  and an absolute stillness fell upon us  save for the chimes of the distant church  which told us of the progress of the night  and for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the foliage which roofed us in half past two had chimed  and it was the darkest hour which precedes the dawn  when we all started as a low but sharp click came from the direction of the gate  someone had entered the drive  again there was a long silence  and i had begun to fear that it was a false alarm  when a stealthy step was heard upon the other side of the hut  and a moment later a metallic scraping and clinking  the man was trying to force the lock  this time his skill was greater or his tool was better  for there was a sudden snap and the creak of the hinges  then a match was struck and next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior of the hut  through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted upon the scene within the nocturnal visitor was a young man  frail and thin  with a black moustache  which intensified the deadly pallor of his face  he could not have been much above twenty years of age  i have never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable fright  for his teeth were visibly chattering  and he was shaking in every limb  he was dressed like a gentleman  in norfolk jacket and knickerbockers  with a cloth cap upon his head  we watched him staring round with frightened eyes  then he laid the candle end upon the table and disappeared from our view into one of the corners  he returned with a large book  one of the logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves  leaning on the table  he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he came to the entry which he sought  then  with an angry gesture of his clenched hand  he closed the book  replaced it in the corner  and put out the light  he had hardly turned to leave the hut when hopkin s hand was on the fellow s collar  and i heard his loud gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken  the candle was relit  and there was our wretched captive shivering and cowering in the grasp of the detective  he sank down upon the sea chest  and looked helplessly from one of us to the other now  my fine fellow  said stanley hopkins  who are you  and what do you want here the man pulled himself together  and faced us with an effort at self composure you are detectives  i suppose  said he  you imagine i am connected with the death of captain peter carey  i assure you that i am innocent we ll see about that  said hopkins  first of all  what is your name it is john hopley neligan i saw holmes and hopkins exchange a quick glance what are you doing here can i speak confidentially no  certainly not why should i tell you if you have no answer  it may go badly with you at the trial the young man winced well  i will tell you  he said  why should i not  and yet i hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life  did you ever hear of dawson and neligan i could see  from hopkins s face  that he never had  but holmes was keenly interested you mean the west country bankers  said he  they failed for a million  ruined half the county families of cornwall  and neligan disappeared exactly  neligan was my father at last we were getting something positive  and yet it seemed a long gap between an absconding banker and captain peter carey pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons  we all listened intently to the young man s words it was my father who was really concerned  dawson had retired  i was only ten years of age at the time  but i was old enough to feel the shame and horror of it all  it has always been said that my father stole all the securities and fled  it is not true  it was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize them  all would be well and every creditor paid in full  he started in his little yacht for norway just before the warrant was issued for his arrest  i can remember that last night when he bade farewell to my mother  he left us a list of the securities he was taking  and he swore that he would come back with his honour cleared  and that none who had trusted him would suffer  well no word was ever heard from him again  both the yacht and he vanished utterly  we believed  my mother and i  that he and it  with the securities that he had taken with him  were at the bottom of the sea  we had a faithful friend  however  who is a business man  and it was he who discovered some time ago that some of the securities which my father had with him had reappeared on the london market  you can imagine our amazement  i spent months in trying to trace them  and at last  after many doubtings and difficulties  i discovered that the original seller had been captain peter carey  the owner of this hut naturally  i made some inquiries about the man  i found that he had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to norway  the autumn of that year was a stormy one  and there was a long succession of southerly gales  my father s yacht may well have been blown to the north  and there met by captain peter carey s ship  if that were so  what had become of my father  in any case  if i could prove from peter carey s evidence how these securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father had not sold them  and that he had no view to personal profit when he took them i came down to sussex with the intention of seeing the captain  but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred  i read at the inquest a description of his cabin  in which it stated that the old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it  it struck me that if i could see what occurred in the month of august   on board the sea unicorn  i might settle the mystery of my father s fate  i tried last night to get at these logbooks  but was unable to open the door to night i tried again and succeeded  but i find that the pages which deal with that month have been torn from the book  it was at that moment i found myself a prisoner in your hands is that all  asked hopkins yes  that is all  his eyes shifted as he said it you have nothing else to tell us he hesitated no  there is nothing you have not been here before last night no then how do you account for that  cried hopkins  as he held up the damning notebook  with the initials of our prisoner on the first leaf and the blood stain on the cover the wretched man collapsed  he sank his face in his hands  and trembled all over where did you get it  he groaned  i did not know  i thought i had lost it at the hotel that is enough  said hopkins  sternly  whatever else you have to say  you must say in court  you will walk down with me now to the police station  well  mr  holmes  i am very much obliged to you and to your friend for coming down to help me  as it turns out your presence was unnecessary  and i would have brought the case to this successful issue without you  but  none the less  i am grateful  rooms have been reserved for you at the brambletye hotel  so we can all walk down to the village together well  watson  what do you think of it  asked holmes  as we travelled back next morning i can see that you are not satisfied oh  yes  my dear watson  i am perfectly satisfied  at the same time  stanley hopkins s methods do not commend themselves to me  i am disappointed in stanley hopkins  i had hoped for better things from him one should always look for a possible alternative  and provide against it  it is the first rule of criminal investigation what  then  is the alternative the line of investigation which i have myself been pursuing  it may give us nothing  i cannot tell  but at least i shall follow it to the end several letters were waiting for holmes at baker street  he snatched one of them up  opened it  and burst out into a triumphant chuckle of laughter excellent  watson  the alternative develops  have you telegraph forms  just write a couple of messages for me  sumner  shipping agent  ratcliff highway  send three men on  to arrive ten to morrow morning basil  that s my name in those parts  the other is inspector stanley hopkins   lord street  brixton  come breakfast to morrow at nine thirty  important  wire if unable to come sherlock holmes  there  watson  this infernal case has haunted me for ten days i hereby banish it completely from my presence  to morrow  i trust that we shall hear the last of it forever sharp at the hour named inspector stanley hopkins appeared  and we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which mrs  hudson had prepared the young detective was in high spirits at his success you really think that your solution must be correct  asked holmes i could not imagine a more complete case it did not seem to me conclusive you astonish me  mr  holmes  what more could one ask for does your explanation cover every point undoubtedly  i find that young neligan arrived at the brambletye hotel on the very day of the crime  he came on the pretence of playing golf his room was on the ground floor  and he could get out when he liked that very night he went down to woodman s lee  saw peter carey at the hut  quarrelled with him  and killed him with the harpoon  then horrified by what he had done  he fled out of the hut  dropping the notebook which he had brought with him in order to question peter carey about these different securities  you may have observed that some of them were marked with ticks  and the others the great majority were not  those which are ticked have been traced on the london market  but the others  presumably  were still in the possession of carey  and young neligan  according to his own account  was anxious to recover them in order to do the right thing by his father s creditors  after his flight he did not dare to approach the hut again for some time  but at last he forced himself to do so in order to obtain the information which he needed  surely that is all simple and obvious holmes smiled and shook his head  it seems to me to have only one drawback  hopkins  and that is that it is intrinsically impossible  have you tried to drive a harpoon through a body  no  tut  tut my dear sir you must really pay attention to these details  my friend watson could tell you that i spent a whole morning in that exercise  it is no easy matter  and requires a strong and practised arm  but this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall  do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault  is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with black peter in the dead of the night  was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before  no  no  hopkins  it is another and more formidable person for whom we must seek the detective s face had grown longer and longer during holmes s speech his hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him  but he would not abandon his position without a struggle you can t deny that neligan was present that night  mr  holmes  the book will prove that  i fancy that i have evidence enough to satisfy a jury  even if you are able to pick a hole in it  besides  mr  holmes i have laid my hand upon my man  as to this terrible person of yours where is he i rather fancy that he is on the stair  said holmes  serenely  i think  watson  that you would do well to put that revolver where you can reach it  he rose and laid a written paper upon a side table  now we are ready  said he there had been some talking in gruff voices outside  and now mrs  hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring for captain basil show them in one by one  said holmes the first who entered was a little ribston pippin of a man  with ruddy cheeks and fluffy white side whiskers  holmes had drawn a letter from his pocket what name  he asked james lancaster i am sorry  lancaster  but the berth is full  here is half a sovereign for your trouble  just step into this room and wait there for a few minutes the second man was a long  dried up creature  with lank hair and sallow cheeks  his name was hugh pattins  he also received his dismissal  his half sovereign  and the order to wait the third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance  a fierce bull dog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard  and two bold dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick  tufted  overhung eyebrows he saluted and stood sailor fashion  turning his cap round in his hands your name  asked holmes patrick cairns harpooner yes  sir  twenty six voyages dundee  i suppose yes  sir and ready to start with an exploring ship yes  sir what wages eight pounds a month could you start at once as soon as i get my kit have you your papers yes  sir  he took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his pocket holmes glanced over them and returned them you are just the man i want  said he  here s the agreement on the side table  if you sign it the whole matter will be settled the seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen shall i sign here  he asked  stooping over the table holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his neck this will do  said he i heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull  the next instant holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground together  he was a man of such gigantic strength that  even with the handcuffs which holmes had so deftly fastened upon his wrists  he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had hopkins and i not rushed to his rescue  only when i pressed the cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last understand that resistance was vain  we lashed his ankles with cord  and rose breathless from the struggle i must really apologize  hopkins  said sherlock holmes  i fear that the scrambled eggs are cold  however  you will enjoy the rest of your breakfast all the better  will you not  for the thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant conclusion stanley hopkins was speechless with amazement i don t know what to say  mr  holmes  he blurted out at last  with a very red face  it seems to me that i have been making a fool of myself from the beginning  i understand now  what i should never have forgotten  that i am the pupil and you are the master  even now i see what you have done  but i don t know how you did it or what it signifies well  well  said holmes  good humouredly  we all learn by experience and your lesson this time is that you should never lose sight of the alternative  you were so absorbed in young neligan that you could not spare a thought to patrick cairns  the true murderer of peter carey the hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation see here  mister  said he  i make no complaint of being man handled in this fashion  but i would have you call things by their right names you say i murdered peter carey  i say i killed peter carey  and there s all the difference  maybe you don t believe what i say  maybe you think i am just slinging you a yarn not at all  said holmes  let us hear what you have to say it s soon told  and  by the lord  every word of it is truth  i knew black peter  and when he pulled out his knife i whipped a harpoon through him sharp  for i knew that it was him or me  that s how he died you can call it murder  anyhow  i d as soon die with a rope round my neck as with black peter s knife in my heart how came you there  asked holmes i ll tell it you from the beginning  just sit me up a little  so as i can speak easy  it was in  that it happened august of that year peter carey was master of the sea unicorn  and i was spare harpooner  we were coming out of the ice pack on our way home  with head winds and a week s southerly gale  when we picked up a little craft that had been blown north  there was one man on her a landsman  the crew had thought she would founder and had made for the norwegian coast in the dinghy  i guess they were all drowned  well  we took him on board  this man  and he and the skipper had some long talks in the cabin  all the baggage we took off with him was one tin box  so far as i know  the man s name was never mentioned  and on the second night he disappeared as if he had never been  it was given out that he had either thrown himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that we were having  only one man knew what had happened to him  and that was me  for  with my own eyes  i saw the skipper tip up his heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark night  two days before we sighted the shetland lights  well  i kept my knowledge to myself  and waited to see what would come of it  when we got back to scotland it was easily hushed up  and nobody asked any questions  a stranger died by accident and it was nobody s business to inquire  shortly after peter carey gave up the sea  and it was long years before i could find where he was  i guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was in that tin box  and that he could afford now to pay me well for keeping my mouth shut  i found out where he was through a sailor man that had met him in london and down i went to squeeze him  the first night he was reasonable enough  and was ready to give me what would make me free of the sea for life  we were to fix it all two nights later  when i came  i found him three parts drunk and in a vile temper  we sat down and we drank and we yarned about old times  but the more he drank the less i liked the look on his face  i spotted that harpoon upon the wall  and i thought i might need it before i was through  then at last he broke out at me  spitting and cursing  with murder in his eyes and a great clasp knife in his hand  he had not time to get it from the sheath before i had the harpoon through him  heavens  what a yell he gave  and his face gets between me and my sleep  i stood there  with his blood splashing round me  and i waited for a bit  but all was quiet  so i took heart once more  i looked round  and there was the tin box on the shelf  i had as much right to it as peter carey  anyhow  so i took it with me and left the hut  like a fool i left my baccy pouch upon the table now i ll tell you the queerest part of the whole story  i had hardly got outside the hut when i heard someone coming  and i hid among the bushes  a man came slinking along  went into the hut  gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost  and legged it as hard as he could run until he was out of sight  who he was or what he wanted is more than i can tell for my part i walked ten miles  got a train at tunbridge wells  and so reached london  and no one the wiser well  when i came to examine the box i found there was no money in it and nothing but papers that i would not dare to sell  i had lost my hold on black peter and was stranded in london without a shilling  there was only my trade left  i saw these advertisements about harpooners  and high wages  so i went to the shipping agents  and they sent me here that s all i know  and i say again that if i killed black peter  the law should give me thanks  for i saved them the price of a hempen rope a very clear statement said holmes  rising and lighting his pipe  i think  hopkins  that you should lose no time in conveying your prisoner to a place of safety  this room is not well adapted for a cell  and mr patrick cairns occupies too large a proportion of our carpet mr  holmes  said hopkins  i do not know how to express my gratitude even now i do not understand how you attained this result simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the beginning  it is very possible if i had known about this notebook it might have led away my thoughts  as it did yours  but all i heard pointed in the one direction  the amazing strength  the skill in the use of the harpoon  the rum and water  the sealskin tobacco pouch with the coarse tobacco all these pointed to a seaman  and one who had been a whaler  i was convinced that the initials p c  upon the pouch were a coincidence  and not those of peter carey  since he seldom smoked  and no pipe was found in his cabin  you remember that i asked whether whisky and brandy were in the cabin  you said they were  how many landsmen are there who would drink rum when they could get these other spirits  yes i was certain it was a seaman and how did you find him my dear sir  the problem had become a very simple one  if it were a seaman  it could only be a seaman who had been with him on the sea unicorn  so far as i could learn he had sailed in no other ship  i spent three days in wiring to dundee  and at the end of that time i had ascertained the names of the crew of the sea unicorn in  when i found patrick cairns among the harpooners  my research was nearing its end  i argued that the man was probably in london  and that he would desire to leave the country for a time  i therefore spent some days in the east end  devised an arctic expedition  put forth tempting terms for harpooners who would serve under captain basil and behold the result wonderful  cried hopkins  wonderful you must obtain the release of young neligan as soon as possible  said holmes  i confess that i think you owe him some apology  the tin box must be returned to him  but  of course  the securities which peter carey has sold are lost forever  there s the cab  hopkins  and you can remove your man  if you want me for the trial  my address and that of watson will be somewhere in norway i ll send particulars later the adventure of charles augustus milverton it is years since the incidents of which i speak took place  and yet it is with diffidence that i allude to them  for a long time  even with the utmost discretion and reticence  it would have been impossible to make the facts public  but now the principal person concerned is beyond the reach of human law  and with due suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no one  it records an absolutely unique experience in the career both of mr  sherlock holmes and of myself  the reader will excuse me if i conceal the date or any other fact by which he might trace the actual occurrence we had been out for one of our evening rambles  holmes and i  and had returned about six o clock on a cold  frosty winter s evening  as holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card on the table  he glanced at it  and then  with an ejaculation of disgust  threw it on the floor i picked it up and read charles augustus milverton  appledore towers  hampstead  agent who is he  i asked the worst man in london  holmes answered  as he sat down and stretched his legs before the fire  is anything on the back of the card i turned it over will call at c a m  i read hum  he s about due  do you feel a creeping  shrinking sensation watson  when you stand before the serpents in the zoo  and see the slithery  gliding  venomous creatures  with their deadly eyes and wicked  flattened faces  well  that s how milverton impresses me  i ve had to do with fifty murderers in my career  but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which i have for this fellow  and yet i can t get out of doing business with him indeed  he is here at my invitation but who is he i ll tell you  watson  he is the king of all the blackmailers  heaven help the man  and still more the woman  whose secret and reputation come into the power of milverton  with a smiling face and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has drained them dry  the fellow is a genius in his way  and would have made his mark in some more savoury trade  his method is as follows  he allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and position  he receives these wares not only from treacherous valets or maids  but frequently from genteel ruffians  who have gained the confidence and affection of trusting women  he deals with no niggard hand  i happen to know that he paid seven hundred pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length  and that the ruin of a noble family was the result  everything which is in the market goes to milverton  and there are hundreds in this great city who turn white at his name  no one knows where his grip may fall  for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from hand to mouth  he will hold a card back for years in order to play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning i have said that he is the worst man in london  and i would ask you how could one compare the ruffian  who in hot blood bludgeons his mate with this man  who methodically and at his leisure tortures the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already swollen money bags i had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of feeling but surely  said i  the fellow must be within the grasp of the law technically  no doubt  but practically not  what would it profit a woman  for example  to get him a few months  imprisonment if her own ruin must immediately follow  his victims dare not hit back  if ever he blackmailed an innocent person  then indeed we should have him  but he is as cunning as the evil one  no  no  we must find other ways to fight him and why is he here because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my hands it is the lady eva blackwell  the most beautiful debutante of last season  she is to be married in a fortnight to the earl of dovercourt this fiend has several imprudent letters imprudent  watson  nothing worse which were written to an impecunious young squire in the country they would suffice to break off the match  milverton will send the letters to the earl unless a large sum of money is paid him  i have been commissioned to meet him  and to make the best terms i can at that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street below looking down i saw a stately carriage and pair  the brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble chestnuts  a footman opened the door  and a small  stout man in a shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended  a minute later he was in the room charles augustus milverton was a man of fifty  with a large intellectual head  a round  plump  hairless face  a perpetual frozen smile  and two keen gray eyes  which gleamed brightly from behind broad gold rimmed glasses  there was something of mr  pickwick s benevolence in his appearance  marred only by the insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those restless and penetrating eyes  his voice was as smooth and suave as his countenance  as he advanced with a plump little hand extended  murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first visit  holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him with a face of granite  milverton s smile broadened  he shrugged his shoulders removed his overcoat  folded it with great deliberation over the back of a chair  and then took a seat this gentleman  said he  with a wave in my direction  is it discreet is it right dr  watson is my friend and partner very good  mr  holmes  it is only in your client s interests that i protested  the matter is so very delicate dr  watson has already heard of it then we can proceed to business  you say that you are acting for lady eva  has she empowered you to accept my terms what are your terms seven thousand pounds and the alternative my dear sir  it is painful for me to discuss it  but if the money is not paid on the th  there certainly will be no marriage on the th his insufferable smile was more complacent than ever holmes thought for a little you appear to me  he said  at last  to be taking matters too much for granted  i am  of course  familiar with the contents of these letters my client will certainly do what i may advise  i shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and to trust to his generosity milverton chuckled you evidently do not know the earl  said he from the baffled look upon holmes s face  i could see clearly that he did what harm is there in the letters  he asked they are sprightly very sprightly  milverton answered  the lady was a charming correspondent  but i can assure you that the earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them  however  since you think otherwise  we will let it rest at that  it is purely a matter of business  if you think that it is in the best interests of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands of the earl  then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money to regain them he rose and seized his astrakhan coat holmes was gray with anger and mortification wait a little  he said  you go too fast  we should certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter milverton relapsed into his chair i was sure that you would see it in that light  he purred at the same time  holmes continued  lady eva is not a wealthy woman  i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain upon her resources  and that the sum you name is utterly beyond her power  i beg therefore  that you will moderate your demands  and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate  which is  i assure you  the highest that you can get milverton s smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously i am aware that what you say is true about the lady s resources said he  at the same time you must admit that the occasion of a lady s marriage is a very suitable time for her friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf  they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present  let me assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more joy than all the candelabra and butter dishes in london it is impossible  said holmes dear me  dear me  how unfortunate  cried milverton  taking out a bulky pocketbook  i cannot help thinking that ladies are ill advised in not making an effort  look at this  he held up a little note with a coat of arms upon the envelope  that belongs to well  perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until to morrow morning  but at that time it will be in the hands of the lady s husband  and all because she will not find a beggarly sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste  it is such a pity  now  you remember the sudden end of the engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking  only two days before the wedding  there was a paragraph in the morning post to say that it was all off  and why  it is almost incredible  but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would have settled the whole question  is it not pitiful  and here i find you  a man of sense boggling about terms  when your client s future and honour are at stake you surprise me  mr  holmes what i say is true  holmes answered  the money cannot be found surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which i offer than to ruin this woman s career  which can profit you in no way there you make a mistake  mr  holmes  an exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent  i have eight or ten similar cases maturing  if it was circulated among them that i had made a severe example of the lady eva  i should find all of them much more open to reason  you see my point holmes sprang from his chair get behind him  watson  don t let him out  now  sir  let us see the contents of that notebook milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room and stood with his back against the wall mr  holmes  mr  holmes  he said  turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver  which projected from the inside pocket  i have been expecting you to do something original  this has been done so often  and what good has ever come from it  i assure you that i am armed to the teeth  and i am perfectly prepared to use my weapons  knowing that the law will support me  besides  your supposition that i would bring the letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken i would do nothing so foolish  and now  gentlemen  i have one or two little interviews this evening  and it is a long drive to hampstead he stepped forward  took up his coat  laid his hand on his revolver  and turned to the door  i picked up a chair  but holmes shook his head  and i laid it down again  with bow  a smile  and a twinkle  milverton was out of the room  and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away holmes sat motionless by the fire  his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets  his chin sunk upon his breast  his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers  for half an hour he was silent and still  then  with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision  he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom  a little later a rakish young workman  with a goatee beard and a swagger  lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street  i ll be back some time  watson  said he  and vanished into the night  i understood that he had opened his campaign against charles augustus milverton  but i little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take for some days holmes came and went at all hours in this attire  but beyond a remark that his time was spent at hampstead  and that it was not wasted  i knew nothing of what he was doing  at last  however  on a wild  tempestuous evening  when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows  he returned from his last expedition  and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion you would not call me a marrying man  watson no  indeed you ll be interested to hear that i m engaged my dear fellow  i congrat to milverton s housemaid good heavens  holmes i wanted information  watson surely you have gone too far it was a most necessary step  i am a plumber with a rising business escott  by name  i have walked out with her each evening  and i have talked with her  good heavens  those talks  however  i have got all i wanted  i know milverton s house as i know the palm of my hand but the girl  holmes he shrugged his shoulders you can t help it  my dear watson  you must play your cards as best you can when such a stake is on the table  however  i rejoice to say that i have a hated rival  who will certainly cut me out the instant that my back is turned  what a splendid night it is you like this weather it suits my purpose  watson  i mean to burgle milverton s house to night i had a catching of the breath  and my skin went cold at the words which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated resolution  as a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an instant every detail of a wild landscape  so at one glance i seemed to see every possible result of such an action the detection  the capture  the honoured career ending in irreparable failure and disgrace  my friend himself lying at the mercy of the odious milverton for heaven s sake  holmes  think what you are doing  i cried my dear fellow  i have given it every consideration  i am never precipitate in my actions  nor would i adopt so energetic and  indeed so dangerous a course  if any other were possible  let us look at the matter clearly and fairly  i suppose that you will admit that the action is morally justifiable  though technically criminal  to burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take his pocketbook an action in which you were prepared to aid me i turned it over in my mind yes  i said  it is morally justifiable so long as our object is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal purpose exactly  since it is morally justifiable  i have only to consider the question of personal risk  surely a gentleman should not lay much stress upon this  when a lady is in most desperate need of his help you will be in such a false position well  that is part of the risk  there is no other possible way of regaining these letters  the unfortunate lady has not the money  and there are none of her people in whom she could confide  to morrow is the last day of grace  and unless we can get the letters to night  this villain will be as good as his word and will bring about her ruin  i must  therefore  abandon my client to her fate or i must play this last card  between ourselves  watson  it s a sporting duel between this fellow milverton and me  he had  as you saw  the best of the first exchanges  but my self respect and my reputation are concerned to fight it to a finish well  i don t like it  but i suppose it must be  said i  when do we start you are not coming then you are not going  said i  i give you my word of honour and i never broke it in my life that i will take a cab straight to the police station and give you away  unless you let me share this adventure with you you can t help me how do you know that  you can t tell what may happen  anyway  my resolution is taken  other people besides you have self respect  and even reputations holmes had looked annoyed  but his brow cleared  and he clapped me on the shoulder well  well  my dear fellow  be it so  we have shared this same room for some years  and it would be amusing if we ended by sharing the same cell  you know  watson  i don t mind confessing to you that i have always had an idea that i would have made a highly efficient criminal this is the chance of my lifetime in that direction  see here  he took a neat little leather case out of a drawer  and opening it he exhibited a number of shining instruments  this is a first class  up to date burgling kit  with nickel plated jemmy  diamond tipped glass cutter adaptable keys  and every modern improvement which the march of civilization demands  here  too  is my dark lantern  everything is in order  have you a pair of silent shoes i have rubber soled tennis shoes excellent  and a mask i can make a couple out of black silk i can see that you have a strong  natural turn for this sort of thing very good  do you make the masks  we shall have some cold supper before we start  it is now nine thirty  at eleven we shall drive as far as church row  it is a quarter of an hour s walk from there to appledore towers  we shall be at work before midnight  milverton is a heavy sleeper  and retires punctually at ten thirty  with any luck we should be back here by two  with the lady eva s letters in my pocket holmes and i put on our dress clothes  so that we might appear to be two theatre goers homeward bound  in oxford street we picked up a hansom and drove to an address in hampstead  here we paid off our cab  and with our great coats buttoned up  for it was bitterly cold  and the wind seemed to blow through us  we walked along the edge of the heath it s a business that needs delicate treatment  said holmes  these documents are contained in a safe in the fellow s study  and the study is the ante room of his bed chamber  on the other hand  like all these stout  little men who do themselves well  he is a plethoric sleeper agatha that s my fiancee says it is a joke in the servants  hall that it s impossible to wake the master  he has a secretary who is devoted to his interests  and never budges from the study all day  that s why we are going at night  then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden i met agatha late the last two evenings  and she locks the brute up so as to give me a clear run  this is the house  this big one in its own grounds  through the gate now to the right among the laurels  we might put on our masks here  i think  you see  there is not a glimmer of light in any of the windows  and everything is working splendidly with our black silk face coverings  which turned us into two of the most truculent figures in london  we stole up to the silent  gloomy house a sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of it  lined by several windows and two doors that s his bedroom  holmes whispered  this door opens straight into the study  it would suit us best  but it is bolted as well as locked and we should make too much noise getting in  come round here  there s a greenhouse which opens into the drawing room the place was locked  but holmes removed a circle of glass and turned the key from the inside  an instant afterwards he had closed the door behind us  and we had become felons in the eyes of the law  the thick warm air of the conservatory and the rich  choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat  he seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of shrubs which brushed against our faces  holmes had remarkable powers  carefully cultivated  of seeing in the dark still holding my hand in one of his  he opened a door  and i was vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a cigar had been smoked not long before  he felt his way among the furniture  opened another door  and closed it behind us  putting out my hand i felt several coats hanging from the wall  and i understood that i was in a passage  we passed along it and holmes very gently opened a door upon the right hand side  something rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth  but i could have laughed when i realized that it was the cat a fire was burning in this new room  and again the air was heavy with tobacco smoke  holmes entered on tiptoe  waited for me to follow  and then very gently closed the door  we were in milverton s study  and a portiere at the farther side showed the entrance to his bedroom it was a good fire  and the room was illuminated by it  near the door i saw the gleam of an electric switch  but it was unnecessary  even if it had been safe  to turn it on  at one side of the fireplace was a heavy curtain which covered the bay window we had seen from outside  on the other side was the door which communicated with the veranda  a desk stood in the centre  with a turning chair of shining red leather opposite was a large bookcase  with a marble bust of athene on the top in the corner  between the bookcase and the wall  there stood a tall green safe  the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs upon its face  holmes stole across and looked at it  then he crept to the door of the bedroom  and stood with slanting head listening intently  no sound came from within  meanwhile it had struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the outer door  so i examined it  to my amazement  it was neither locked nor bolted i touched holmes on the arm  and he turned his masked face in that direction  i saw him start  and he was evidently as surprised as i i don t like it  he whispered  putting his lips to my very ear  i can t quite make it out  anyhow  we have no time to lose can i do anything yes  stand by the door  if you hear anyone come  bolt it on the inside and we can get away as we came  if they come the other way  we can get through the door if our job is done  or hide behind these window curtains if it is not  do you understand i nodded  and stood by the door  my first feeling of fear had passed away  and i thrilled now with a keener zest than i had ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its defiers  the high object of our mission  the consciousness that it was unselfish and chivalrous the villainous character of our opponent  all added to the sporting interest of the adventure  far from feeling guilty  i rejoiced and exulted in our dangers  with a glow of admiration i watched holmes unrolling his case of instruments and choosing his tool with the calm scientific accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation  i knew that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him  and i understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this green and gold monster  the dragon which held in its maw the reputations of many fair ladies  turning up the cuffs of his dress coat he had placed his overcoat on a chair holmes laid out two drills  a jemmy  and several skeleton keys  i stood at the centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others  ready for any emergency  though  indeed  my plans were somewhat vague as to what i should do if we were interrupted  for half an hour  holmes worked with concentrated energy  laying down one tool  picking up another  handling each with the strength and delicacy of the trained mechanic  finally i heard a click  the broad green door swung open  and inside i had a glimpse of a number of paper packets each tied  sealed  and inscribed  holmes picked one out  but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire  and he drew out his little dark lantern  for it was too dangerous  with milverton in the next room  to switch on the electric light  suddenly i saw him halt  listen intently and then in an instant he had swung the door of the safe to  picked up his coat  stuffed his tools into the pockets  and darted behind the window curtain  motioning me to do the same it was only when i had joined him there that i heard what had alarmed his quicker senses  there was a noise somewhere within the house  a door slammed in the distance  then a confused  dull murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps rapidly approaching  they were in the passage outside the room  they paused at the door  the door opened there was a sharp snick as the electric light was turned on  the door closed once more  and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne to our nostrils  then the footsteps continued backward and forward backward and forward  within a few yards of us  finally there was a creak from a chair  and the footsteps ceased  then a key clicked in a lock  and i heard the rustle of papers so far i had not dared to look out  but now i gently parted the division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through  from the pressure of holmes s shoulder against mine  i knew that he was sharing my observations  right in front of us  and almost within our reach  was the broad  rounded back of milverton  it was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements  that he had never been to his bedroom but that he had been sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing of the house  the windows of which we had not seen  his broad  grizzled head  with its shining patch of baldness  was in the immediate foreground of our vision  he was leaning far back in the red leather chair  his legs outstretched  a long  black cigar projecting at an angle from his mouth  he wore a semi military smoking jacket claret coloured  with a black velvet collar  in his hand he held a long legal document which he was reading in an indolent fashion  blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips as he did so  there was no promise of a speedy departure in his composed bearing and his comfortable attitude i felt holmes s hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring shake  as if to say that the situation was within his powers  and that he was easy in his mind  i was not sure whether he had seen what was only too obvious from my position  that the door of the safe was imperfectly closed  and that milverton might at any moment observe it  in my own mind i had determined that if i were sure  from the rigidity of his gaze  that it had caught his eye  i would at once spring out  throw my great coat over his head  pinion him  and leave the rest to holmes  but milverton never looked up  he was languidly interested by the papers in his hand  and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the lawyer  at least  i thought  when he has finished the document and the cigar he will go to his room  but before he had reached the end of either  there came a remarkable development  which turned our thoughts into quite another channel several times i had observed that milverton looked at his watch  and once he had risen and sat down again  with a gesture of impatience  the idea  however  that he might have an appointment at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound reached my ears from the veranda outside  milverton dropped his papers and sat rigid in his chair  the sound was repeated  and then there came a gentle tap at the door  milverton rose and opened it well  said he  curtly  you are nearly half an hour late so this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the nocturnal vigil of milverton  there was the gentle rustle of a woman s dress  i had closed the slit between the curtains as milverton s face had turned in our direction  but now i ventured very carefully to open it once more  he had resumed his seat  the cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of his mouth  in front of him  in the full glare of the electric light  there stood a tall  slim  dark woman  a veil over her face  a mantle drawn round her chin  her breath came quick and fast and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with strong emotion well  said milverton  you made me lose a good night s rest  my dear i hope you ll prove worth it  you couldn t come any other time eh the woman shook her head well  if you couldn t you couldn t  if the countess is a hard mistress you have your chance to get level with her now  bless the girl  what are you shivering about  that s right  pull yourself together  now  let us get down to business  he took a notebook from the drawer of his desk you say that you have five letters which compromise the countess d albert  you want to sell them  i want to buy them  so far so good  it only remains to fix a price  i should want to inspect the letters  of course  if they are really good specimens great heavens  is it you the woman  without a word  had raised her veil and dropped the mantle from her chin  it was a dark  handsome  clear cut face which confronted milverton a face with a curved nose  strong  dark eyebrows shading hard  glittering eyes  and a straight  thin lipped mouth set in a dangerous smile it is i  she said  the woman whose life you have ruined milverton laughed  but fear vibrated in his voice  you were so very obstinate  said he  why did you drive me to such extremities  i assure you i wouldn t hurt a fly of my own accord  but every man has his business  and what was i to do  i put the price well within your means you would not pay so you sent the letters to my husband  and he the noblest gentleman that ever lived  a man whose boots i was never worthy to lace he broke his gallant heart and died  you remember that last night  when i came through that door  i begged and prayed you for mercy  and you laughed in my face as you are trying to laugh now  only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from twitching  yes  you never thought to see me here again  but it was that night which taught me how i could meet you face to face  and alone  well  charles milverton  what have you to say don t imagine that you can bully me  said he  rising to his feet  i have only to raise my voice and i could call my servants and have you arrested  but i will make allowance for your natural anger  leave the room at once as you came  and i will say no more the woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom  and the same deadly smile on her thin lips you will ruin no more lives as you have ruined mine  you will wring no more hearts as you wrung mine  i will free the world of a poisonous thing  take that  you hound and that and that and that she had drawn a little gleaming revolver  and emptied barrel after barrel into milverton s body  the muzzle within two feet of his shirt front  he shrank away and then fell forward upon the table  coughing furiously and clawing among the papers  then he staggered to his feet received another shot  and rolled upon the floor  you ve done me  he cried  and lay still  the woman looked at him intently  and ground her heel into his upturned face  she looked again  but there was no sound or movement  i heard a sharp rustle  the night air blew into the heated room  and the avenger was gone no interference upon our part could have saved the man from his fate but  as the woman poured bullet after bullet into milverton s shrinking body i was about to spring out  when i felt holmes s cold  strong grasp upon my wrist  i understood the whole argument of that firm  restraining grip that it was no affair of ours  that justice had overtaken a villain  that we had our own duties and our own objects  which were not to be lost sight of  but hardly had the woman rushed from the room when holmes  with swift  silent steps  was over at the other door  he turned the key in the lock  at the same instant we heard voices in the house and the sound of hurrying feet  the revolver shots had roused the household  with perfect coolness holmes slipped across to the safe filled his two arms with bundles of letters  and poured them all into the fire  again and again he did it  until the safe was empty  someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of the door  holmes looked swiftly round  the letter which had been the messenger of death for milverton lay  all mottled with his blood  upon the table  holmes tossed it in among the blazing papers  then he drew the key from the outer door  passed through after me  and locked it on the outside  this way watson  said he  we can scale the garden wall in this direction i could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so swiftly looking back  the huge house was one blaze of light  the front door was open  and figures were rushing down the drive  the whole garden was alive with people  and one fellow raised a view halloa as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at our heels  holmes seemed to know the grounds perfectly  and he threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees  i close at his heels  and our foremost pursuer panting behind us  it was a six foot wall which barred our path but he sprang to the top and over  as i did the same i felt the hand of the man behind me grab at my ankle  but i kicked myself free and scrambled over a grass strewn coping  i fell upon my face among some bushes  but holmes had me on my feet in an instant  and together we dashed away across the huge expanse of hampstead heath  we had run two miles  i suppose  before holmes at last halted and listened intently all was absolute silence behind us  we had shaken off our pursuers and were safe we had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day after the remarkable experience which i have recorded  when mr  lestrade  of scotland yard  very solemn and impressive  was ushered into our modest sitting room good morning  mr  holmes  said he  good morning  may i ask if you are very busy just now not too busy to listen to you i thought that  perhaps  if you had nothing particular on hand  you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case  which occurred only last night at hampstead dear me  said holmes  what was that a murder a most dramatic and remarkable murder  i know how keen you are upon these things  and i would take it as a great favour if you would step down to appledore towers  and give us the benefit of your advice  it is no ordinary crime  we have had our eyes upon this mr milverton for some time  and  between ourselves  he was a bit of a villain  he is known to have held papers which he used for blackmailing purposes  these papers have all been burned by the murderers  no article of value was taken  as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position  whose sole object was to prevent social exposure criminals  said holmes  plural yes  there were two of them  they were as nearly as possible captured red handed  we have their footmarks  we have their description  it s ten to one that we trace them  the first fellow was a bit too active  but the second was caught by the under gardener  and only got away after a struggle  he was a middle sized  strongly built man square jaw  thick neck  moustache  a mask over his eyes that s rather vague  said sherlock holmes  my  it might be a description of watson it s true  said the inspector  with amusement  it might be a description of watson well  i m afraid i can t help you  lestrade  said holmes  the fact is that i knew this fellow milverton  that i considered him one of the most dangerous men in london  and that i think there are certain crimes which the law cannot touch  and which therefore  to some extent  justify private revenge  no  it s no use arguing  i have made up my mind  my sympathies are with the criminals rather than with the victim  and i will not handle this case holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had witnessed  but i observed all the morning that he was in his most thoughtful mood  and he gave me the impression  from his vacant eyes and his abstracted manner  of a man who is striving to recall something to his memory  we were in the middle of our lunch  when he suddenly sprang to his feet  by jove  watson  i ve got it  he cried  take your hat come with me  he hurried at his top speed down baker street and along oxford street  until we had almost reached regent circus  here  on the left hand  there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the celebrities and beauties of the day  holmes s eyes fixed themselves upon one of them  and following his gaze i saw the picture of a regal and stately lady in court dress  with a high diamond tiara upon her noble head  i looked at that delicately curved nose  at the marked eyebrows at the straight mouth  and the strong little chin beneath it  then i caught my breath as i read the time honoured title of the great nobleman and statesman whose wife she had been  my eyes met those of holmes  and he put his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window the adventure of the six napoleons it was no very unusual thing for mr  lestrade  of scotland yard  to look in upon us of an evening  and his visits were welcome to sherlock holmes  for they enabled him to keep in touch with all that was going on at the police headquarters  in return for the news which lestrade would bring  holmes was always ready to listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the detective was engaged  and was able occasionally  without any active interference  to give some hint or suggestion drawn from his own vast knowledge and experience on this particular evening  lestrade had spoken of the weather and the newspapers  then he had fallen silent  puffing thoughtfully at his cigar  holmes looked keenly at him anything remarkable on hand  he asked oh  no  mr  holmes nothing very particular then tell me about it lestrade laughed well  mr  holmes  there is no use denying that there is something on my mind  and yet it is such an absurd business  that i hesitated to bother you about it  on the other hand  although it is trivial  it is undoubtedly queer  and i know that you have a taste for all that is out of the common  but  in my opinion  it comes more in dr  watson s line than ours disease  said i madness  anyhow  and a queer madness  too  you wouldn t think there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred of napoleon the first that he would break any image of him that he could see holmes sank back in his chair that s no business of mine  said he exactly  that s what i said  but then  when the man commits burglary in order to break images which are not his own  that brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman holmes sat up again burglary  this is more interesting  let me hear the details lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory from its pages the first case reported was four days ago  said he  it was at the shop of morse hudson  who has a place for the sale of pictures and statues in the kennington road  the assistant had left the front shop for an instant  when he heard a crash  and hurrying in he found a plaster bust of napoleon  which stood with several other works of art upon the counter  lying shivered into fragments  he rushed out into the road  but  although several passers by declared that they had noticed a man run out of the shop  he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of identifying the rascal  it seemed to be one of those senseless acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time  and it was reported to the constable on the beat as such  the plaster cast was not worth more than a few shillings  and the whole affair appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation the second case  however  was more serious  and also more singular  it occurred only last night in kennington road  and within a few hundred yards of morse hudson s shop  there lives a well known medical practitioner  named dr  barnicot who has one of the largest practices upon the south side of the thames his residence and principal consulting room is at kennington road  but he has a branch surgery and dispensary at lower brixton road  two miles away  this dr  barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of napoleon  and his house is full of books  pictures  and relics of the french emperor  some little time ago he purchased from morse hudson two duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of napoleon by the french sculptor  devine  one of these he placed in his hall in the house at kennington road  and the other on the mantelpiece of the surgery at lower brixton  well  when dr barnicot came down this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been burgled during the night  but that nothing had been taken save the plaster head from the hall  it had been carried out and had been dashed savagely against the garden wall  under which its splintered fragments were discovered holmes rubbed his hands this is certainly very novel  said he i thought it would please you  but i have not got to the end yet  dr barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve o clock  and you can imagine his amazement when  on arriving there  he found that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room  it had been smashed to atoms where it stood in neither case were there any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or lunatic who had done the mischief  now  mr  holmes  you have got the facts they are singular  not to say grotesque  said holmes  may i ask whether the two busts smashed in dr  barnicot s rooms were the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in morse hudson s shop they were taken from the same mould such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks them is influenced by any general hatred of napoleon  considering how many hundreds of statues of the great emperor must exist in london  it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three specimens of the same bust well  i thought as you do  said lestrade  on the other hand  this morse hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of london  and these three were the only ones which had been in his shop for years  so although  as you say  there are many hundreds of statues in london  it is very probable that these three were the only ones in that district therefore  a local fanatic would begin with them  what do you think  dr watson there are no limits to the possibilities of monomania  i answered there is the condition which the modern french psychologists have called the idee fixe  which may be trifling in character  and accompanied by complete sanity in every other way  a man who had read deeply about napoleon  or who had possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great war  might conceivably form such an idee fixe and under its influence be capable of any fantastic outrage that won t do  my dear watson  said holmes  shaking his head  for no amount of idee fixe would enable your interesting monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated well  how do you explain it i don t attempt to do so  i would only observe that there is a certain method in the gentleman s eccentric proceedings  for example  in dr barnicot s hall  where a sound might arouse the family  the bust was taken outside before being broken  whereas in the surgery  where there was less danger of an alarm  it was smashed where it stood  the affair seems absurdly trifling  and yet i dare call nothing trivial when i reflect that some of my most classic cases have had the least promising commencement  you will remember  watson  how the dreadful business of the abernetty family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day  i can t afford therefore  to smile at your three broken busts  lestrade  and i shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any fresh development of so singular a chain of events the development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined  i was still dressing in my bedroom next morning  when there was a tap at the door and holmes entered  a telegram in his hand  he read it aloud come instantly   pitt street  kensington lestrade what is it  then  i asked don t know may be anything  but i suspect it is the sequel of the story of the statues  in that case our friend the image breaker has begun operations in another quarter of london  there s coffee on the table  watson  and i have a cab at the door in half an hour we had reached pitt street  a quiet little backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of london life  no   was one of a row  all flat chested  respectable  and most unromantic dwellings as we drove up  we found the railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd  holmes whistled by george  it s attempted murder at the least  nothing less will hold the london message boy  there s a deed of violence indicated in that fellow s round shoulders and outstretched neck  what s this  watson  the top steps swilled down and the other ones dry  footsteps enough  anyhow well  well  there s lestrade at the front window  and we shall soon know all about it the official received us with a very grave face and showed us into a sitting room  where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated elderly man  clad in a flannel dressing gown  was pacing up and down  he was introduced to us as the owner of the house mr  horace harker  of the central press syndicate it s the napoleon bust business again  said lestrade  you seemed interested last night  mr  holmes  so i thought perhaps you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a very much graver turn what has it turned to  then to murder  mr  harker  will you tell these gentlemen exactly what has occurred the man in the dressing gown turned upon us with a most melancholy face it s an extraordinary thing  said he  that all my life i have been collecting other people s news  and now that a real piece of news has come my own way i am so confused and bothered that i can t put two words together  if i had come in here as a journalist  i should have interviewed myself and had two columns in every evening paper  as it is i am giving away valuable copy by telling my story over and over to a string of different people  and i can make no use of it myself  however i ve heard your name  mr  sherlock holmes  and if you ll only explain this queer business  i shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the story holmes sat down and listened it all seems to centre round that bust of napoleon which i bought for this very room about four months ago  i picked it up cheap from harding brothers  two doors from the high street station  a great deal of my journalistic work is done at night  and i often write until the early morning  so it was to day  i was sitting in my den  which is at the back of the top of the house  about three o clock  when i was convinced that i heard some sounds downstairs  i listened  but they were not repeated and i concluded that they came from outside  then suddenly  about five minutes later  there came a most horrible yell the most dreadful sound mr  holmes  that ever i heard  it will ring in my ears as long as i live  i sat frozen with horror for a minute or two  then i seized the poker and went downstairs  when i entered this room i found the window wide open  and i at once observed that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece  why any burglar should take such a thing passes my understanding  for it was only a plaster cast and of no real value whatever you can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride  this was clearly what the burglar had done  so i went round and opened the door  stepping out into the dark  i nearly fell over a dead man  who was lying there  i ran back for a light and there was the poor fellow  a great gash in his throat and the whole place swimming in blood  he lay on his back  his knees drawn up  and his mouth horribly open  i shall see him in my dreams  i had just time to blow on my police whistle  and then i must have fainted  for i knew nothing more until i found the policeman standing over me in the hall well  who was the murdered man  asked holmes there s nothing to show who he was  said lestrade  you shall see the body at the mortuary  but we have made nothing of it up to now  he is a tall man  sunburned  very powerful  not more than thirty  he is poorly dressed  and yet does not appear to be a labourer  a horn handled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood beside him  whether it was the weapon which did the deed  or whether it belonged to the dead man  i do not know  there was no name on his clothing  and nothing in his pockets save an apple  some string  a shilling map of london  and a photograph  here it is it was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera  it represented an alert  sharp featured simian man  with thick eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the face  like the muzzle of a baboon and what became of the bust  asked holmes  after a careful study of this picture we had news of it just before you came  it has been found in the front garden of an empty house in campden house road  it was broken into fragments  i am going round now to see it  will you come certainly  i must just take one look round  he examined the carpet and the window  the fellow had either very long legs or was a most active man  said he  with an area beneath  it was no mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window  getting back was comparatively simple  are you coming with us to see the remains of your bust  mr harker the disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a writing table i must try and make something of it  said he  though i have no doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out already with full details  it s like my luck  you remember when the stand fell at doncaster  well  i was the only journalist in the stand  and my journal the only one that had no account of it  for i was too shaken to write it  and now i ll be too late with a murder done on my own doorstep as we left the room  we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the foolscap the spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only a few hundred yards away  for the first time our eyes rested upon this presentment of the great emperor  which seemed to raise such frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown  it lay scattered  in splintered shards  upon the grass  holmes picked up several of them and examined them carefully  i was convinced  from his intent face and his purposeful manner  that at last he was upon a clue well  asked lestrade holmes shrugged his shoulders we have a long way to go yet  said he  and yet and yet well  we have some suggestive facts to act upon  the possession of this trifling bust was worth more  in the eyes of this strange criminal  than a human life  that is one point  then there is the singular fact that he did not break it in the house  or immediately outside the house  if to break it was his sole object he was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow  he hardly knew what he was doing well  that s likely enough  but i wish to call your attention very particularly to the position of this house  in the garden of which the bust was destroyed lestrade looked about him it was an empty house  and so he knew that he would not be disturbed in the garden yes  but there is another empty house farther up the street which he must have passed before he came to this one  why did he not break it there  since it is evident that every yard that he carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him i give it up  said lestrade holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads he could see what he was doing here  and he could not there  that was his reason by jove  that s true  said the detective  now that i come to think of it  dr  barnicot s bust was broken not far from his red lamp  well  mr holmes  what are we to do with that fact to remember it to docket it  we may come on something later which will bear upon it  what steps do you propose to take now  lestrade the most practical way of getting at it  in my opinion  is to identify the dead man  there should be no difficulty about that  when we have found who he is and who his associates are  we should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt street last night  and who it was who met him and killed him on the doorstep of mr  horace harker  don t you think so no doubt  and yet it is not quite the way in which i should approach the case what would you do then oh  you must not let me influence you in any way  i suggest that you go on your line and i on mine  we can compare notes afterwards  and each will supplement the other very good  said lestrade if you are going back to pitt street  you might see mr  horace harker tell him for me that i have quite made up my mind  and that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic  with napoleonic delusions was in his house last night  it will be useful for his article lestrade stared you don t seriously believe that holmes smiled don t i  well  perhaps i don t  but i am sure that it will interest mr horace harker and the subscribers of the central press syndicate now  watson  i think that we shall find that we have a long and rather complex day s work before us  i should be glad  lestrade  if you could make it convenient to meet us at baker street at six o clock this evening  until then i should like to keep this photograph  found in the dead man s pocket  it is possible that i may have to ask your company and assistance upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken to night  if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct  until then good bye and good luck sherlock holmes and i walked together to the high street  where we stopped at the shop of harding brothers  whence the bust had been purchased  a young assistant informed us that mr  harding would be absent until afternoon  and that he was himself a newcomer  who could give us no information  holmes s face showed his disappointment and annoyance well  well  we can t expect to have it all our own way  watson  he said  at last  we must come back in the afternoon  if mr  harding will not be here until then  i am  as you have no doubt surmised endeavouring to trace these busts to their source  in order to find if there is not something peculiar which may account for their remarkable fate  let us make for mr  morse hudson  of the kennington road  and see if he can throw any light upon the problem a drive of an hour brought us to the picture dealer s establishment  he was a small  stout man with a red face and a peppery manner yes  sir  on my very counter  sir  said he  what we pay rates and taxes for i don t know  when any ruffian can come in and break one s goods  yes  sir  it was i who sold dr  barnicot his two statues disgraceful  sir  a nihilist plot that s what i make it  no one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues  red republicans that s what i call em  who did i get the statues from  i don t see what that has to do with it  well  if you really want to know  i got them from gelder  co  in church street  stepney  they are a well known house in the trade  and have been this twenty years  how many had i  three two and one are three two of dr  barnicot s  and one smashed in broad daylight on my own counter  do i know that photograph  no  i don t  yes  i do though  why  it s beppo  he was a kind of italian piece work man  who made himself useful in the shop  he could carve a bit  and gild and frame  and do odd jobs  the fellow left me last week  and i ve heard nothing of him since  no  i don t know where he came from nor where he went to  i had nothing against him while he was here  he was gone two days before the bust was smashed well  that s all we could reasonably expect from morse hudson  said holmes  as we emerged from the shop  we have this beppo as a common factor  both in kennington and in kensington  so that is worth a ten mile drive  now  watson  let us make for gelder  co  of stepney the source and origin of the busts  i shall be surprised if we don t get some help down there in rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable london hotel london  theatrical london  literary london  commercial london and  finally  maritime london  till we came to a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls  where the tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of europe  here  in a broad thoroughfare  once the abode of wealthy city merchants  we found the sculpture works for which we searched  outside was a considerable yard full of monumental masonry inside was a large room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding the manager  a big blond german  received us civilly and gave a clear answer to all holmes s questions  a reference to his books showed that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of devine s head of napoleon  but that the three which had been sent to morse hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of six  the other three being sent to harding brothers  of kensington  there was no reason why those six should be different from any of the other casts  he could suggest no possible cause why anyone should wish to destroy them in fact  he laughed at the idea  their wholesale price was six shillings  but the retailer would get twelve or more  the cast was taken in two moulds from each side of the face  and then these two profiles of plaster of paris were joined together to make the complete bust  the work was usually done by italians  in the room we were in  when finished  the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry  and afterwards stored  that was all he could tell us but the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon the manager  his face flushed with anger  and his brows knotted over his blue teutonic eyes ah  the rascal  he cried  yes  indeed  i know him very well  this has always been a respectable establishment  and the only time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very fellow  it was more than a year ago now  he knifed another italian in the street  and then he came to the works with the police on his heels  and he was taken here  beppo was his name his second name i never knew  serve me right for engaging a man with such a face  but he was a good workman one of the best what did he get the man lived and he got off with a year  i have no doubt he is out now  but he has not dared to show his nose here  we have a cousin of his here  and i daresay he could tell you where he is no  no  cried holmes  not a word to the cousin not a word  i beg of you  the matter is very important  and the farther i go with it  the more important it seems to grow  when you referred in your ledger to the sale of those casts i observed that the date was june rd of last year could you give me the date when beppo was arrested i could tell you roughly by the pay list  the manager answered  yes he continued  after some turning over of pages  he was paid last on may th thank you  said holmes  i don t think that i need intrude upon your time and patience any more  with a last word of caution that he should say nothing as to our researches  we turned our faces westward once more the afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a hasty luncheon at a restaurant  a news bill at the entrance announced kensington outrage  murder by a madman  and the contents of the paper showed that mr  horace harker had got his account into print after all  two columns were occupied with a highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident  holmes propped it against the cruet stand and read it while he ate  once or twice he chuckled this is all right  watson  said he  listen to this it is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of opinion upon this case  since mr  lestrade  one of the most experienced members of the official force  and mr  sherlock holmes  the well known consulting expert  have each come to the conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents  which have ended in so tragic a fashion  arise from lunacy rather than from deliberate crime  no explanation save mental aberration can cover the facts the press  watson  is a most valuable institution  if you only know how to use it  and now  if you have quite finished  we will hark back to kensington and see what the manager of harding brothers has to say on the matter the founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk  crisp little person  very dapper and quick  with a clear head and a ready tongue yes  sir  i have already read the account in the evening papers  mr horace harker is a customer of ours  we supplied him with the bust some months ago  we ordered three busts of that sort from gelder  co  of stepney  they are all sold now  to whom  oh  i daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell you  yes  we have the entries here one to mr  harker you see  and one to mr  josiah brown  of laburnum lodge  laburnum vale  chiswick  and one to mr  sandeford  of lower grove road  reading  no  i have never seen this face which you show me in the photograph  you would hardly forget it  would you  sir  for i ve seldom seen an uglier  have we any italians on the staff  yes  sir  we have several among our workpeople and cleaners  i daresay they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to  there is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book  well  well  it s a very strange business  and i hope that you will let me know if anything comes of your inquiries holmes had taken several notes during mr  harding s evidence  and i could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which affairs were taking  he made no remark  however  save that  unless we hurried we should be late for our appointment with lestrade  sure enough  when we reached baker street the detective was already there  and we found him pacing up and down in a fever of impatience  his look of importance showed that his day s work had not been in vain well  he asked  what luck  mr  holmes we have had a very busy day  and not entirely a wasted one  my friend explained  we have seen both the retailers and also the wholesale manufacturers  i can trace each of the busts now from the beginning the busts  cried lestrade  well  well  you have your own methods  mr sherlock holmes  and it is not for me to say a word against them  but i think i have done a better day s work than you  i have identified the dead man you don t say so and found a cause for the crime splendid we have an inspector who makes a specialty of saffron hill and the italian quarter  well  this dead man had some catholic emblem round his neck  and that  along with his colour  made me think he was from the south  inspector hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him  his name is pietro venucci  from naples  and he is one of the greatest cut throats in london  he is connected with the mafia  which  as you know  is a secret political society  enforcing its decrees by murder now  you see how the affair begins to clear up  the other fellow is probably an italian also  and a member of the mafia  he has broken the rules in some fashion  pietro is set upon his track  probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man himself  so that he may not knife the wrong person  he dogs the fellow  he sees him enter a house he waits outside for him  and in the scuffle he receives his own death wound  how is that  mr  sherlock holmes holmes clapped his hands approvingly excellent  lestrade  excellent  he cried  but i didn t quite follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts the busts  you never can get those busts out of your head  after all that is nothing  petty larceny  six months at the most  it is the murder that we are really investigating  and i tell you that i am gathering all the threads into my hands and the next stage is a very simple one  i shall go down with hill to the italian quarter find the man whose photograph we have got  and arrest him on the charge of murder  will you come with us i think not  i fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way  i can t say for certain  because it all depends well  it all depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control  but i have great hopes in fact  the betting is exactly two to one that if you will come with us to night i shall be able to help you to lay him by the heels in the italian quarter no  i fancy chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him  if you will come with me to chiswick to night  lestrade  i ll promise to go to the italian quarter with you to morrow  and no harm will be done by the delay  and now i think that a few hours  sleep would do us all good for i do not propose to leave before eleven o clock  and it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning  you ll dine with us  lestrade  and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start  in the meantime  watson  i should be glad if you would ring for an express messenger  for i have a letter to send and it is important that it should go at once holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old daily papers with which one of our lumber rooms was packed  when at last he descended  it was with triumph in his eyes  but he said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches  for my own part  i had followed step by step the methods by which he had traced the various windings of this complex case  and  though i could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach  i understood clearly that holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts one of which  i remembered  was at chiswick  no doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act  and i could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper  so as to give the fellow the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity  i was not surprised when holmes suggested that i should take my revolver with me  he had himself picked up the loaded hunting crop  which was his favourite weapon a four wheeler was at the door at eleven  and in it we drove to a spot at the other side of hammersmith bridge  here the cabman was directed to wait  a short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed with pleasant houses  each standing in its own grounds  in the light of a street lamp we read laburnum villa  upon the gate post of one of them  the occupants had evidently retired to rest  for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door  which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path  the wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon the inner side  and here it was that we crouched i fear that you ll have a long wait  holmes whispered  we may thank our stars that it is not raining  i don t think we can even venture to smoke to pass the time  however  it s a two to one chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble it proved  however  that our vigil was not to be so long as holmes had led us to fear  and it ended in a very sudden and singular fashion  in an instant  without the least sound to warn us of his coming  the garden gate swung open  and a lithe  dark figure  as swift and active as an ape  rushed up the garden path  we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against the black shadow of the house there was a long pause  during which we held our breath  and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our ears  the window was being opened  the noise ceased  and again there was a long silence  the fellow was making his way into the house  we saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room  what he sought was evidently not there  for again we saw the flash through another blind  and then through another let us get to the open window  we will nab him as he climbs out lestrade whispered but before we could move  the man had emerged again  as he came out into the glimmering patch of light  we saw that he carried something white under his arm  he looked stealthily all round him  the silence of the deserted street reassured him  turning his back upon us he laid down his burden  and the next instant there was the sound of a sharp tap followed by a clatter and rattle  the man was so intent upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot with the bound of a tiger holmes was on his back  and an instant later lestrade and i had him by either wrist  and the handcuffs had been fastened  as we turned him over i saw a hideous  sallow face  with writhing  furious features  glaring up at us  and i knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had secured but it was not our prisoner to whom holmes was giving his attention squatted on the doorstep  he was engaged in most carefully examining that which the man had brought from the house  it was a bust of napoleon  like the one which we had seen that morning  and it had been broken into similar fragments  carefully holmes held each separate shard to the light  but in no way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster  he had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up  the door opened  and the owner of the house  a jovial  rotund figure in shirt and trousers  presented himself mr  josiah brown  i suppose  said holmes yes  sir  and you  no doubt  are mr  sherlock holmes  i had the note which you sent by the express messenger  and i did exactly what you told me  we locked every door on the inside and awaited developments  well i m very glad to see that you have got the rascal  i hope  gentlemen that you will come in and have some refreshment however  lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters  so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four upon our way to london  not a word would our captive say  but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair  and once  when my hand seemed within his reach  he snapped at it like a hungry wolf  we stayed long enough at the police station to learn that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath knife  the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood that s all right  said lestrade  as we parted  hill knows all these gentry  and he will give a name to him  you ll find that my theory of the mafia will work out all right  but i m sure i am exceedingly obliged to you  mr  holmes  for the workmanlike way in which you laid hands upon him  i don t quite understand it all yet i fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations  said holmes besides  there are one or two details which are not finished off  and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very end if you will come round once more to my rooms at six o clock to morrow  i think i shall be able to show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of this business  which presents some features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime  if ever i permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems  watson  i foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular adventure of the napoleonic busts when we met again next evening  lestrade was furnished with much information concerning our prisoner  his name  it appeared  was beppo second name unknown  he was a well known ne er do well among the italian colony  he had once been a skilful sculptor and had earned an honest living  but he had taken to evil courses and had twice already been in jail once for a petty theft  and once  as we had already heard  for stabbing a fellow countryman  he could talk english perfectly well  his reasons for destroying the busts were still unknown  and he refused to answer any questions upon the subject  but the police had discovered that these same busts might very well have been made by his own hands since he was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of gelder  co  to all this information  much of which we already knew holmes listened with polite attention  but i  who knew him so well could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere  and i detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to assume  at last he started in his chair  and his eyes brightened  there had been a ring at the bell  a minute later we heard steps upon the stairs  and an elderly red faced man with grizzled side whiskers was ushered in  in his right hand he carried an old fashioned carpet bag  which he placed upon the table is mr  sherlock holmes here my friend bowed and smiled  mr  sandeford  of reading  i suppose  said he yes  sir  i fear that i am a little late  but the trains were awkward you wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession exactly i have your letter here  you said  i desire to possess a copy of devine s napoleon  and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one which is in your possession  is that right certainly i was very much surprised at your letter  for i could not imagine how you knew that i owned such a thing of course you must have been surprised  but the explanation is very simple  mr  harding  of harding brothers  said that they had sold you their last copy  and he gave me your address oh  that was it  was it  did he tell you what i paid for it no  he did not well  i am an honest man  though not a very rich one  i only gave fifteen shillings for the bust  and i think you ought to know that before i take ten pounds from you i am sure the scruple does you honour  mr  sandeford  but i have named that price  so i intend to stick to it well  it is very handsome of you  mr  holmes  i brought the bust up with me  as you asked me to do  here it is  he opened his bag  and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust which we had already seen more than once in fragments holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten pound note upon the table you will kindly sign that paper  mr  sandeford  in the presence of these witnesses  it is simply to say that you transfer every possible right that you ever had in the bust to me  i am a methodical man  you see  and you never know what turn events might take afterwards  thank you  mr  sandeford  here is your money  and i wish you a very good evening when our visitor had disappeared  sherlock holmes s movements were such as to rivet our attention  he began by taking a clean white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table  then he placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth  finally  he picked up his hunting crop and struck napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the head  the figure broke into fragments  and holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains  next instant  with a loud shout of triumph he held up one splinter  in which a round  dark object was fixed like a plum in a pudding gentlemen  he cried  let me introduce you to the famous black pearl of the borgias lestrade and i sat silent for a moment  and then  with a spontaneous impulse  we both broke at clapping  as at the well wrought crisis of a play  a flush of colour sprang to holmes s pale cheeks  and he bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his audience it was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine  and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause  the same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend yes  gentlemen  said he  it is the most famous pearl now existing in the world  and it has been my good fortune  by a connected chain of inductive reasoning  to trace it from the prince of colonna s bedroom at the dacre hotel  where it was lost  to the interior of this  the last of the six busts of napoleon which were manufactured by gelder  co of stepney  you will remember  lestrade  the sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the london police to recover it  i was myself consulted upon the case  but i was unable to throw any light upon it  suspicion fell upon the maid of the princess  who was an italian  and it was proved that she had a brother in london  but we failed to trace any connection between them  the maid s name was lucretia venucci  and there is no doubt in my mind that this pietro who was murdered two nights ago was the brother  i have been looking up the dates in the old files of the paper  and i find that the disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of beppo  for some crime of violence an event which took place in the factory of gelder  co  at the very moment when these busts were being made  now you clearly see the sequence of events  though you see them of course  in the inverse order to the way in which they presented themselves to me  beppo had the pearl in his possession  he may have stolen it from pietro  he may have been pietro s confederate  he may have been the go between of pietro and his sister  it is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution the main fact is that he had the pearl  and at that moment  when it was on his person  he was pursued by the police  he made for the factory in which he worked  and he knew that he had only a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize  which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched  six plaster casts of napoleon were drying in the passage  one of them was still soft  in an instant beppo  a skilful workman  made a small hole in the wet plaster  dropped in the pearl  and with a few touches covered over the aperture once more  it was an admirable hiding place  no one could possibly find it  but beppo was condemned to a year s imprisonment  and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over london  he could not tell which contained his treasure  only by breaking them could he see  even shaking would tell him nothing  for as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to it as  in fact  it has done  beppo did not despair  and he conducted his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance through a cousin who works with gelder  he found out the retail firms who had bought the busts  he managed to find employment with morse hudson  and in that way tracked down three of them  the pearl was not there  then  with the help of some italian employee  he succeeded in finding out where the other three busts had gone  the first was at harker s  there he was dogged by his confederate  who held beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl  and he stabbed him in the scuffle which followed if he was his confederate  why should he carry his photograph  i asked as a means of tracing him  if he wished to inquire about him from any third person  that was the obvious reason  well  after the murder i calculated that beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his movements  he would fear that the police would read his secret  and so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him  of course  i could not say that he had not found the pearl in harker s bust  i had not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl  but it was evident to me that he was looking for something  since he carried the bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp overlooking it  since harker s bust was one in three  the chances were exactly as i told you two to one against the pearl being inside it there remained two busts  and it was obvious that he would go for the london one first  i warned the inmates of the house  so as to avoid a second tragedy  and we went down  with the happiest results  by that time  of course  i knew for certain that it was the borgia pearl that we were after  the name of the murdered man linked the one event with the other  there only remained a single bust the reading one and the pearl must be there  i bought it in your presence from the owner and there it lies we sat in silence for a moment well  said lestrade  i ve seen you handle a good many cases  mr holmes  but i don t know that i ever knew a more workmanlike one than that  we re not jealous of you at scotland yard  no  sir  we are very proud of you  and if you come down to morrow  there s not a man  from the oldest inspector to the youngest constable  who wouldn t be glad to shake you by the hand thank you  said holmes  thank you  and as he turned away  it seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than i had ever seen him  a moment later he was the cold and practical thinker once more  put the pearl in the safe  watson  said he  and get out the papers of the conk singleton forgery case  good bye  lestrade  if any little problem comes your way  i shall be happy  if i can  to give you a hint or two as to its solution the adventure of the three students it was in the year  that a combination of events  into which i need not enter  caused mr  sherlock holmes and myself to spend some weeks in one of our great university towns  and it was during this time that the small but instructive adventure which i am about to relate befell us  it will be obvious that any details which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive so painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out  with due discretion the incident itself may  however  be described  since it serves to illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was remarkable i will endeavour  in my statement  to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place  or give a clue as to the people concerned we were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library where sherlock holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early english charters researches which led to results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my future narratives  here it was that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance  mr  hilton soames tutor and lecturer at the college of st  luke s  mr  soames was a tall spare man  of a nervous and excitable temperament  i had always known him to be restless in his manner  but on this particular occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear something very unusual had occurred i trust  mr  holmes  that you can spare me a few hours of your valuable time  we have had a very painful incident at st  luke s  and really  but for the happy chance of your being in town  i should have been at a loss what to do i am very busy just now  and i desire no distractions  my friend answered  i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the police no  no  my dear sir  such a course is utterly impossible  when once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again  and this is just one of those cases where  for the credit of the college  it is most essential to avoid scandal  your discretion is as well known as your powers  and you are the one man in the world who can help me  i beg you  mr  holmes  to do what you can my friend s temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the congenial surroundings of baker street  without his scrapbooks  his chemicals  and his homely untidiness  he was an uncomfortable man  he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence  while our visitor in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth his story i must explain to you  mr  holmes  that to morrow is the first day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship  i am one of the examiners  my subject is greek  and the first of the papers consists of a large passage of greek translation which the candidate has not seen this passage is printed on the examination paper  and it would naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it in advance for this reason  great care is taken to keep the paper secret to day  about three o clock  the proofs of this paper arrived from the printers  the exercise consists of half a chapter of thucydides  i had to read it over carefully  as the text must be absolutely correct  at four thirty my task was not yet completed  i had  however  promised to take tea in a friend s rooms  so i left the proof upon my desk  i was absent rather more than an hour you are aware  mr  holmes  that our college doors are double a green baize one within and a heavy oak one without  as i approached my outer door  i was amazed to see a key in it  for an instant i imagined that i had left my own there  but on feeling in my pocket i found that it was all right  the only duplicate which existed  so far as i knew  was that which belonged to my servant  bannister a man who has looked after my room for ten years  and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion  i found that the key was indeed his  that he had entered my room to know if i wanted tea  and that he had very carelessly left the key in the door when he came out  his visit to my room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it  his forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion  but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable consequences the moment i looked at my table  i was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers  the proof was in three long slips  i had left them all together  now  i found that one of them was lying on the floor  one was on the side table near the window  and the third was where i had left it holmes stirred for the first time the first page on the floor  the second in the window  the third where you left it  said he exactly  mr  holmes  you amaze me  how could you possibly know that pray continue your very interesting statement for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable liberty of examining my papers  he denied it  however  with the utmost earnestness  and i am convinced that he was speaking the truth  the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door had known that i was out  and had entered to look at the papers  a large sum of money is at stake  for the scholarship is a very valuable one and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an advantage over his fellows bannister was very much upset by the incident  he had nearly fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with  i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair  while i made a most careful examination of the room  i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled papers  on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened  a broken tip of lead was lying there also  evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry  had broken his pencil  and had been compelled to put a fresh point to it excellent  said holmes  who was recovering his good humour as his attention became more engrossed by the case  fortune has been your friend this was not all  i have a new writing table with a fine surface of red leather  i am prepared to swear  and so is bannister  that it was smooth and unstained  now i found a clean cut in it about three inches long not a mere scratch  but a positive cut  not only this  but on the table i found a small ball of black dough or clay  with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it  i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers  there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity  i was at my wit s end  when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that you were in the town  and i came straight round to put the matter into your hands  do help me  mr  holmes  you see my dilemma  either i must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are prepared and since this cannot be done without explanation  there will ensue a hideous scandal  which will throw a cloud not only on the college but on the university  above all things  i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly i shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as i can  said holmes  rising and putting on his overcoat  the case is not entirely devoid of interest  had anyone visited you in your room after the papers came to you yes  young daulat ras  an indian student  who lives on the same stair came in to ask me some particulars about the examination for which he was entered yes and the papers were on your table to the best of my belief  they were rolled up but might be recognized as proofs possibly no one else in your room no did anyone know that these proofs would be there no one save the printer did this man bannister know no  certainly not  no one knew where is bannister now he was very ill  poor fellow  i left him collapsed in the chair  i was in such a hurry to come to you you left your door open i locked up the papers first then it amounts to this  mr  soames  that  unless the indian student recognized the roll as being proofs  the man who tampered with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there so it seems to me holmes gave an enigmatic smile well  said he  let us go round  not one of your cases watson mental  not physical  all right  come if you want to  now  mr soames at your disposal the sitting room of our client opened by a long  low  latticed window on to the ancient lichen tinted court of the old college  a gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase  on the ground floor was the tutor s room  above were three students  one on each story  it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem  holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window  then he approached it  and  standing on tiptoe with his neck craned  he looked into the room he must have entered through the door  there is no opening except the one pane  said our learned guide dear me  said holmes  and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced at our companion  well  if there is nothing to be learned here  we had best go inside the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room  we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination of the carpet i am afraid there are no signs here  said he  one could hardly hope for any upon so dry a day  your servant seems to have quite recovered you left him in a chair  you say  which chair by the window there i see  near this little table  you can come in now  i have finished with the carpet  let us take the little table first  of course  what has happened is very clear  the man entered and took the papers  sheet by sheet  from the central table  he carried them over to the window table because from there he could see if you came across the courtyard  and so could effect an escape as a matter of fact  he could not  said soames  for i entered by the side door ah  that s good  well  anyhow  that was in his mind  let me see the three strips  no finger impressions no  well  he carried over this one first  and he copied it  how long would it take him to do that  using every possible contraction  a quarter of an hour  not less  then he tossed it down and seized the next  he was in the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat very hurried since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell you that he had been there  you were not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the outer door no  i can t say i was well  he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil  and had  as you observe  to sharpen it again  this is of interest  watson  the pencil was not an ordinary one  it was above the usual size  with a soft lead the outer colour was dark blue  the maker s name was printed in silver lettering  and the piece remaining is only about an inch and a half long  look for such a pencil  mr  soames  and you have got your man when i add that he possesses a large and very blunt knife  you have an additional aid mr  soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information  i can follow the other points  said he  but really  in this matter of the length holmes held out a small chip with the letters nn and a space of clear wood after them you see no  i fear that even now watson  i have always done you an injustice  there are others  what could this nn be  it is at the end of a word  you are aware that johann faber is the most common maker s name  is it not clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the johann  he held the small table sideways to the electric light  i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin  some trace of it might come through upon this polished surface  no  i see nothing  i don t think there is anything more to be learned here  now for the central table this small pellet is  i presume  the black  doughy mass you spoke of roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out  i perceive  as you say there appear to be grains of sawdust in it  dear me  this is very interesting  and the cut a positive tear  i see  it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole  i am much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case  mr  soames  where does that door lead to to my bedroom have you been in it since your adventure no  i came straight away for you i should like to have a glance round  what a charming  old fashioned room  perhaps you will kindly wait a minute  until i have examined the floor  no  i see nothing  what about this curtain  you hang your clothes behind it  if anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there  since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow  no one there  i suppose as holmes drew the curtain i was aware  from some little rigidity and alertness of his attitude  that he was prepared for an emergency  as a matter of fact  the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs  holmes turned away  and stooped suddenly to the floor halloa  what s this  said he it was a small pyramid of black  putty like stuff  exactly like the one upon the table of the study  holmes held it out on his open palm in the glare of the electric light your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in your sitting room  mr  soames what could he have wanted there i think it is clear enough  you came back by an unexpected way  and so he had no warning until you were at the very door  what could he do he caught up everything which would betray him  and he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself good gracious  mr  holmes  do you mean to tell me that  all the time i was talking to bannister in this room  we had the man prisoner if we had only known it so i read it surely there is another alternative  mr  holmes  i don t know whether you observed my bedroom window lattice paned  lead framework  three separate windows  one swinging on hinge  and large enough to admit a man exactly  and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be partly invisible  the man might have effected his entrance there  left traces as he passed through the bedroom  and finally  finding the door open  have escaped that way holmes shook his head impatiently let us be practical  said he  i understand you to say that there are three students who use this stair  and are in the habit of passing your door yes  there are and they are all in for this examination yes have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the others soames hesitated it is a very delicate question  said he  one hardly likes to throw suspicion where there are no proofs let us hear the suspicions  i will look after the proofs i will tell you  then  in a few words the character of the three men who inhabit these rooms  the lower of the three is gilchrist  a fine scholar and athlete  plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for the college  and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump  he is a fine  manly fellow  his father was the notorious sir jabez gilchrist who ruined himself on the turf  my scholar has been left very poor  but he is hard working and industrious  he will do well the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras  the indian  he is a quiet inscrutable fellow  as most of those indians are  he is well up in his work  though his greek is his weak subject  he is steady and methodical the top floor belongs to miles mclaren  he is a brilliant fellow when he chooses to work one of the brightest intellects of the university but he is wayward  dissipated  and unprincipled  he was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year  he has been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to the examination then it is he whom you suspect i dare not go so far as that  but  of the three  he is perhaps the least unlikely exactly  now  mr  soames  let us have a look at your servant bannister he was a little  white faced  clean shaven  grizzly haired fellow of fifty  he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the quiet routine of his life  his plump face was twitching with his nervousness and his fingers could not keep still we are investigating this unhappy business  bannister  said his master yes  sir i understand  said holmes  that you left your key in the door yes  sir was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very day when there were these papers inside it was most unfortunate  sir  but i have occasionally done the same thing at other times when did you enter the room it was about half past four  that is mr  soames  tea time how long did you stay when i saw that he was absent  i withdrew at once did you look at these papers on the table no  sir certainly not how came you to leave the key in the door i had the tea tray in my hand  i thought i would come back for the key then i forgot has the outer door a spring lock no  sir then it was open all the time yes  sir anyone in the room could get out yes  sir when mr  soames returned and called for you  you were very much disturbed yes  sir  such a thing has never happened during the many years that i have been here  i nearly fainted  sir so i understand  where were you when you began to feel bad where was i  sir  why  here  near the door that is singular  because you sat down in that chair over yonder near the corner  why did you pass these other chairs i don t know  sir  it didn t matter to me where i sat i really don t think he knew much about it  mr  holmes  he was looking very bad quite ghastly you stayed here when your master left only for a minute or so  then i locked the door and went to my room whom do you suspect oh  i would not venture to say  sir  i don t believe there is any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an action  no  sir  i ll not believe it thank you  that will do  said holmes  oh  one more word  you have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that anything is amiss no  sir not a word you haven t seen any of them no  sir very good  now  mr  soames  we will take a walk in the quadrangle  if you please three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom your three birds are all in their nests  said holmes  looking up halloa  what s that  one of them seems restless enough it was the indian  whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his blind  he was pacing swiftly up and down his room i should like to have a peep at each of them  said holmes  is it possible no difficulty in the world  soames answered  this set of rooms is quite the oldest in the college  and it is not unusual for visitors to go over them  come along  and i will personally conduct you no names  please  said holmes  as we knocked at gilchrist s door  a tall  flaxen haired  slim young fellow opened it  and made us welcome when he understood our errand  there were some really curious pieces of mediaeval domestic architecture within  holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on drawing it in his notebook  broke his pencil  had to borrow one from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own  the same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the indian a silent  little  hook nosed fellow  who eyed us askance and was obviously glad when holmes s architectural studies had come to an end  i could not see that in either case holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching  only at the third did our visit prove abortive  the outer door would not open to our knock  and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad language came from behind it  i don t care who you are  you can go to blazes  roared the angry voice tomorrow s the exam  and i won t be drawn by anyone a rude fellow  said our guide  flushing with anger as we withdrew down the stair  of course  he did not realize that it was i who was knocking  but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous  and indeed  under the circumstances rather suspicious holmes s response was a curious one can you tell me his exact height  he asked really  mr  holmes  i cannot undertake to say  he is taller than the indian  not so tall as gilchrist  i suppose five foot six would be about it that is very important  said holmes  and now  mr  soames  i wish you good night our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay  good gracious mr  holmes  you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt fashion you don t seem to realize the position  to morrow is the examination  i must take some definite action to night  i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been tampered with  the situation must be faced you must leave it as it is  i shall drop round early to morrow morning and chat the matter over  it is possible that i may be in a position then to indicate some course of action  meanwhile  you change nothing nothing at all very good  mr  holmes you can be perfectly easy in your mind  we shall certainly find some way out of your difficulties  i will take the black clay with me  also the pencil cuttings  good bye when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle  we again looked up at the windows  the indian still paced his room  the others were invisible well  watson  what do you think of it  holmes asked  as we came out into the main street  quite a little parlour game sort of three card trick  is it not  there are your three men  it must be one of them  you take your choice  which is yours the foul mouthed fellow at the top  he is the one with the worst record  and yet that indian was a sly fellow also  why should he be pacing his room all the time there is nothing in that  many men do it when they are trying to learn anything by heart he looked at us in a queer way so would you  if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were preparing for an examination next day  and every moment was of value  no  i see nothing in that  pencils  too  and knives all was satisfactory  but that fellow does puzzle me who why  bannister  the servant  what s his game in the matter he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man so he did me  that s the puzzling part  why should a perfectly honest man well  well  here s a large stationer s  we shall begin our researches here there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town  and at each holmes produced his pencil chips  and bid high for a duplicate  all were agreed that one could be ordered  but that it was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock  my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure  but shrugged his shoulders in half humorous resignation no good  my dear watson  this  the best and only final clue  has run to nothing  but  indeed  i have little doubt that we can build up a sufficient case without it  by jove  my dear fellow  it is nearly nine and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven thirty  what with your eternal tobacco  watson  and your irregularity at meals  i expect that you will get notice to quit  and that i shall share your downfall not however  before we have solved the problem of the nervous tutor  the careless servant  and the three enterprising students holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day  though he sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner  at eight in the morning  he came into my room just as i finished my toilet well  watson  said he  it is time we went down to st  luke s  can you do without breakfast certainly soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him something positive have you anything positive to tell him i think so you have formed a conclusion yes  my dear watson  i have solved the mystery but what fresh evidence could you have got aha  it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at the untimely hour of six  i have put in two hours  hard work and covered at least five miles  with something to show for it  look at that he held out his hand  on the palm were three little pyramids of black doughy clay why  holmes  you had only two yesterday and one more this morning  it is a fair argument that wherever no  came from is also the source of nos   and  eh  watson  well  come along and put friend soames out of his pain the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation when we found him in his chambers  in a few hours the examination would commence  and he was still in the dilemma between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable scholarship he could hardly stand still so great was his mental agitation  and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands outstretched thank heaven that you have come  i feared that you had given it up in despair  what am i to do  shall the examination proceed yes  let it proceed  by all means but this rascal he shall not compete you know him i think so  if this matter is not to become public  we must give ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small private court martial  you there  if you please  soames  watson you here  i ll take the armchair in the middle  i think that we are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast  kindly ring the bell bannister entered  and shrank back in evident surprise and fear at our judicial appearance you will kindly close the door  said holmes  now  bannister  will you please tell us the truth about yesterday s incident the man turned white to the roots of his hair i have told you everything  sir nothing to add nothing at all  sir well  then  i must make some suggestions to you  when you sat down on that chair yesterday  did you do so in order to conceal some object which would have shown who had been in the room bannister s face was ghastly no  sir  certainly not it is only a suggestion  said holmes  suavely  i frankly admit that i am unable to prove it  but it seems probable enough  since the moment that mr  soames s back was turned  you released the man who was hiding in that bedroom bannister licked his dry lips there was no man  sir ah  that s a pity  bannister  up to now you may have spoken the truth but now i know that you have lied the man s face set in sullen defiance there was no man  sir come  come  bannister no  sir  there was no one in that case  you can give us no further information  would you please remain in the room  stand over there near the bedroom door  now  soames i am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go up to the room of young gilchrist  and to ask him to step down into yours an instant later the tutor returned  bringing with him the student  he was a fine figure of a man  tall  lithe  and agile  with a springy step and a pleasant  open face  his troubled blue eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner just close the door  said holmes  now  mr  gilchrist  we are all quite alone here  and no one need ever know one word of what passes between us  we can be perfectly frank with each other  we want to know mr  gilchrist  how you  an honourable man  ever came to commit such an action as that of yesterday the unfortunate young man staggered back  and cast a look full of horror and reproach at bannister no  no  mr  gilchrist  sir  i never said a word never one word  cried the servant no  but you have now  said holmes  now  sir  you must see that after bannister s words your position is hopeless  and that your only chance lies in a frank confession for a moment gilchrist  with upraised hand  tried to control his writhing features  the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside the table  and burying his face in his hands  he had burst into a storm of passionate sobbing come  come  said holmes  kindly  it is human to err  and at least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal  perhaps it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr  soames what occurred  and you can check me where i am wrong  shall i do so  well  well  don t trouble to answer  listen  and see that i do you no injustice from the moment  mr  soames  that you said to me that no one  not even bannister  could have told that the papers were in your room  the case began to take a definite shape in my mind  the printer one could  of course  dismiss  he could examine the papers in his own office  the indian i also thought nothing of  if the proofs were in a roll  he could not possibly know what they were  on the other hand  it seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the table  i dismissed that  the man who entered knew that the papers were there  how did he know when i approached your room  i examined the window  you amused me by supposing that i was contemplating the possibility of someone having in broad daylight  under the eyes of all these opposite rooms  forced himself through it  such an idea was absurd  i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order to see  as he passed  what papers were on the central table  i am six feet high  and i could do it with an effort no one less than that would have a chance  already you see i had reason to think that  if one of your three students was a man of unusual height  he was the most worth watching of the three i entered  and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of the side table  of the centre table i could make nothing  until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a long distance jumper  then the whole thing came to me in an instant  and i only needed certain corroborative proofs  which i speedily obtained what happened with sic  this  this young fellow had employed his afternoon at the athletic grounds  where he had been practising the jump  he returned carrying his jumping shoes  which are provided  as you are aware  with several sharp spikes  as he passed your window he saw  by means of his great height  these proofs upon your table  and conjectured what they were  no harm would have been done had it not been that  as he passed your door  he perceived the key which had been left by the carelessness of your servant  a sudden impulse came over him to enter  and see if they were indeed the proofs  it was not a dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply looked in to ask a question well  when he saw that they were indeed the proofs  it was then that he yielded to temptation  he put his shoes on the table  what was it you put on that chair near the window gloves  said the young man holmes looked triumphantly at bannister  he put his gloves on the chair  and he took the proofs  sheet by sheet  to copy them  he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he would see him  as we know  he came back by the side gate  suddenly he heard him at the very door  there was no possible escape  he forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom  you observe that the scratch on that table is slight at one side  but deepens in the direction of the bedroom door  that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction  and that the culprit had taken refuge there the earth round the spike had been left on the table  and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom  i may add that i walked out to the athletic grounds this morning  saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping pit and carried away a specimen of it  together with some of the fine tan or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from slipping  have i told the truth  mr  gilchrist the student had drawn himself erect yes  sir  it is true  said he good heavens  have you nothing to add  cried soames yes  sir  i have  but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has bewildered me  i have a letter here  mr  soames  which i wrote to you early this morning in the middle of a restless night  it was before i knew that my sin had found me out  here it is  sir  you will see that i have said  i have determined not to go in for the examination  i have been offered a commission in the rhodesian police  and i am going out to south africa at once i am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by your unfair advantage  said soames  but why did you change your purpose gilchrist pointed to bannister there is the man who set me in the right path  said he come now  bannister  said holmes  it will be clear to you  from what i have said  that only you could have let this young man out  since you were left in the room  and must have locked the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window  it was incredible  can you not clear up the last point in this mystery  and tell us the reasons for your action it was simple enough  sir  if you only had known  but  with all your cleverness  it was impossible that you could know  time was  sir  when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist  this young gentleman s father when he was ruined i came to the college as servant  but i never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world  i watched his son all i could for the sake of the old days  well  sir  when i came into this room yesterday  when the alarm was given  the very first thing i saw was mr  gilchrist s tan gloves a lying in that chair  i knew those gloves well  and i understood their message  if mr  soames saw them  the game was up  i flopped down into that chair  and nothing would budge me until mr  soames he went for you  then out came my poor young master  whom i had dandled on my knee  and confessed it all to me  wasn t it natural sir  that i should save him  and wasn t it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead father would have done  and make him understand that he could not profit by such a deed  could you blame me sir no  indeed  said holmes  heartily  springing to his feet  well soames  i think we have cleared your little problem up  and our breakfast awaits us at home  come  watson  as to you  sir  i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia  for once you have fallen low let us see  in the future  how high you can rise the adventure of the golden pince nez when i look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain our work for the year  i confess that it is very difficult for me out of such a wealth of material  to select the cases which are most interesting in themselves  and at the same time most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my friend was famous  as i turn over the pages  i see my notes upon the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of crosby  the banker  here also i find an account of the addleton tragedy  and the singular contents of the ancient british barrow  the famous smith mortimer succession case comes also within this period  and so does the tracking and arrest of huret the boulevard assassin an exploit which won for holmes an autograph letter of thanks from the french president and the order of the legion of honour  each of these would furnish a narrative  but on the whole i am of opinion that none of them unites so many singular points of interest as the episode of yoxley old place  which includes not only the lamentable death of young willoughby smith  but also those subsequent developments which threw so curious a light upon the causes of the crime it was a wild  tempestuous night  towards the close of november holmes and i sat together in silence all the evening  he engaged with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original inscription upon a palimpsest  i deep in a recent treatise upon surgery  outside the wind howled down baker street  while the rain beat fiercely against the windows  it was strange there  in the very depths of the town  with ten miles of man s handiwork on every side of us  to feel the iron grip of nature  and to be conscious that to the huge elemental forces all london was no more than the molehills that dot the fields  i walked to the window  and looked out on the deserted street  the occasional lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement  a single cab was splashing its way from the oxford street end well  watson  it s as well we have not to turn out to night  said holmes  laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest  i ve done enough for one sitting  it is trying work for the eyes  so far as i can make out  it is nothing more exciting than an abbey s accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth century  halloa  halloa  halloa what s this amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a horse s hoofs  and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against the curb  the cab which i had seen had pulled up at our door what can he want  i ejaculated  as a man stepped out of it want  he wants us  and we  my poor watson  want overcoats and cravats and goloshes  and every aid that man ever invented to fight the weather wait a bit  though  there s the cab off again  there s hope yet  he d have kept it if he had wanted us to come  run down  my dear fellow  and open the door  for all virtuous folk have been long in bed when the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor  i had no difficulty in recognizing him  it was young stanley hopkins  a promising detective  in whose career holmes had several times shown a very practical interest is he in  he asked  eagerly come up  my dear sir  said holmes s voice from above  i hope you have no designs upon us such a night as this the detective mounted the stairs  and our lamp gleamed upon his shining waterproof  i helped him out of it  while holmes knocked a blaze out of the logs in the grate now  my dear hopkins  draw up and warm your toes  said he  here s a cigar  and the doctor has a prescription containing hot water and a lemon  which is good medicine on a night like this  it must be something important which has brought you out in such a gale it is indeed  mr  holmes  i ve had a bustling afternoon  i promise you did you see anything of the yoxley case in the latest editions i ve seen nothing later than the fifteenth century to day well  it was only a paragraph  and all wrong at that  so you have not missed anything  i haven t let the grass grow under my feet  it s down in kent  seven miles from chatham and three from the railway line  i was wired for at  reached yoxley old place at  conducted my investigation  was back at charing cross by the last train  and straight to you by cab which means  i suppose  that you are not quite clear about your case it means that i can make neither head nor tail of it  so far as i can see  it is just as tangled a business as ever i handled  and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldn t go wrong  there s no motive mr  holmes  that s what bothers me i can t put my hand on a motive here s a man dead there s no denying that but  so far as i can see  no reason on earth why anyone should wish him harm holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair let us hear about it  said he i ve got my facts pretty clear  said stanley hopkins  all i want now is to know what they all mean  the story  so far as i can make it out is like this  some years ago this country house  yoxley old place  was taken by an elderly man  who gave the name of professor coram  he was an invalid  keeping his bed half the time  and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath chair  he was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him  and he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man  his household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper mrs  marker  and of a maid  susan tarlton  these have both been with him since his arrival  and they seem to be women of excellent character  the professor is writing a learned book  and he found it necessary  about a year ago  to engage a secretary  the first two that he tried were not successes  but the third  mr  willoughby smith  a very young man straight from the university  seems to have been just what his employer wanted  his work consisted in writing all the morning to the professor s dictation  and he usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages which bore upon the next day s work  this willoughby smith has nothing against him  either as a boy at uppingham or as a young man at cambridge  i have seen his testimonials  and from the first he was a decent  quiet  hard working fellow  with no weak spot in him at all and yet this is the lad who has met his death this morning in the professor s study under circumstances which can point only to murder the wind howled and screamed at the windows  holmes and i drew closer to the fire  while the young inspector slowly and point by point developed his singular narrative if you were to search all england  said he  i don t suppose you could find a household more self contained or freer from outside influences whole weeks would pass  and not one of them go past the garden gate the professor was buried in his work and existed for nothing else young smith knew nobody in the neighbourhood  and lived very much as his employer did  the two women had nothing to take them from the house  mortimer  the gardener  who wheels the bath chair  is an army pensioner an old crimean man of excellent character  he does not live in the house  but in a three roomed cottage at the other end of the garden  those are the only people that you would find within the grounds of yoxley old place  at the same time  the gate of the garden is a hundred yards from the main london to chatham road  it opens with a latch  and there is nothing to prevent anyone from walking in now i will give you the evidence of susan tarlton  who is the only person who can say anything positive about the matter  it was in the forenoon  between eleven and twelve  she was engaged at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front bedroom  professor coram was still in bed  for when the weather is bad he seldom rises before midday the housekeeper was busied with some work in the back of the house  willoughby smith had been in his bedroom  which he uses as a sitting room  but the maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend to the study immediately below her  she did not see him  but she says that she could not be mistaken in his quick  firm tread  she did not hear the study door close  but a minute or so later there was a dreadful cry in the room below  it was a wild  hoarse scream  so strange and unnatural that it might have come either from a man or a woman  at the same instant there was a heavy thud  which shook the old house  and then all was silence  the maid stood petrified for a moment  and then  recovering her courage  she ran downstairs  the study door was shut and she opened it  inside  young mr  willoughby smith was stretched upon the floor  at first she could see no injury  but as she tried to raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of his neck  it was pierced by a very small but very deep wound  which had divided the carotid artery  the instrument with which the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him  it was one of those small sealing wax knives to be found on old fashioned writing tables  with an ivory handle and a stiff blade  it was part of the fittings of the professor s own desk at first the maid thought that young smith was already dead  but on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened his eyes for an instant  the professor  he murmured it was she  the maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact words  he tried desperately to say something else  and he held his right hand up in the air  then he fell back dead in the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene  but she was just too late to catch the young man s dying words  leaving susan with the body  she hurried to the professor s room  he was sitting up in bed  horribly agitated  for he had heard enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred  mrs  marker is prepared to swear that the professor was still in his night clothes  and indeed it was impossible for him to dress without the help of mortimer  whose orders were to come at twelve o clock  the professor declares that he heard the distant cry  but that he knows nothing more  he can give no explanation of the young man s last words  the professor it was she  but imagines that they were the outcome of delirium  he believes that willoughby smith had not an enemy in the world  and can give no reason for the crime  his first action was to send mortimer  the gardener  for the local police  a little later the chief constable sent for me  nothing was moved before i got there  and strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths leading to the house  it was a splendid chance of putting your theories into practice  mr  sherlock holmes there was really nothing wanting except mr  sherlock holmes  said my companion  with a somewhat bitter smile  well  let us hear about it  what sort of a job did you make of it i must ask you first  mr  holmes  to glance at this rough plan  which will give you a general idea of the position of the professor s study and the various points of the case  it will help you in following my investigation he unfolded the rough chart  which i here reproduce graphic and he laid it across holmes s knee  i rose and  standing behind holmes studied it over his shoulder it is very rough  of course  and it only deals with the points which seem to me to be essential  all the rest you will see later for yourself  now  first of all  presuming that the assassin entered the house  how did he or she come in  undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door  from which there is direct access to the study  any other way would have been exceedingly complicated  the escape must have also been made along that line  for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by susan as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the professor s bedroom  i therefore directed my attention at once to the garden path  which was saturated with recent rain  and would certainly show any footmarks my examination showed me that i was dealing with a cautious and expert criminal  no footmarks were to be found on the path  there could be no question  however  that someone had passed along the grass border which lines the path  and that he had done so in order to avoid leaving a track  i could not find anything in the nature of a distinct impression but the grass was trodden down  and someone had undoubtedly passed  it could only have been the murderer  since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been there that morning  and the rain had only begun during the night one moment  said holmes  where does this path lead to to the road how long is it a hundred yards or so at the point where the path passes through the gate  you could surely pick up the tracks unfortunately  the path was tiled at that point well  on the road itself no  it was all trodden into mire tut tut  well  then  these tracks upon the grass  were they coming or going it was impossible to say  there was never any outline a large foot or a small you could not distinguish holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience it has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since  said he  it will be harder to read now than that palimpsest  well  well  it can t be helped  what did you do  hopkins  after you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing i think i made certain of a good deal  mr  holmes  i knew that someone had entered the house cautiously from without  i next examined the corridor  it is lined with cocoanut matting and had taken no impression of any kind  this brought me into the study itself  it is a scantily furnished room  the main article is a large writing table with a fixed bureau  this bureau consists of a double column of drawers  with a central small cupboard between them  the drawers were open  the cupboard locked  the drawers  it seems  were always open  and nothing of value was kept in them  there were some papers of importance in the cupboard but there were no signs that this had been tampered with  and the professor assures me that nothing was missing  it is certain that no robbery has been committed i come now to the body of the young man  it was found near the bureau and just to the left of it  as marked upon that chart  the stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind forward  so that it is almost impossible that it could have been self inflicted unless he fell upon the knife  said holmes exactly  the idea crossed my mind  but we found the knife some feet away from the body  so that seems impossible  then  of course  there are the man s own dying words  and  finally  there was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped in the dead man s right hand from his pocket stanley hopkins drew a small paper packet  he unfolded it and disclosed a golden pince nez  with two broken ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it  willoughby smith had excellent sight  he added  there can be no question that this was snatched from the face or the person of the assassin sherlock holmes took the glasses into his hand  and examined them with the utmost attention and interest  he held them on his nose  endeavoured to read through them  went to the window and stared up the street with them  looked at them most minutely in the full light of the lamp  and finally  with a chuckle  seated himself at the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper  which he tossed across to stanley hopkins that s the best i can do for you  said he  it may prove to be of some use the astonished detective read the note aloud  it ran as follows wanted  a woman of good address  attired like a lady  she has a remarkably thick nose  with eyes which are set close upon either side of it  she has a puckered forehead  a peering expression  and probably rounded shoulders  there are indications that she has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last few months  as her glasses are of remarkable strength  and as opticians are not very numerous  there should be no difficulty in tracing her holmes smiled at the astonishment of hopkins  which must have been reflected upon my features  surely my deductions are simplicity itself  said he  it would be difficult to name any articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of glasses  especially so remarkable a pair as these  that they belong to a woman i infer from their delicacy  and also  of course  from the last words of the dying man  as to her being a person of refinement and well dressed  they are  as you perceive  handsomely mounted in solid gold  and it is inconceivable that anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other respects  you will find that the clips are too wide for your nose showing that the lady s nose was very broad at the base  this sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one  but there is a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description  my own face is a narrow one  and yet i find that i cannot get my eyes into the centre  nor near the centre  of these glasses  therefore  the lady s eyes are set very near to the sides of the nose  you will perceive  watson  that the glasses are concave and of unusual strength  a lady whose vision has been so extremely contracted all her life is sure to have the physical characteristics of such vision  which are seen in the forehead  the eyelids  and the shoulders yes  i said  i can follow each of your arguments  i confess  however that i am unable to understand how you arrive at the double visit to the optician holmes took the glasses in his hand you will perceive  he said  that the clips are lined with tiny bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose  one of these is discoloured and worn to some slight extent  but the other is new evidently one has fallen off and been replaced  i should judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few months  they exactly correspond  so i gather that the lady went back to the same establishment for the second by george  it s marvellous  cried hopkins  in an ecstasy of admiration  to think that i had all that evidence in my hand and never knew it  i had intended  however  to go the round of the london opticians of course you would  meanwhile  have you anything more to tell us about the case nothing  mr  holmes  i think that you know as much as i do now probably more  we have had inquiries made as to any stranger seen on the country roads or at the railway station  we have heard of none what beats me is the utter want of all object in the crime  not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest ah  there i am not in a position to help you  but i suppose you want us to come out to morrow if it is not asking too much  mr  holmes  there s a train from charing cross to chatham at six in the morning  and we should be at yoxley old place between eight and nine then we shall take it  your case has certainly some features of great interest  and i shall be delighted to look into it  well  it s nearly one  and we had best get a few hours  sleep  i daresay you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the fire  i ll light my spirit lamp and give you a cup of coffee before we start the gale had blown itself out next day  but it was a bitter morning when we started upon our journey  we saw the cold winter sun rise over the dreary marshes of the thames and the long  sullen reaches of the river which i shall ever associate with our pursuit of the andaman islander in the earlier days of our career  after a long and weary journey  we alighted at a small station some miles from chatham  while a horse was being put into a trap at the local inn  we snatched a hurried breakfast and so we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at yoxley old place  a constable met us at the garden gate well  wilson  any news no  sir nothing no reports of any stranger seen no  sir  down at the station they are certain that no stranger either came or went yesterday have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings yes  sir  there is no one that we cannot account for well  it s only a reasonable walk to chatham  anyone might stay there or take a train without being observed  this is the garden path of which i spoke  mr  holmes  i ll pledge my word there was no mark on it yesterday on which side were the marks on the grass this side  sir  this narrow margin of grass between the path and the flower bed  i can t see the traces now  but they were clear to me then yes  yes  someone has passed along  said holmes  stooping over the grass border  our lady must have picked her steps carefully  must she not  since on the one side she would leave a track on the path  and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed yes  sir  she must have been a cool hand i saw an intent look pass over holmes s face you say that she must have come back this way yes  sir  there is no other on this strip of grass certainly  mr  holmes hum  it was a very remarkable performance very remarkable  well  i think we have exhausted the path  let us go farther  this garden door is usually kept open  i suppose  then this visitor had nothing to do but to walk in  the idea of murder was not in her mind  or she would have provided herself with some sort of weapon  instead of having to pick this knife off the writing table  she advanced along this corridor leaving no traces upon the cocoanut matting  then she found herself in this study  how long was she there  we have no means of judging not more than a few minutes  sir  i forgot to tell you that mrs marker  the housekeeper  had been in there tidying not very long before about a quarter of an hour  she says well  that gives us a limit  our lady enters this room  and what does she do  she goes over to the writing table  what for  not for anything in the drawers  if there had been anything worth her taking  it would surely have been locked up  no  it was for something in that wooden bureau  halloa  what is that scratch upon the face of it  just hold a match  watson  why did you not tell me of this  hopkins the mark which he was examining began upon the brass work on the right hand side of the keyhole  and extended for about four inches where it had scratched the varnish from the surface i noticed it  mr  holmes  but you ll always find scratches round a keyhole this is recent  quite recent  see how the brass shines where it is cut  an old scratch would be the same colour as the surface  look at it through my lens  there s the varnish  too  like earth on each side of a furrow  is mrs  marker there a sad faced  elderly woman came into the room did you dust this bureau yesterday morning yes  sir did you notice this scratch no  sir  i did not i am sure you did not  for a duster would have swept away these shreds of varnish  who has the key of this bureau the professor keeps it on his watch chain is it a simple key no  sir  it is a chubb s key very good  mrs  marker  you can go  now we are making a little progress  our lady enters the room  advances to the bureau  and either opens it or tries to do so  while she is thus engaged  young willoughby smith enters the room  in her hurry to withdraw the key  she makes this scratch upon the door  he seizes her  and she  snatching up the nearest object  which happens to be this knife  strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold  the blow is a fatal one  he falls and she escapes either with or without the object for which she has come  is susan  the maid  there  could anyone have got away through that door after the time that you heard the cry  susan no sir  it is impossible  before i got down the stair  i d have seen anyone in the passage  besides  the door never opened  or i would have heard it that settles this exit  then no doubt the lady went out the way she came  i understand that this other passage leads only to the professor s room  there is no exit that way no  sir we shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor  halloa hopkins  this is very important  very important indeed  the professor s corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting well  sir  what of that don t you see any bearing upon the case  well  well  i don t insist upon it  no doubt i am wrong  and yet it seems to me to be suggestive come with me and introduce me we passed down the passage  which was of the same length as that which led to the garden  at the end was a short flight of steps ending in a door  our guide knocked  and then ushered us into the professor s bedroom it was a very large chamber  lined with innumerable volumes  which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the corners  or were stacked all round at the base of the cases  the bed was in the centre of the room  and in it  propped up with pillows  was the owner of the house  i have seldom seen a more remarkable looking person  it was a gaunt  aquiline face which was turned towards us  with piercing dark eyes  which lurked in deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows  his hair and beard were white  save that the latter was curiously stained with yellow around his mouth  a cigarette glowed amid the tangle of white hair  and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco smoke as he held out his hand to holmes  i perceived that it was also stained with yellow nicotine a smoker  mr  holmes  said he  speaking in well chosen english  with a curious little mincing accent  pray take a cigarette  and you  sir i can recommend them  for i have them especially prepared by ionides  of alexandria  he sends me a thousand at a time  and i grieve to say that i have to arrange for a fresh supply every fortnight  bad  sir  very bad but an old man has few pleasures  tobacco and my work that is all that is left to me holmes had lit a cigarette and was shooting little darting glances all over the room tobacco and my work  but now only tobacco  the old man exclaimed alas  what a fatal interruption  who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe  so estimable a young man  i assure you that  after a few months  training  he was an admirable assistant  what do you think of the matter  mr  holmes i have not yet made up my mind i shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where all is so dark to us  to a poor bookworm and invalid like myself such a blow is paralyzing  i seem to have lost the faculty of thought  but you are a man of action you are a man of affairs  it is part of the everyday routine of your life  you can preserve your balance in every emergency we are fortunate  indeed  in having you at our side holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old professor was talking  i observed that he was smoking with extraordinary rapidity  it was evident that he shared our host s liking for the fresh alexandrian cigarettes yes  sir  it is a crushing blow  said the old man  that is my magnum opus the pile of papers on the side table yonder  it is my analysis of the documents found in the coptic monasteries of syria and egypt  a work which will cut deep at the very foundation of revealed religion  with my enfeebled health i do not know whether i shall ever be able to complete it  now that my assistant has been taken from me  dear me  mr  holmes why  you are even a quicker smoker than i am myself holmes smiled i am a connoisseur  said he  taking another cigarette from the box his fourth and lighting it from the stub of that which he had finished  i will not trouble you with any lengthy cross examination professor coram  since i gather that you were in bed at the time of the crime  and could know nothing about it  i would only ask this  what do you imagine that this poor fellow meant by his last words  the professor it was she the professor shook his head susan is a country girl  said he  and you know the incredible stupidity of that class  i fancy that the poor fellow murmured some incoherent delirious words  and that she twisted them into this meaningless message i see  you have no explanation yourself of the tragedy possibly an accident  possibly i only breathe it among ourselves a suicide  young men have their hidden troubles some affair of the heart perhaps  which we have never known  it is a more probable supposition than murder but the eyeglasses ah  i am only a student a man of dreams  i cannot explain the practical things of life  but still  we are aware  my friend  that love gages may take strange shapes  by all means take another cigarette it is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them so  a fan  a glove glasses who knows what article may be carried as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life  this gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass  but  after all  it is easy to be mistaken on such a point as to the knife  it might well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell  it is possible that i speak as a child  but to me it seems that willoughby smith has met his fate by his own hand holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward  and he continued to walk up and down for some time  lost in thought and consuming cigarette after cigarette tell me  professor coram  he said  at last  what is in that cupboard in the bureau nothing that would help a thief  family papers  letters from my poor wife  diplomas of universities which have done me honour  here is the key  you can look for yourself holmes picked up the key  and looked at it for an instant  then he handed it back no  i hardly think that it would help me  said he  i should prefer to go quietly down to your garden  and turn the whole matter over in my head  there is something to be said for the theory of suicide which you have put forward  we must apologize for having intruded upon you professor coram  and i promise that we won t disturb you until after lunch  at two o clock we will come again  and report to you anything which may have happened in the interval holmes was curiously distrait  and we walked up and down the garden path for some time in silence have you a clue  i asked  at last it depends upon those cigarettes that i smoked  said he  it is possible that i am utterly mistaken  the cigarettes will show me my dear holmes  i exclaimed  how on earth well  well  you may see for yourself  if not  there s no harm done  of course  we always have the optician clue to fall back upon  but i take a short cut when i can get it  ah  here is the good mrs  marker  let us enjoy five minutes of instructive conversation with her i may have remarked before that holmes had  when he liked  a peculiarly ingratiating way with women  and that he very readily established terms of confidence with them  in half the time which he had named  he had captured the housekeeper s goodwill and was chatting with her as if he had known her for years yes  mr  holmes  it is as you say  sir  he does smoke something terrible  all day and sometimes all night  sir  i ve seen that room of a morning well  sir  you d have thought it was a london fog  poor young mr  smith  he was a smoker also  but not as bad as the professor  his health well  i don t know that it s better nor worse for the smoking ah  said holmes  but it kills the appetite well  i don t know about that  sir i suppose the professor eats hardly anything well  he is variable  i ll say that for him i ll wager he took no breakfast this morning  and won t face his lunch after all the cigarettes i saw him consume well  you re out there  sir  as it happens  for he ate a remarkable big breakfast this morning  i don t know when i ve known him make a better one  and he s ordered a good dish of cutlets for his lunch  i m surprised myself  for since i came into that room yesterday and saw young mr  smith lying there on the floor  i couldn t bear to look at food  well  it takes all sorts to make a world  and the professor hasn t let it take his appetite away we loitered the morning away in the garden  stanley hopkins had gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange woman who had been seen by some children on the chatham road the previous morning  as to my friend  all his usual energy seemed to have deserted him  i had never known him handle a case in such a half hearted fashion  even the news brought back by hopkins that he had found the children  and that they had undoubtedly seen a woman exactly corresponding with holmes s description  and wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses  failed to rouse any sign of keen interest  he was more attentive when susan  who waited upon us at lunch  volunteered the information that she believed mr  smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning  and that he had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred  i could not myself see the bearing of this incident  but i clearly perceived that holmes was weaving it into the general scheme which he had formed in his brain  suddenly he sprang from his chair and glanced at his watch  two o clock  gentlemen  said he  we must go up and have it out with our friend  the professor the old man had just finished his lunch  and certainly his empty dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his housekeeper had credited him  he was  indeed  a weird figure as he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us  the eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth  he had been dressed and was seated in an armchair by the fire well  mr  holmes  have you solved this mystery yet  he shoved the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him towards my companion  holmes stretched out his hand at the same moment  and between them they tipped the box over the edge  for a minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray cigarettes from impossible places  when we rose again  i observed holmes s eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour  only at a crisis have i seen those battle signals flying yes  said he  i have solved it stanley hopkins and i stared in amazement  something like a sneer quivered over the gaunt features of the old professor indeed  in the garden no  here here  when this instant you are surely joking  mr  sherlock holmes  you compel me to tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such a fashion i have forged and tested every link of my chain  professor coram  and i am sure that it is sound  what your motives are  or what exact part you play in this strange business  i am not yet able to say  in a few minutes i shall probably hear it from your own lips  meanwhile i will reconstruct what is past for your benefit  so that you may know the information which i still require a lady yesterday entered your study  she came with the intention of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your bureau  she had a key of her own  i have had an opportunity of examining yours  and i do not find that slight discolouration which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced  you were not an accessory  therefore  and she came  so far as i can read the evidence  without your knowledge to rob you the professor blew a cloud from his lips  this is most interesting and instructive  said he  have you no more to add  surely  having traced this lady so far  you can also say what has become of her i will endeavour to do so  in the first place she was seized by your secretary  and stabbed him in order to escape  this catastrophe i am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident  for i am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so grievous an injury  an assassin does not come unarmed  horrified by what she had done  she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy  unfortunately for her  she had lost her glasses in the scuffle  and as she was extremely short sighted she was really helpless without them  she ran down a corridor  which she imagined to be that by which she had come both were lined with cocoanut matting and it was only when it was too late that she understood that she had taken the wrong passage  and that her retreat was cut off behind her  what was she to do  she could not go back  she could not remain where she was  she must go on  she went on  she mounted a stair  pushed open a door  and found herself in your room the old man sat with his mouth open  staring wildly at holmes  amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features  now  with an effort he shrugged his shoulders and burst into insincere laughter all very fine  mr  holmes  said he  but there is one little flaw in your splendid theory  i was myself in my room  and i never left it during the day i am aware of that  professor coram and you mean to say that i could lie upon that bed and not be aware that a woman had entered my room i never said so  you were aware of it  you spoke with her  you recognized her  you aided her to escape again the professor burst into high keyed laughter  he had risen to his feet  and his eyes glowed like embers you are mad  he cried  you are talking insanely  i helped her to escape  where is she now she is there  said holmes  and he pointed to a high bookcase in the corner of the room i saw the old man throw up his arms  a terrible convulsion passed over his grim face  and he fell back in his chair  at the same instant the bookcase at which holmes pointed swung round upon a hinge  and a woman rushed out into the room  you are right  she cried  in a strange foreign voice  you are right  i am here she was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had come from the walls of her hiding place  her face  too  was streaked with grime  and at the best she could never have been handsome  for she had the exact physical characteristics which holmes had divined  with  in addition  a long and obstinate chin  what with her natural blindness and what with the change from dark to light  she stood as one dazed blinking about her to see where and who we were  and yet  in spite of all these disadvantages  there was a certain nobility in the woman s bearing a gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head  which compelled something of respect and admiration stanley hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as his prisoner  but she waved him aside gently  and yet with an over mastering dignity which compelled obedience  the old man lay back in his chair with a twitching face  and stared at her with brooding eyes yes  sir  i am your prisoner  she said  from where i stood i could hear everything  and i know that you have learned the truth  i confess it all  it was i who killed the young man  but you are right you who say it was an accident  i did not even know that it was a knife which i held in my hand  for in my despair i snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him let me go  it is the truth that i tell madam  said holmes  i am sure that it is the truth  i fear that you are far from well she had turned a dreadful colour  the more ghastly under the dark dust streaks upon her face  she seated herself on the side of the bed then she resumed i have only a little time here  she said  but i would have you to know the whole truth  i am this man s wife  he is not an englishman  he is a russian  his name i will not tell for the first time the old man stirred  god bless you  anna  he cried god bless you she cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction  why should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours  sergius  said she  it has done harm to many and good to none not even to yourself  however it is not for me to cause the frail thread to be snapped before god s time  i have enough already upon my soul since i crossed the threshold of this cursed house  but i must speak or i shall be too late i have said  gentlemen  that i am this man s wife  he was fifty and i a foolish girl of twenty when we married  it was in a city of russia  a university i will not name the place god bless you  anna  murmured the old man again we were reformers revolutionists nihilists  you understand  he and i and many more  then there came a time of trouble  a police officer was killed  many were arrested  evidence was wanted  and in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward  my husband betrayed his own wife and his companions  yes  we were all arrested upon his confession some of us found our way to the gallows  and some to siberia  i was among these last  but my term was not for life  my husband came to england with his ill gotten gains and has lived in quiet ever since knowing well that if the brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before justice would be done the old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a cigarette  i am in your hands  anna  said he  you were always good to me i have not yet told you the height of his villainy  said she  among our comrades of the order  there was one who was the friend of my heart he was noble  unselfish  loving all that my husband was not  he hated violence  we were all guilty if that is guilt but he was not  he wrote forever dissuading us from such a course  these letters would have saved him  so would my diary  in which  from day to day  i had entered both my feelings towards him and the view which each of us had taken  my husband found and kept both diary and letters  he hid them  and he tried hard to swear away the young man s life  in this he failed  but alexis was sent a convict to siberia  where now  at this moment  he works in a salt mine  think of that  you villain  you villain now  now  at this very moment  alexis  a man whose name you are not worthy to speak  works and lives like a slave  and yet i have your life in my hands  and i let you go you were always a noble woman  anna  said the old man  puffing at his cigarette she had risen  but she fell back again with a little cry of pain i must finish  she said  when my term was over i set myself to get the diary and letters which  if sent to the russian government  would procure my friend s release  i knew that my husband had come to england after months of searching i discovered where he was  i knew that he still had the diary  for when i was in siberia i had a letter from him once  reproaching me and quoting some passages from its pages  yet i was sure that  with his revengeful nature  he would never give it to me of his own free will  i must get it for myself  with this object i engaged an agent from a private detective firm  who entered my husband s house as a secretary it was your second secretary  sergius  the one who left you so hurriedly  he found that papers were kept in the cupboard  and he got an impression of the key  he would not go farther  he furnished me with a plan of the house  and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always empty  as the secretary was employed up here  so at last i took my courage in both hands  and i came down to get the papers for myself  i succeeded  but at what a cost i had just taken the paper  and was locking the cupboard  when the young man seized me  i had seen him already that morning  he had met me on the road  and i had asked him to tell me where professor coram lived not knowing that he was in his employ exactly  exactly  said holmes  the secretary came back  and told his employer of the woman he had met  then  in his last breath  he tried to send a message that it was she the she whom he had just discussed with him you must let me speak  said the woman  in an imperative voice  and her face contracted as if in pain  when he had fallen i rushed from the room  chose the wrong door  and found myself in my husband s room  he spoke of giving me up  i showed him that if he did so  his life was in my hands  if he gave me to the law  i could give him to the brotherhood it was not that i wished to live for my own sake  but it was that i desired to accomplish my purpose  he knew that i would do what i said that his own fate was involved in mine  for that reason  and for no other  he shielded me  he thrust me into that dark hiding place a relic of old days  known only to himself  he took his meals in his own room  and so was able to give me part of his food  it was agreed that when the police left the house i should slip away by night and come back no more  but in some way you have read our plans  she tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet  these are my last words  said she here is the packet which will save alexis  i confide it to your honour and to your love of justice  take it  you will deliver it at the russian embassy  now  i have done my duty  and stop her  cried holmes  he had bounded across the room and had wrenched a small phial from her hand too late  she said  sinking back on the bed  too late  i took the poison before i left my hiding place  my head swims  i am going  i charge you  sir  to remember the packet a simple case  and yet  in some ways  an instructive one  holmes remarked  as we travelled back to town  it hinged from the outset upon the pince nez  but for the fortunate chance of the dying man having seized these  i am not sure that we could ever have reached our solution  it was clear to me  from the strength of the glasses  that the wearer must have been very blind and helpless when deprived of them when you asked me to believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without once making a false step  i remarked  as you may remember that it was a noteworthy performance  in my mind i set it down as an impossible performance  save in the unlikely case that she had a second pair of glasses  i was forced  therefore  to consider seriously the hypothesis that she had remained within the house  on perceiving the similarity of the two corridors  it became clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake  and  in that case  it was evident that she must have entered the professor s room  i was keenly on the alert therefore  for whatever would bear out this supposition  and i examined the room narrowly for anything in the shape of a hiding place  the carpet seemed continuous and firmly nailed  so i dismissed the idea of a trap door  there might well be a recess behind the books  as you are aware  such devices are common in old libraries  i observed that books were piled on the floor at all other points  but that one bookcase was left clear  this  then  might be the door  i could see no marks to guide me  but the carpet was of a dun colour  which lends itself very well to examination  i therefore smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes  and i dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected bookcase  it was a simple trick  but exceedingly effective i then went downstairs  and i ascertained  in your presence  watson without your perceiving the drift of my remarks  that professor coram s consumption of food had increased as one would expect when he is supplying a second person  we then ascended to the room again  when by upsetting the cigarette box  i obtained a very excellent view of the floor  and was able to see quite clearly  from the traces upon the cigarette ash  that the prisoner had in our absence come out from her retreat  well  hopkins  here we are at charing cross  and i congratulate you on having brought your case to a successful conclusion  you are going to headquarters  no doubt  i think  watson  you and i will drive together to the russian embassy the adventure of the missing three quarter we were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at baker street but i have a particular recollection of one which reached us on a gloomy february morning  some seven or eight years ago  and gave mr  sherlock holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour  it was addressed to him  and ran thus please await me  terrible misfortune  right wing three quarter missing indispensable to morrow  overton strand postmark  and dispatched ten thirty six  said holmes  reading it over and over  mr  overton was evidently considerably excited when he sent it  and somewhat incoherent in consequence  well  well  he will be here  i daresay  by the time i have looked through the times  and then we shall know all about it  even the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant days things had indeed been very slow with us  and i had learned to dread such periods of inaction  for i knew by experience that my companion s brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous to leave it without material upon which to work  for years i had gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened once to check his remarkable career  now i knew that under ordinary conditions he no longer craved for this artificial stimulus  but i was well aware that the fiend was not dead but sleeping  and i have known that the sleep was a light one and the waking near when in periods of idleness i have seen the drawn look upon holmes s ascetic face  and the brooding of his deep set and inscrutable eyes  therefore i blessed this mr  overton whoever he might be  since he had come with his enigmatic message to break that dangerous calm which brought more peril to my friend than all the storms of his tempestuous life as we had expected  the telegram was soon followed by its sender  and the card of mr  cyril overton  trinity college  cambridge  announced the arrival of an enormous young man  sixteen stone of solid bone and muscle  who spanned the doorway with his broad shoulders  and looked from one of us to the other with a comely face which was haggard with anxiety mr  sherlock holmes my companion bowed i ve been down to scotland yard  mr  holmes  i saw inspector stanley hopkins  he advised me to come to you  he said the case  so far as he could see  was more in your line than in that of the regular police pray sit down and tell me what is the matter it s awful  mr  holmes simply awful i wonder my hair isn t gray godfrey staunton you ve heard of him  of course  he s simply the hinge that the whole team turns on  i d rather spare two from the pack and have godfrey for my three quarter line  whether it s passing  or tackling  or dribbling  there s no one to touch him  and then  he s got the head  and can hold us all together  what am i to do  that s what i ask you  mr  holmes  there s moorhouse  first reserve  but he is trained as a half  and he always edges right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touchline  he s a fine place kick  it s true  but then he has no judgment  and he can t sprint for nuts  why  morton or johnson  the oxford fliers  could romp round him  stevenson is fast enough  but he couldn t drop from the twenty five line  and a three quarter who can t either punt or drop isn t worth a place for pace alone  no  mr  holmes  we are done unless you can help me to find godfrey staunton my friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech  which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness  every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand upon the speaker s knee  when our visitor was silent holmes stretched out his hand and took down letter s  of his commonplace book  for once he dug in vain into that mine of varied information there is arthur h  staunton  the rising young forger  said he  and there was henry staunton  whom i helped to hang  but godfrey staunton is a new name to me it was our visitor s turn to look surprised why  mr  holmes  i thought you knew things  said he  i suppose then  if you have never heard of godfrey staunton  you don t know cyril overton either holmes shook his head good humouredly great scott  cried the athlete  why  i was first reserve for england against wales  and i ve skippered the varsity all this year  but that s nothing  i didn t think there was a soul in england who didn t know godfrey staunton  the crack three quarter  cambridge  blackheath  and five internationals  good lord  mr  holmes  where have you lived holmes laughed at the young giant s naive astonishment you live in a different world to me  mr  overton a sweeter and healthier one  my ramifications stretch out into many sections of society  but never  i am happy to say  into amateur sport  which is the best and soundest thing in england  however  your unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do  so now  my good sir  i beg you to sit down and to tell me  slowly and quietly  exactly what it is that has occurred  and how you desire that i should help you young overton s face assumed the bothered look of the man who is more accustomed to using his muscles than his wits  but by degrees  with many repetitions and obscurities which i may omit from his narrative  he laid his strange story before us it s this way  mr  holmes  as i have said  i am the skipper of the rugger team of cambridge varsity  and godfrey staunton is my best man to morrow we play oxford  yesterday we all came up  and we settled at bentley s private hotel  at ten o clock i went round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost  for i believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit  i had a word or two with godfrey before he turned in  he seemed to me to be pale and bothered  i asked him what was the matter  he said he was all right just a touch of headache  i bade him good night and left him  half an hour later  the porter tells me that a rough looking man with a beard called with a note for godfrey  he had not gone to bed  and the note was taken to his room godfrey read it  and fell back in a chair as if he had been pole axed the porter was so scared that he was going to fetch me  but godfrey stopped him  had a drink of water  and pulled himself together  then he went downstairs  said a few words to the man who was waiting in the hall  and the two of them went off together  the last that the porter saw of them  they were almost running down the street in the direction of the strand  this morning godfrey s room was empty  his bed had never been slept in  and his things were all just as i had seen them the night before  he had gone off at a moment s notice with this stranger  and no word has come from him since  i don t believe he will ever come back  he was a sportsman  was godfrey  down to his marrow  and he wouldn t have stopped his training and let in his skipper if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him  no  i feel as if he were gone for good  and we should never see him again sherlock holmes listened with the deepest attention to this singular narrative what did you do  he asked i wired to cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him there i have had an answer  no one has seen him could he have got back to cambridge yes  there is a late train quarter past eleven but  so far as you can ascertain  he did not take it no  he has not been seen what did you do next i wired to lord mount james why to lord mount james godfrey is an orphan  and lord mount james is his nearest relative his uncle  i believe indeed  this throws new light upon the matter  lord mount james is one of the richest men in england so i ve heard godfrey say and your friend was closely related yes  he was his heir  and the old boy is nearly eighty cram full of gout  too  they say he could chalk his billiard cue with his knuckles he never allowed godfrey a shilling in his life  for he is an absolute miser  but it will all come to him right enough have you heard from lord mount james no what motive could your friend have in going to lord mount james well  something was worrying him the night before  and if it was to do with money it is possible that he would make for his nearest relative who had so much of it  though from all i have heard he would not have much chance of getting it  godfrey was not fond of the old man  he would not go if he could help it well  we can soon determine that  if your friend was going to his relative  lord mount james  you have then to explain the visit of this rough looking fellow at so late an hour  and the agitation that was caused by his coming cyril overton pressed his hands to his head  i can make nothing of it said he well  well  i have a clear day  and i shall be happy to look into the matter  said holmes  i should strongly recommend you to make your preparations for your match without reference to this young gentleman it must  as you say  have been an overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion  and the same necessity is likely to hold him away  let us step round together to the hotel  and see if the porter can throw any fresh light upon the matter sherlock holmes was a past master in the art of putting a humble witness at his ease  and very soon  in the privacy of godfrey staunton s abandoned room  he had extracted all that the porter had to tell the visitor of the night before was not a gentleman  neither was he a workingman  he was simply what the porter described as a medium looking chap  a man of fifty  beard grizzled  pale face  quietly dressed he seemed himself to be agitated  the porter had observed his hand trembling when he had held out the note  godfrey staunton had crammed the note into his pocket  staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall  they had exchanged a few sentences  of which the porter had only distinguished the one word time  then they had hurried off in the manner described  it was just half past ten by the hall clock let me see  said holmes  seating himself on staunton s bed  you are the day porter  are you not yes  sir  i go off duty at eleven the night porter saw nothing  i suppose no  sir  one theatre party came in late  no one else were you on duty all day yesterday yes  sir did you take any messages to mr  staunton yes  sir  one telegram ah  that s interesting  what o clock was this about six where was mr  staunton when he received it here in his room were you present when he opened it yes  sir  i waited to see if there was an answer well  was there yes  sir  he wrote an answer did you take it no  he took it himself but he wrote it in your presence yes  sir  i was standing by the door  and he with his back turned at that table  when he had written it  he said  all right  porter  i will take this myself what did he write it with a pen  sir was the telegraphic form one of these on the table yes  sir  it was the top one holmes rose  taking the forms  he carried them over to the window and carefully examined that which was uppermost it is a pity he did not write in pencil  said he  throwing them down again with a shrug of disappointment  as you have no doubt frequently observed  watson  the impression usually goes through a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage  however  i can find no trace here  i rejoice  however  to perceive that he wrote with a broad pointed quill pen  and i can hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this blotting pad  ah  yes  surely this is the very thing he tore off a strip of the blotting paper and turned towards us the following hieroglyphic graphic cyril overton was much excited  hold it to the glass  he cried that is unnecessary  said holmes  the paper is thin  and the reverse will give the message  here it is  he turned it over  and we read graphic stand by us for gods sake so that is the tail end of the telegram which godfrey staunton dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance  there are at least six words of the message which have escaped us  but what remains stand by us for god s sake proves that this young man saw a formidable danger which approached him  and from which someone else could protect him  us  mark you  another person was involved  who should it be but the pale faced  bearded man  who seemed himself in so nervous a state what  then  is the connection between godfrey staunton and the bearded man  and what is the third source from which each of them sought for help against pressing danger  our inquiry has already narrowed down to that we have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed  i suggested exactly  my dear watson  your reflection  though profound  had already crossed my mind  but i daresay it may have come to your notice that counterfoil of another man s message  there may be some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you  there is so much red tape in these matters  however  i have no doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be attained  meanwhile  i should like in your presence  mr  overton  to go through these papers which have been left upon the table there were a number of letters  bills  and notebooks  which holmes turned over and examined with quick  nervous fingers and darting penetrating eyes  nothing here  he said  at last  by the way  i suppose your friend was a healthy young fellow nothing amiss with him sound as a bell have you ever known him ill not a day  he has been laid up with a hack  and once he slipped his knee cap  but that was nothing perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose  i should think he may have had some secret trouble  with your assent  i will put one or two of these papers in my pocket  in case they should bear upon our future inquiry one moment one moment  cried a querulous voice  and we looked up to find a queer little old man  jerking and twitching in the doorway  he was dressed in rusty black  with a very broad brimmed top hat and a loose white necktie the whole effect being that of a very rustic parson or of an undertaker s mute  yet  in spite of his shabby and even absurd appearance  his voice had a sharp crackle  and his manner a quick intensity which commanded attention who are you  sir  and by what right do you touch this gentleman s papers  he asked i am a private detective  and i am endeavouring to explain his disappearance oh  you are  are you  and who instructed you  eh this gentleman  mr  staunton s friend  was referred to me by scotland yard who are you  sir i am cyril overton then it is you who sent me a telegram  my name is lord mount james  i came round as quickly as the bayswater bus would bring me  so you have instructed a detective yes  sir and are you prepared to meet the cost i have no doubt  sir  that my friend godfrey  when we find him  will be prepared to do that but if he is never found  eh  answer me that in that case  no doubt his family nothing of the sort  sir  screamed the little man  don t look to me for a penny not a penny  you understand that  mr  detective  i am all the family that this young man has got  and i tell you that i am not responsible  if he has any expectations it is due to the fact that i have never wasted money  and i do not propose to begin to do so now  as to those papers with which you are making so free  i may tell you that in case there should be anything of any value among them  you will be held strictly to account for what you do with them very good  sir  said sherlock holmes  may i ask  in the meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for this young man s disappearance no  sir  i have not  he is big enough and old enough to look after himself  and if he is so foolish as to lose himself  i entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him i quite understand your position  said holmes  with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes  perhaps you don t quite understand mine  godfrey staunton appears to have been a poor man  if he has been kidnapped  it could not have been for anything which he himself possesses  the fame of your wealth has gone abroad  lord mount james  and it is entirely possible that a gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from him some information as to your house  your habits  and your treasure the face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his neckcloth heavens  sir  what an idea  i never thought of such villainy  what inhuman rogues there are in the world  but godfrey is a fine lad a staunch lad  nothing would induce him to give his old uncle away  i ll have the plate moved over to the bank this evening  in the meantime spare no pains  mr  detective  i beg you to leave no stone unturned to bring him safely back  as to money  well  so far as a fiver or even a tenner goes you can always look to me even in his chastened frame of mind  the noble miser could give us no information which could help us  for he knew little of the private life of his nephew  our only clue lay in the truncated telegram  and with a copy of this in his hand holmes set forth to find a second link for his chain  we had shaken off lord mount james  and overton had gone to consult with the other members of his team over the misfortune which had befallen them there was a telegraph office at a short distance from the hotel  we halted outside it it s worth trying  watson  said holmes  of course  with a warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils  but we have not reached that stage yet  i don t suppose they remember faces in so busy a place  let us venture it i am sorry to trouble you  said he  in his blandest manner  to the young woman behind the grating  there is some small mistake about a telegram i sent yesterday  i have had no answer  and i very much fear that i must have omitted to put my name at the end  could you tell me if this was so the young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils what o clock was it  she asked a little after six whom was it to holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me  the last words in it were for god s sake  he whispered  confidentially  i am very anxious at getting no answer the young woman separated one of the forms this is it  there is no name  said she  smoothing it out upon the counter then that  of course  accounts for my getting no answer  said holmes dear me  how very stupid of me  to be sure  good morning  miss  and many thanks for having relieved my mind  he chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the street once more well  i asked we progress  my dear watson  we progress  i had seven different schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram  but i could hardly hope to succeed the very first time and what have you gained a starting point for our investigation  he hailed a cab  king s cross station  said he we have a journey  then yes  i think we must run down to cambridge together  all the indications seem to me to point in that direction tell me  i asked  as we rattled up gray s inn road  have you any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance  i don t think that among all our cases i have known one where the motives are more obscure surely you don t really imagine that he may be kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy uncle i confess  my dear watson  that that does not appeal to me as a very probable explanation  it struck me  however  as being the one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant old person it certainly did that  but what are your alternatives i could mention several  you must admit that it is curious and suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this important match  and should involve the only man whose presence seems essential to the success of the side  it may  of course  be a coincidence  but it is interesting  amateur sport is free from betting  but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the public  and it is possible that it might be worth someone s while to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a race horse  there is one explanation  a second very obvious one is that this young man really is the heir of a great property  however modest his means may at present be  and it is not impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be concocted these theories take no account of the telegram quite true  watson  the telegram still remains the only solid thing with which we have to deal  and we must not permit our attention to wander away from it  it is to gain light upon the purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to cambridge  the path of our investigation is at present obscure  but i shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not cleared it up  or made a considerable advance along it it was already dark when we reached the old university city  holmes took a cab at the station and ordered the man to drive to the house of dr leslie armstrong  a few minutes later  we had stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare  we were shown in  and after a long wait were at last admitted into the consulting room  where we found the doctor seated behind his table it argues the degree in which i had lost touch with my profession that the name of leslie armstrong was unknown to me  now i am aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school of the university but a thinker of european reputation in more than one branch of science yet even without knowing his brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere glance at the man  the square  massive face  the brooding eyes under the thatched brows  and the granite moulding of the inflexible jaw  a man of deep character  a man with an alert mind  grim ascetic  self contained  formidable so i read dr  leslie armstrong  he held my friend s card in his hand  and he looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features i have heard your name  mr  sherlock holmes  and i am aware of your profession one of which i by no means approve in that  doctor  you will find yourself in agreement with every criminal in the country  said my friend  quietly so far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of crime sir  they must have the support of every reasonable member of the community  though i cannot doubt that the official machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose  where your calling is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of private individuals  when you rake up family matters which are better hidden  and when you incidentally waste the time of men who are more busy than yourself  at the present moment  for example  i should be writing a treatise instead of conversing with you no doubt  doctor  and yet the conversation may prove more important than the treatise  incidentally  i may tell you that we are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame  and that we are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case is fairly in the hands of the official police  you may look upon me simply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the regular forces of the country  i have come to ask you about mr  godfrey staunton what about him you know him  do you not he is an intimate friend of mine you are aware that he has disappeared ah  indeed  there was no change of expression in the rugged features of the doctor he left his hotel last night he has not been heard of no doubt he will return to morrow is the varsity football match i have no sympathy with these childish games  the young man s fate interests me deeply  since i know him and like him  the football match does not come within my horizon at all i claim your sympathy  then  in my investigation of mr  staunton s fate  do you know where he is certainly not you have not seen him since yesterday no  i have not was mr  staunton a healthy man absolutely did you ever know him ill never holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctor s eyes  then perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen guineas  paid by mr godfrey staunton last month to dr  leslie armstrong  of cambridge  i picked it out from among the papers upon his desk the doctor flushed with anger i do not feel that there is any reason why i should render an explanation to you  mr  holmes holmes replaced the bill in his notebook  if you prefer a public explanation  it must come sooner or later  said he  i have already told you that i can hush up that which others will be bound to publish and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence i know nothing about it did you hear from mr  staunton in london certainly not dear me  dear me the postoffice again  holmes sighed  wearily a most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from london by godfrey staunton at six fifteen yesterday evening a telegram which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearance and yet you have not had it  it is most culpable  i shall certainly go down to the office here and register a complaint dr  leslie armstrong sprang up from behind his desk  and his dark face was crimson with fury i ll trouble you to walk out of my house  sir  said he  you can tell your employer  lord mount james  that i do not wish to have anything to do either with him or with his agents  no  sir not another word  he rang the bell furiously  john  show these gentlemen out  a pompous butler ushered us severely to the door  and we found ourselves in the street  holmes burst out laughing dr  leslie armstrong is certainly a man of energy and character  said he  i have not seen a man who  if he turns his talents that way  was more calculated to fill the gap left by the illustrious moriarty and now  my poor watson  here we are  stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town  which we cannot leave without abandoning our case this little inn just opposite armstrong s house is singularly adapted to our needs  if you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for the night  i may have time to make a few inquiries these few inquiries proved  however  to be a more lengthy proceeding than holmes had imagined  for he did not return to the inn until nearly nine o clock  he was pale and dejected  stained with dust  and exhausted with hunger and fatigue  a cold supper was ready upon the table  and when his needs were satisfied and his pipe alight he was ready to take that half comic and wholly philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were going awry  the sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and glance out of the window  a brougham and pair of grays under the glare of a gas lamp  stood before the doctor s door it s been out three hours  said holmes  started at half past six  and here it is back again  that gives a radius of ten or twelve miles  and he does it once  or sometimes twice  a day no unusual thing for a doctor in practice but armstrong is not really a doctor in practice  he is a lecturer and a consultant  but he does not care for general practice  which distracts him from his literary work  why  then  does he make these long journeys which must be exceedingly irksome to him  and who is it that he visits his coachman my dear watson  can you doubt that it was to him that i first applied i do not know whether it came from his own innate depravity or from the promptings of his master  but he was rude enough to set a dog at me neither dog nor man liked the look of my stick  however  and the matter fell through  relations were strained after that  and further inquiries out of the question  all that i have learned i got from a friendly native in the yard of our own inn  it was he who told me of the doctor s habits and of his daily journey  at that instant  to give point to his words  the carriage came round to the door could you not follow it excellent  watson  you are scintillating this evening  the idea did cross my mind  there is  as you may have observed  a bicycle shop next to our inn  into this i rushed  engaged a bicycle  and was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of sight  i rapidly overtook it  and then  keeping at a discreet distance of a hundred yards or so  i followed its lights until we were clear of the town  we had got well out on the country road  when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred  the carriage stopped  the doctor alighted  walked swiftly back to where i had also halted  and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he feared the road was narrow  and that he hoped his carriage did not impede the passage of my bicycle  nothing could have been more admirable than his way of putting it  i at once rode past the carriage  and keeping to the main road  i went on for a few miles  and then halted in a convenient place to see if the carriage passed  there was no sign of it  however  and so it became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads which i had observed  i rode back  but again saw nothing of the carriage  and now  as you perceive  it has returned after me  of course  i had at the outset no particular reason to connect these journeys with the disappearance of godfrey staunton  and was only inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that everything which concerns dr  armstrong is at present of interest to us  but  now that i find he keeps so keen a look out upon anyone who may follow him on these excursions  the affair appears more important  and i shall not be satisfied until i have made the matter clear we can follow him to morrow can we  it is not so easy as you seem to think  you are not familiar with cambridgeshire scenery  are you  it does not lend itself to concealment  all this country that i passed over to night is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand  and the man we are following is no fool as he very clearly showed to night  i have wired to overton to let us know any fresh london developments at this address  and in the meantime we can only concentrate our attention upon dr  armstrong  whose name the obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the counterfoil of staunton s urgent message  he knows where the young man is to that i ll swear  and if he knows  then it must be our own fault if we cannot manage to know also  at present it must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession  and  as you are aware  watson  it is not my habit to leave the game in that condition and yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the mystery  a note was handed in after breakfast  which holmes passed across to me with a smile sir it ran i can assure you that you are wasting your time in dogging my movements i have  as you discovered last night  a window at the back of my brougham  and if you desire a twenty mile ride which will lead you to the spot from which you started  you have only to follow me  meanwhile i can inform you that no spying upon me can in any way help mr  godfrey staunton  and i am convinced that the best service you can do to that gentleman is to return at once to london and to report to your employer that you are unable to trace him  your time in cambridge will certainly be wasted  yours faithfully  leslie armstrong an outspoken  honest antagonist is the doctor  said holmes  well well  he excites my curiosity  and i must really know before i leave him his carriage is at his door now  said i  there he is stepping into it  i saw him glance up at our window as he did so  suppose i try my luck upon the bicycle no  no  my dear watson  with all respect for your natural acumen  i do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy doctor  i think that possibly i can attain our end by some independent explorations of my own  i am afraid that i must leave you to your own devices  as the appearance of two inquiring strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than i care for  no doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in this venerable city  and i hope to bring back a more favourable report to you before evening once more  however  my friend was destined to be disappointed  he came back at night weary and unsuccessful i have had a blank day  watson  having got the doctor s general direction  i spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that side of cambridge  and comparing notes with publicans and other local news agencies  i have covered some ground  chesterton  histon  waterbeach and oakington have each been explored  and have each proved disappointing  the daily appearance of a brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such sleepy hollows  the doctor has scored once more  is there a telegram for me yes  i opened it  here it is ask for pompey from jeremy dixon  trinity college i don t understand it oh  it is clear enough  it is from our friend overton  and is in answer to a question from me  i ll just send round a note to mr  jeremy dixon and then i have no doubt that our luck will turn  by the way  is there any news of the match yes  the local evening paper has an excellent account in its last edition  oxford won by a goal and two tries  the last sentences of the description say the defeat of the light blues may be entirely attributed to the unfortunate absence of the crack international  godfrey staunton  whose want was felt at every instant of the game  the lack of combination in the three quarter line and their weakness both in attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy and hard working pack then our friend overton s forebodings have been justified  said holmes  personally i am in agreement with dr  armstrong  and football does not come within my horizon  early to bed to night  watson  for i foresee that to morrow may be an eventful day i was horrified by my first glimpse of holmes next morning  for he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe  i associated that instrument with the single weakness of his nature  and i feared the worst when i saw it glittering in his hand  he laughed at my expression of dismay and laid it upon the table no  no  my dear fellow  there is no cause for alarm  it is not upon this occasion the instrument of evil  but it will rather prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery  on this syringe i base all my hopes i have just returned from a small scouting expedition  and everything is favourable  eat a good breakfast  watson  for i propose to get upon dr armstrong s trail to day  and once on it i will not stop for rest or food until i run him to his burrow in that case  said i  we had best carry our breakfast with us  for he is making an early start  his carriage is at the door never mind  let him go  he will be clever if he can drive where i cannot follow him  when you have finished  come downstairs with me  and i will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent specialist in the work that lies before us when we descended i followed holmes into the stable yard  where he opened the door of a loose box and led out a squat  lop eared white and tan dog  something between a beagle and a foxhound let me introduce you to pompey  said he  pompey is the pride of the local draghounds no very great flier  as his build will show  but a staunch hound on a scent  well  pompey  you may not be fast  but i expect you will be too fast for a couple of middle aged london gentlemen  so i will take the liberty of fastening this leather leash to your collar  now  boy  come along  and show what you can do  he led him across to the doctor s door  the dog sniffed round for an instant  and then with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster  in half an hour  we were clear of the town and hastening down a country road what have you done  holmes  i asked a threadbare and venerable device  but useful upon occasion  i walked into the doctor s yard this morning  and shot my syringe full of aniseed over the hind wheel  a draghound will follow aniseed from here to john o groat s  and our friend  armstrong  would have to drive through the cam before he would shake pompey off his trail  oh  the cunning rascal this is how he gave me the slip the other night the dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a grass grown lane  half a mile farther this opened into another broad road  and the trail turned hard to the right in the direction of the town  which we had just quitted  the road took a sweep to the south of the town  and continued in the opposite direction to that in which we started this detour has been entirely for our benefit  then  said holmes no wonder that my inquiries among those villagers led to nothing  the doctor has certainly played the game for all it is worth  and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate deception  this should be the village of trumpington to the right of us  and  by jove  here is the brougham coming round the corner  quick  watson quick  or we are done he sprang through a gate into a field  dragging the reluctant pompey after him  we had hardly got under the shelter of the hedge when the carriage rattled past  i caught a glimpse of dr  armstrong within  his shoulders bowed  his head sunk on his hands  the very image of distress i could tell by my companion s graver face that he also had seen i fear there is some dark ending to our quest  said he  it cannot be long before we know it  come  pompey  ah  it is the cottage in the field there could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our journey pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate  where the marks of the brougham s wheels were still to be seen  a footpath led across to the lonely cottage  holmes tied the dog to the hedge  and we hastened onward  my friend knocked at the little rustic door  and knocked again without response  and yet the cottage was not deserted  for a low sound came to our ears a kind of drone of misery and despair which was indescribably melancholy  holmes paused irresolute  and then he glanced back at the road which he had just traversed  a brougham was coming down it  and there could be no mistaking those gray horses by jove  the doctor is coming back  cried holmes  that settles it  we are bound to see what it means before he comes he opened the door  and we stepped into the hall  the droning sound swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long  deep wail of distress  it came from upstairs  holmes darted up  and i followed him he pushed open a half closed door  and we both stood appalled at the sight before us a woman  young and beautiful  was lying dead upon the bed  her calm pale face  with dim  wide opened blue eyes  looked upward from amid a great tangle of golden hair  at the foot of the bed  half sitting  half kneeling  his face buried in the clothes  was a young man  whose frame was racked by his sobs  so absorbed was he by his bitter grief  that he never looked up until holmes s hand was on his shoulder are you mr  godfrey staunton yes  yes  i am but you are too late  she is dead the man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance  holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation and to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his sudden disappearance when there was a step upon the stairs  and there was the heavy  stern questioning face of dr  armstrong at the door so  gentlemen  said he  you have attained your end and have certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your intrusion  i would not brawl in the presence of death  but i can assure you that if i were a younger man your monstrous conduct would not pass with impunity excuse me  dr  armstrong  i think we are a little at cross purposes said my friend  with dignity  if you could step downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the other upon this miserable affair a minute later  the grim doctor and ourselves were in the sitting room below well  sir  said he i wish you to understand  in the first place  that i am not employed by lord mount james  and that my sympathies in this matter are entirely against that nobleman  when a man is lost it is my duty to ascertain his fate  but having done so the matter ends so far as i am concerned  and so long as there is nothing criminal i am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than to give them publicity  if  as i imagine  there is no breach of the law in this matter  you can absolutely depend upon my discretion and my cooperation in keeping the facts out of the papers dr  armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung holmes by the hand you are a good fellow  said he  i had misjudged you  i thank heaven that my compunction at leaving poor staunton all alone in this plight caused me to turn my carriage back and so to make your acquaintance knowing as much as you do  the situation is very easily explained a year ago godfrey staunton lodged in london for a time and became passionately attached to his landlady s daughter  whom he married  she was as good as she was beautiful and as intelligent as she was good no man need be ashamed of such a wife  but godfrey was the heir to this crabbed old nobleman  and it was quite certain that the news of his marriage would have been the end of his inheritance  i knew the lad well  and i loved him for his many excellent qualities  i did all i could to help him to keep things straight  we did our very best to keep the thing from everyone  for  when once such a whisper gets about  it is not long before everyone has heard it  thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion  godfrey has up to now succeeded  their secret was known to no one save to me and to one excellent servant  who has at present gone for assistance to trumpington  but at last there came a terrible blow in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife  it was consumption of the most virulent kind  the poor boy was half crazed with grief  and yet he had to go to london to play this match  for he could not get out of it without explanations which would expose his secret  i tried to cheer him up by wire  and he sent me one in reply  imploring me to do all i could  this was the telegram which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen  i did not tell him how urgent the danger was  for i knew that he could do no good here  but i sent the truth to the girl s father  and he very injudiciously communicated it to godfrey the result was that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy  and has remained in the same state  kneeling at the end of her bed  until this morning death put an end to her sufferings  that is all mr  holmes  and i am sure that i can rely upon your discretion and that of your friend holmes grasped the doctor s hand come  watson  said he  and we passed from that house of grief into the pale sunlight of the winter day the adventure of the abbey grange it was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning  towards the end of the winter of  that i was awakened by a tugging at my shoulder  it was holmes  the candle in his hand shone upon his eager  stooping face  and told me at a glance that something was amiss come  watson  come  he cried  the game is afoot  not a word  into your clothes and come ten minutes later we were both in a cab  and rattling through the silent streets on our way to charing cross station  the first faint winter s dawn was beginning to appear  and we could dimly see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us  blurred and indistinct in the opalescent london reek  holmes nestled in silence into his heavy coat  and i was glad to do the same  for the air was most bitter  and neither of us had broken our fast it was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and taken our places in the kentish train that we were sufficiently thawed  he to speak and i to listen  holmes drew a note from his pocket  and read aloud abbey grange  marsham  kent   a m  my dear mr  holmes i should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what promises to be a most remarkable case  it is something quite in your line  except for releasing the lady i will see that everything is kept exactly as i have found it  but i beg you not to lose an instant  as it is difficult to leave sir eustace there  yours faithfully  stanley hopkins hopkins has called me in seven times  and on each occasion his summons has been entirely justified  said holmes  i fancy that every one of his cases has found its way into your collection  and i must admit watson  that you have some power of selection  which atones for much which i deplore in your narratives  your fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might have been an instructive and even classical series of demonstrations  you slur over work of the utmost finesse and delicacy  in order to dwell upon sensational details which may excite  but cannot possibly instruct  the reader why do you not write them yourself  i said  with some bitterness i will  my dear watson  i will  at present i am  as you know  fairly busy  but i propose to devote my declining years to the composition of a textbook  which shall focus the whole art of detection into one volume our present research appears to be a case of murder you think this sir eustace is dead  then i should say so  hopkins s writing shows considerable agitation  and he is not an emotional man  yes  i gather there has been violence  and that the body is left for our inspection  a mere suicide would not have caused him to send for me  as to the release of the lady  it would appear that she has been locked in her room during the tragedy  we are moving in high life  watson  crackling paper  e b  monogram coat of arms  picturesque address  i think that friend hopkins will live up to his reputation  and that we shall have an interesting morning  the crime was committed before twelve last night how can you possibly tell by an inspection of the trains  and by reckoning the time  the local police had to be called in  they had to communicate with scotland yard hopkins had to go out  and he in turn had to send for me  all that makes a fair night s work  well  here we are at chiselhurst station  and we shall soon set our doubts at rest a drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought us to a park gate  which was opened for us by an old lodge keeper  whose haggard face bore the reflection of some great disaster  the avenue ran through a noble park  between lines of ancient elms  and ended in a low widespread house  pillared in front after the fashion of palladio  the central part was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy  but the large windows showed that modern changes had been carried out  and one wing of the house appeared to be entirely new  the youthful figure and alert  eager face of inspector stanley hopkins confronted us in the open doorway i m very glad you have come  mr  holmes  and you  too  dr  watson  but indeed  if i had my time over again  i should not have troubled you  for since the lady has come to herself  she has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not much left for us to do  you remember that lewisham gang of burglars what  the three randalls exactly  the father and two sons  it s their work  i have not a doubt of it  they did a job at sydenham a fortnight ago and were seen and described  rather cool to do another so soon and so near  but it is they  beyond all doubt  it s a hanging matter this time sir eustace is dead  then yes  his head was knocked in with his own poker sir eustace brackenstall  the driver tells me exactly one of the richest men in kent lady brackenstall is in the morning room  poor lady  she has had a most dreadful experience  she seemed half dead when i saw her first  i think you had best see her and hear her account of the facts  then we will examine the dining room together lady brackenstall was no ordinary person  seldom have i seen so graceful a figure  so womanly a presence  and so beautiful a face  she was a blonde  golden haired  blue eyed  and would no doubt have had the perfect complexion which goes with such colouring  had not her recent experience left her drawn and haggard  her sufferings were physical as well as mental  for over one eye rose a hideous  plum coloured swelling which her maid  a tall  austere woman  was bathing assiduously with vinegar and water  the lady lay back exhausted upon a couch  but her quick  observant gaze  as we entered the room  and the alert expression of her beautiful features  showed that neither her wits nor her courage had been shaken by her terrible experience  she was enveloped in a loose dressing gown of blue and silver  but a black sequin covered dinner dress lay upon the couch beside her i have told you all that happened  mr  hopkins  she said  wearily could you not repeat it for me  well  if you think it necessary  i will tell these gentlemen what occurred  have they been in the dining room yet i thought they had better hear your ladyship s story first i shall be glad when you can arrange matters  it is horrible to me to think of him still lying there  she shuddered and buried her face in her hands  as she did so  the loose gown fell back from her forearms holmes uttered an exclamation you have other injuries  madam  what is this  two vivid red spots stood out on one of the white  round limbs  she hastily covered it it is nothing  it has no connection with this hideous business to night  if you and your friend will sit down  i will tell you all i can i am the wife of sir eustace brackenstall  i have been married about a year  i suppose that it is no use my attempting to conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one  i fear that all our neighbours would tell you that  even if i were to attempt to deny it  perhaps the fault may be partly mine  i was brought up in the freer  less conventional atmosphere of south australia  and this english life  with its proprieties and its primness  is not congenial to me  but the main reason lies in the one fact  which is notorious to everyone  and that is that sir eustace was a confirmed drunkard  to be with such a man for an hour is unpleasant  can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and high spirited woman to be tied to him for day and night  it is a sacrilege  a crime  a villainy to hold that such a marriage is binding i say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a curse upon the land god will not let such wickedness endure  for an instant she sat up  her cheeks flushed  and her eyes blazing from under the terrible mark upon her brow  then the strong  soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the cushion  and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing  at last she continued i will tell you about last night  you are aware  perhaps  that in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing  this central block is made up of the dwelling rooms  with the kitchen behind and our bedroom above  my maid  theresa  sleeps above my room  there is no one else  and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing  this must have been well known to the robbers  or they would not have acted as they did sir eustace retired about half past ten  the servants had already gone to their quarters  only my maid was up  and she had remained in her room at the top of the house until i needed her services  i sat until after eleven in this room  absorbed in a book  then i walked round to see that all was right before i went upstairs  it was my custom to do this myself  for  as i have explained  sir eustace was not always to be trusted  i went into the kitchen  the butler s pantry  the gun room the billiard room  the drawing room  and finally the dining room  as i approached the window  which is covered with thick curtains  i suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was open  i flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face with a broad shouldered elderly man  who had just stepped into the room  the window is a long french one  which really forms a door leading to the lawn  i held my bedroom candle lit in my hand  and  by its light  behind the first man i saw two others  who were in the act of entering  i stepped back  but the fellow was on me in an instant  he caught me first by the wrist and then by the throat  i opened my mouth to scream  but he struck me a savage blow with his fist over the eye  and felled me to the ground  i must have been unconscious for a few minutes  for when i came to myself  i found that they had torn down the bell rope  and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the head of the dining table  i was so firmly bound that i could not move  and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from uttering a sound  it was at this instant that my unfortunate husband entered the room  he had evidently heard some suspicious sounds  and he came prepared for such a scene as he found he was dressed in nightshirt and trousers  with his favourite blackthorn cudgel in his hand  he rushed at the burglars  but another it was an elderly man stooped  picked the poker out of the grate and struck him a horrible blow as he passed  he fell with a groan and never moved again i fainted once more  but again it could only have been for a very few minutes during which i was insensible  when i opened my eyes i found that they had collected the silver from the sideboard  and they had drawn a bottle of wine which stood there  each of them had a glass in his hand  i have already told you  have i not  that one was elderly with a beard  and the others young  hairless lads  they might have been a father with his two sons  they talked together in whispers  then they came over and made sure that i was securely bound  finally they withdrew  closing the window after them  it was quite a quarter of an hour before i got my mouth free  when i did so  my screams brought the maid to my assistance  the other servants were soon alarmed  and we sent for the local police  who instantly communicated with london  that is really all that i can tell you  gentlemen  and i trust that it will not be necessary for me to go over so painful a story again any questions  mr  holmes  asked hopkins i will not impose any further tax upon lady brackenstall s patience and time  said holmes  before i go into the dining room  i should like to hear your experience  he looked at the maid i saw the men before ever they came into the house  said she  as i sat by my bedroom window i saw three men in the moonlight down by the lodge gate yonder  but i thought nothing of it at the time  it was more than an hour after that i heard my mistress scream  and down i ran  to find her  poor lamb  just as she says  and him on the floor  with his blood and brains over the room  it was enough to drive a woman out of her wits  tied there  and her very dress spotted with him  but she never wanted courage  did miss mary fraser of adelaide and lady brackenstall of abbey grange hasn t learned new ways  you ve questioned her long enough  you gentlemen  and now she is coming to her own room  just with her old theresa  to get the rest that she badly needs with a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her mistress and led her from the room she has been with her all her life  said hopkins  nursed her as a baby  and came with her to england when they first left australia eighteen months ago  theresa wright is her name  and the kind of maid you don t pick up nowadays  this way  mr  holmes  if you please the keen interest had passed out of holmes s expressive face  and i knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had departed  there still remained an arrest to be effected  but what were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with them  an abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has been called in for a case of measles would experience something of the annoyance which i read in my friend s eyes  yet the scene in the dining room of the abbey grange was sufficiently strange to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest it was a very large and high chamber  with carved oak ceiling  oaken panelling  and a fine array of deer s heads and ancient weapons around the walls  at the further end from the door was the high french window of which we had heard  three smaller windows on the right hand side filled the apartment with cold winter sunshine  on the left was a large deep fireplace  with a massive  overhanging oak mantelpiece  beside the fireplace was a heavy oaken chair with arms and cross bars at the bottom  in and out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord which was secured at each side to the crosspiece below  in releasing the lady  the cord had been slipped off her  but the knots with which it had been secured still remained  these details only struck our attention afterwards  for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by the terrible object which lay upon the tigerskin hearthrug in front of the fire it was the body of a tall  well made man  about forty years of age he lay upon his back  his face upturned  with his white teeth grinning through his short  black beard  his two clenched hands were raised above his head  and a heavy  blackthorn stick lay across them  his dark handsome  aquiline features were convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred  which had set his dead face in a terribly fiendish expression he had evidently been in his bed when the alarm had broken out  for he wore a foppish  embroidered nightshirt  and his bare feet projected from his trousers  his head was horribly injured  and the whole room bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck him down beside him lay the heavy poker  bent into a curve by the concussion holmes examined both it and the indescribable wreck which it had wrought he must be a powerful man  this elder randall  he remarked yes  said hopkins  i have some record of the fellow  and he is a rough customer you should have no difficulty in getting him not the slightest  we have been on the look out for him  and there was some idea that he had got away to america  now that we know that the gang are here  i don t see how they can escape  we have the news at every seaport already  and a reward will be offered before evening  what beats me is how they could have done so mad a thing  knowing that the lady could describe them and that we could not fail to recognize the description exactly  one would have expected that they would silence lady brackenstall as well they may not have realized  i suggested  that she had recovered from her faint that is likely enough  if she seemed to be senseless  they would not take her life  what about this poor fellow  hopkins  i seem to have heard some queer stories about him he was a good hearted man when he was sober  but a perfect fiend when he was drunk  or rather when he was half drunk  for he seldom really went the whole way  the devil seemed to be in him at such times  and he was capable of anything  from what i hear  in spite of all his wealth and his title  he very nearly came our way once or twice  there was a scandal about his drenching a dog with petroleum and setting it on fire her ladyship s dog  to make the matter worse and that was only hushed up with difficulty  then he threw a decanter at that maid theresa wright there was trouble about that  on the whole  and between ourselves  it will be a brighter house without him  what are you looking at now holmes was down on his knees  examining with great attention the knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured  then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down when this was pulled down  the bell in the kitchen must have rung loudly  he remarked no one could hear it  the kitchen stands right at the back of the house how did the burglar know no one would hear it  how dared he pull at a bell rope in that reckless fashion exactly  mr  holmes  exactly  you put the very question which i have asked myself again and again  there can be no doubt that this fellow must have known the house and its habits  he must have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed at that comparatively early hour  and that no one could possibly hear a bell ring in the kitchen  therefore  he must have been in close league with one of the servants  surely that is evident  but there are eight servants  and all of good character other things being equal  said holmes  one would suspect the one at whose head the master threw a decanter  and yet that would involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems devoted  well well  the point is a minor one  and when you have randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his accomplice  the lady s story certainly seems to be corroborated  if it needed corroboration  by every detail which we see before us  he walked to the french window and threw it open  there are no signs here  but the ground is iron hard  and one would not expect them  i see that these candles in the mantelpiece have been lighted yes  it was by their light and that of the lady s bedroom candle  that the burglars saw their way about and what did they take well  they did not take much only half a dozen articles of plate off the sideboard  lady brackenstall thinks that they were themselves so disturbed by the death of sir eustace that they did not ransack the house  as they would otherwise have done no doubt that is true  and yet they drank some wine  i understand to steady their nerves exactly  these three glasses upon the sideboard have been untouched  i suppose yes  and the bottle stands as they left it let us look at it  halloa  halloa  what is this the three glasses were grouped together  all of them tinged with wine and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing  the bottle stood near them  two thirds full  and beside it lay a long  deeply stained cork its appearance and the dust upon the bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers had enjoyed a change had come over holmes s manner  he had lost his listless expression  and again i saw an alert light of interest in his keen deep set eyes  he raised the cork and examined it minutely how did they draw it  he asked hopkins pointed to a half opened drawer  in it lay some table linen and a large corkscrew did lady brackenstall say that screw was used no  you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the bottle was opened quite so  as a matter of fact  that screw was not used  this bottle was opened by a pocket screw  probably contained in a knife  and not more than an inch and a half long  if you will examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was driven in three times before the cork was extracted  it has never been transfixed  this long screw would have transfixed it and drawn it up with a single pull  when you catch this fellow  you will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his possession excellent  said hopkins but these glasses do puzzle me  i confess  lady brackenstall actually saw the three men drinking  did she not yes  she was clear about that then there is an end of it  what more is to be said  and yet  you must admit  that the three glasses are very remarkable  hopkins  what  you see nothing remarkable  well  well  let it pass  perhaps  when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own  it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand  of course  it must be a mere chance about the glasses  well  good morning hopkins  i don t see that i can be of any use to you  and you appear to have your case very clear  you will let me know when randall is arrested  and any further developments which may occur  i trust that i shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful conclusion  come watson  i fancy that we may employ ourselves more profitably at home during our return journey  i could see by holmes s face that he was much puzzled by something which he had observed  every now and then  by an effort  he would throw off the impression  and talk as if the matter were clear  but then his doubts would settle down upon him again  and his knitted brows and abstracted eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the great dining room of the abbey grange  in which this midnight tragedy had been enacted  at last  by a sudden impulse  just as our train was crawling out of a suburban station  he sprang on to the platform and pulled me out after him excuse me  my dear fellow  said he  as we watched the rear carriages of our train disappearing round a curve  i am sorry to make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim  but on my life  watson  i simply can t leave that case in this condition  every instinct that i possess cries out against it  it s wrong it s all wrong i ll swear that it s wrong  and yet the lady s story was complete  the maid s corroboration was sufficient  the detail was fairly exact  what have i to put up against that  three wine glasses  that is all  but if i had not taken things for granted  if i had examined everything with the care which i should have shown had we approached the case de novo and had no cut and dried story to warp my mind  should i not then have found something more definite to go upon  of course i should  sit down on this bench  watson  until a train for chiselhurst arrives  and allow me to lay the evidence before you  imploring you in the first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be true  the lady s charming personality must not be permitted to warp our judgment surely there are details in her story which  if we looked at in cold blood  would excite our suspicion  these burglars made a considerable haul at sydenham a fortnight ago  some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers  and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part as a matter of fact  burglars who have done a good stroke of business are  as a rule  only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking  again  it is unusual for burglars to operate at so early an hour  it is unusual for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming  since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream  it is unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man  it is unusual for them to be content with a limited plunder when there was much more within their reach  and finally  i should say  that it was very unusual for such men to leave a bottle half empty  how do all these unusuals strike you  watson their cumulative effect is certainly considerable  and yet each of them is quite possible in itself  the most unusual thing of all  as it seems to me  is that the lady should be tied to the chair well  i am not so clear about that  watson  for it is evident that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way that she could not give immediate notice of their escape  but at any rate i have shown have i not  that there is a certain element of improbability about the lady s story  and now  on the top of this  comes the incident of the wineglasses what about the wineglasses can you see them in your mind s eye i see them clearly we are told that three men drank from them  does that strike you as likely why not  there was wine in each glass exactly  but there was beeswing only in one glass  you must have noticed that fact  what does that suggest to your mind the last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing not at all  the bottle was full of it  and it is inconceivable that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily charged with it there are two possible explanations  and only two  one is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was violently agitated  and so the third glass received the beeswing  that does not appear probable  no no  i am sure that i am right what  then  do you suppose that only two glasses were used  and that the dregs of both were poured into a third glass  so as to give the false impression that three people had been here  in that way all the beeswing would be in the last glass would it not  yes  i am convinced that this is so  but if i have hit upon the true explanation of this one small phenomenon  then in an instant the case rises from the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable  for it can only mean that lady brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied to us  that not one word of their story is to be believed  that they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal  and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any help from them  that is the mission which now lies before us  and here watson  is the sydenham train the household at the abbey grange were much surprised at our return  but sherlock holmes  finding that stanley hopkins had gone off to report to headquarters  took possession of the dining room  locked the door upon the inside  and devoted himself for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations which form the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of deduction were reared  seated in a corner like an interested student who observes the demonstration of his professor i followed every step of that remarkable research  the window  the curtains  the carpet  the chair  the rope each in turn was minutely examined and duly pondered  the body of the unfortunate baronet had been removed  and all else remained as we had seen it in the morning finally  to my astonishment  holmes climbed up on to the massive mantelpiece  far above his head hung the few inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire  for a long time he gazed upward at it and then in an attempt to get nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the wall  this brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end of the rope  but it was not this so much as the bracket itself which seemed to engage his attention  finally  he sprang down with an ejaculation of satisfaction it s all right  watson  said he  we have got our case one of the most remarkable in our collection  but  dear me  how slow witted i have been  and how nearly i have committed the blunder of my lifetime  now  i think that  with a few missing links  my chain is almost complete you have got your men man  watson  man  only one  but a very formidable person  strong as a lion witness the blow that bent that poker  six foot three in height active as a squirrel  dexterous with his fingers  finally  remarkably quick witted  for this whole ingenious story is of his concoction  yes watson  we have come upon the handiwork of a very remarkable individual and yet  in that bell rope  he has given us a clue which should not have left us a doubt where was the clue well  if you were to pull down a bell rope  watson  where would you expect it to break  surely at the spot where it is attached to the wire why should it break three inches from the top  as this one has done because it is frayed there exactly  this end  which we can examine  is frayed  he was cunning enough to do that with his knife  but the other end is not frayed  you could not observe that from here  but if you were on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without any mark of fraying whatever you can reconstruct what occurred  the man needed the rope  he would not tear it down for fear of giving the alarm by ringing the bell  what did he do  he sprang up on the mantelpiece  could not quite reach it  put his knee on the bracket you will see the impression in the dust and so got his knife to bear upon the cord  i could not reach the place by at least three inches from which i infer that he is at least three inches a bigger man than i  look at that mark upon the seat of the oaken chair what is it blood undoubtedly it is blood  this alone puts the lady s story out of court if she were seated on the chair when the crime was done  how comes that mark  no  no  she was placed in the chair after the death of her husband  i ll wager that the black dress shows a corresponding mark to this  we have not yet met our waterloo  watson  but this is our marengo for it begins in defeat and ends in victory  i should like now to have a few words with the nurse  theresa  we must be wary for a while  if we are to get the information which we want she was an interesting person  this stern australian nurse taciturn suspicious  ungracious  it took some time before holmes s pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she said thawed her into a corresponding amiability  she did not attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer yes  sir  it is true that he threw the decanter at me  i heard him call my mistress a name  and i told him that he would not dare to speak so if her brother had been there  then it was that he threw it at me  he might have thrown a dozen if he had but left my bonny bird alone  he was forever ill treating her  and she too proud to complain  she will not even tell me all that he has done to her  she never told me of those marks on her arm that you saw this morning  but i know very well that they come from a stab with a hatpin  the sly devil god forgive me that i should speak of him so  now that he is dead  but a devil he was  if ever one walked the earth  he was all honey when first we met him only eighteen months ago  and we both feel as if it were eighteen years  she had only just arrived in london  yes  it was her first voyage she had never been from home before  he won her with his title and his money and his false london ways  if she made a mistake she has paid for it if ever a woman did  what month did we meet him  well  i tell you it was just after we arrived  we arrived in june  and it was july  they were married in january of last year  yes  she is down in the morning room again  and i have no doubt she will see you  but you must not ask too much of her  for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand lady brackenstall was reclining on the same couch  but looked brighter than before  the maid had entered with us  and began once more to foment the bruise upon her mistress s brow i hope  said the lady  that you have not come to cross examine me again no  holmes answered  in his gentlest voice  i will not cause you any unnecessary trouble  lady brackenstall  and my whole desire is to make things easy for you  for i am convinced that you are a much tried woman if you will treat me as a friend and trust me  you may find that i will justify your trust what do you want me to do to tell me the truth mr  holmes no  no  lady brackenstall it is no use  you may have heard of any little reputation which i possess  i will stake it all on the fact that your story is an absolute fabrication mistress and maid were both staring at holmes with pale faces and frightened eyes you are an impudent fellow  cried theresa  do you mean to say that my mistress has told a lie holmes rose from his chair have you nothing to tell me i have told you everything think once more  lady brackenstall  would it not be better to be frank for an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face  then some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask i have told you all i know holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders  i am sorry  he said and without another word we left the room and the house  there was a pond in the park  and to this my friend led the way  it was frozen over  but a single hole was left for the convenience of a solitary swan  holmes gazed at it  and then passed on to the lodge gate  there he scribbled a short note for stanley hopkins  and left it with the lodge keeper it may be a hit  or it may be a miss  but we are bound to do something for friend hopkins  just to justify this second visit  said he  i will not quite take him into my confidence yet  i think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of the adelaide southampton line which stands at the end of pall mall  if i remember right  there is a second line of steamers which connect south australia with england  but we will draw the larger cover first holmes s card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention  and he was not long in acquiring all the information he needed  in june of  only one of their line had reached a home port  it was the rock of gibraltar  their largest and best boat  a reference to the passenger list showed that miss fraser  of adelaide  with her maid had made the voyage in her  the boat was now somewhere south of the suez canal on her way to australia  her officers were the same as in  with one exception  the first officer  mr  jack crocker  had been made a captain and was to take charge of their new ship  the bass rock  sailing in two days  time from southampton  he lived at sydenham  but he was likely to be in that morning for instructions  if we cared to wait for him no  mr  holmes had no desire to see him  but would be glad to know more about his record and character his record was magnificent  there was not an officer in the fleet to touch him  as to his character  he was reliable on duty  but a wild desperate fellow off the deck of his ship hot headed  excitable  but loyal  honest  and kind hearted  that was the pith of the information with which holmes left the office of the adelaide southampton company thence he drove to scotland yard  but  instead of entering  he sat in his cab with his brows drawn down  lost in profound thought  finally he drove round to the charing cross telegraph office  sent off a message and then  at last  we made for baker street once more no  i couldn t do it  watson  said he  as we reentered our room  once that warrant was made out  nothing on earth would save him  once or twice in my career i feel that i have done more real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done by his crime  i have learned caution now  and i had rather play tricks with the law of england than with my own conscience  let us know a little more before we act before evening  we had a visit from inspector stanley hopkins  things were not going very well with him i believe that you are a wizard  mr  holmes  i really do sometimes think that you have powers that are not human  now  how on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom of that pond i didn t know it but you told me to examine it you got it  then yes  i got it i am very glad if i have helped you but you haven t helped me  you have made the affair far more difficult what sort of burglars are they who steal silver and then throw it into the nearest pond it was certainly rather eccentric behaviour  i was merely going on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did not want it who merely took it for a blind  as it were then they would naturally be anxious to get rid of it but why should such an idea cross your mind well  i thought it was possible  when they came out through the french window  there was the pond with one tempting little hole in the ice right in front of their noses  could there be a better hiding place ah  a hiding place that is better  cried stanley hopkins  yes  yes i see it all now  it was early  there were folk upon the roads  they were afraid of being seen with the silver  so they sank it in the pond intending to return for it when the coast was clear  excellent  mr holmes that is better than your idea of a blind quite so  you have got an admirable theory  i have no doubt that my own ideas were quite wild  but you must admit that they have ended in discovering the silver yes  sir yes  it was all your doing  but i have had a bad setback a setback yes  mr  holmes  the randall gang were arrested in new york this morning dear me  hopkins  that is certainly rather against your theory that they committed a murder in kent last night it is fatal  mr  holmes absolutely fatal  still  there are other gangs of three besides the randalls  or it may be some new gang of which the police have never heard quite so  it is perfectly possible  what  are you off yes  mr  holmes  there is no rest for me until i have got to the bottom of the business  i suppose you have no hint to give me i have given you one which well  i suggested a blind but why  mr  holmes  why ah  that s the question  of course  but i commend the idea to your mind  you might possibly find that there was something in it  you won t stop for dinner  well  good bye  and let us know how you get on dinner was over  and the table cleared before holmes alluded to the matter again  he had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet to the cheerful blaze of the fire  suddenly he looked at his watch i expect developments  watson when now within a few minutes  i dare say you thought i acted rather badly to stanley hopkins just now i trust your judgment a very sensible reply  watson  you must look at it this way  what i know is unofficial  what he knows is official  i have the right to private judgment  but he has none  he must disclose all  or he is a traitor to his service  in a doubtful case i would not put him in so painful a position  and so i reserve my information until my own mind is clear upon the matter but when will that be the time has come  you will now be present at the last scene of a remarkable little drama there was a sound upon the stairs  and our door was opened to admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it  he was a very tall young man  golden moustached  blue eyed  with a skin which had been burned by tropical suns  and a springy step  which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong  he closed the door behind him  and then he stood with clenched hands and heaving breast  choking down some overmastering emotion sit down  captain crocker  you got my telegram our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the other of us with questioning eyes i got your telegram  and i came at the hour you said  i heard that you had been down to the office  there was no getting away from you  let s hear the worst  what are you going to do with me  arrest me  speak out man  you can t sit there and play with me like a cat with a mouse give him a cigar  said holmes  bite on that  captain crocker  and don t let your nerves run away with you  i should not sit here smoking with you if i thought that you were a common criminal  you may be sure of that  be frank with me and we may do some good  play tricks with me and i ll crush you what do you wish me to do to give me a true account of all that happened at the abbey grange last night a true account  mind you  with nothing added and nothing taken off  i know so much already that if you go one inch off the straight i ll blow this police whistle from my window and the affair goes out of my hands forever the sailor thought for a little  then he struck his leg with his great sunburned hand i ll chance it  he cried  i believe you are a man of your word  and a white man  and i ll tell you the whole story  but one thing i will say first  so far as i am concerned  i regret nothing and i fear nothing and i would do it all again and be proud of the job  damn the beast  if he had as many lives as a cat  he would owe them all to me  but it s the lady  mary mary fraser for never will i call her by that accursed name  when i think of getting her into trouble  i who would give my life just to bring one smile to her dear face  it s that that turns my soul into water  and yet and yet what less could i do  i ll tell you my story  gentlemen  and then i ll ask you  as man to man  what less could i do i must go back a bit  you seem to know everything  so i expect that you know that i met her when she was a passenger and i was first officer of the rock of gibraltar  from the first day i met her  she was the only woman to me  every day of that voyage i loved her more  and many a time since have i kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because i knew her dear feet had trod it  she was never engaged to me  she treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man  i have no complaint to make  it was all love on my side  and all good comradeship and friendship on hers  when we parted she was a free woman  but i could never again be a free man next time i came back from sea  i heard of her marriage  well  why shouldn t she marry whom she liked  title and money who could carry them better than she  she was born for all that is beautiful and dainty i didn t grieve over her marriage  i was not such a selfish hound as that  i just rejoiced that good luck had come her way  and that she had not thrown herself away on a penniless sailor  that s how i loved mary fraser well  i never thought to see her again  but last voyage i was promoted and the new boat was not yet launched  so i had to wait for a couple of months with my people at sydenham  one day out in a country lane i met theresa wright  her old maid  she told me all about her  about him about everything  i tell you  gentlemen  it nearly drove me mad  this drunken hound  that he should dare to raise his hand to her  whose boots he was not worthy to lick  i met theresa again  then i met mary herself and met her again  then she would meet me no more  but the other day i had a notice that i was to start on my voyage within a week and i determined that i would see her once before i left  theresa was always my friend  for she loved mary and hated this villain almost as much as i did  from her i learned the ways of the house  mary used to sit up reading in her own little room downstairs  i crept round there last night and scratched at the window  at first she would not open to me  but in her heart i know that now she loves me  and she could not leave me in the frosty night  she whispered to me to come round to the big front window  and i found it open before me  so as to let me into the dining room  again i heard from her own lips things that made my blood boil  and again i cursed this brute who mishandled the woman i loved  well  gentlemen  i was standing with her just inside the window in all innocence  as god is my judge  when he rushed like a madman into the room  called her the vilest name that a man could use to a woman and welted her across the face with the stick he had in his hand  i had sprung for the poker  and it was a fair fight between us  see here on my arm  where his first blow fell  then it was my turn  and i went through him as if he had been a rotten pumpkin  do you think i was sorry  not i  it was his life or mine  but far more than that  it was his life or hers  for how could i leave her in the power of this madman that was how i killed him  was i wrong  well  then  what would either of you gentlemen have done  if you had been in my position she had screamed when he struck her  and that brought old theresa down from the room above  there was a bottle of wine on the sideboard  and i opened it and poured a little between mary s lips  for she was half dead with shock  then i took a drop myself  theresa was as cool as ice  and it was her plot as much as mine  we must make it appear that burglars had done the thing  theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress while i swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell  then i lashed her in her chair  and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look natural else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could have got up there to cut it  then i gathered up a few plates and pots of silver  to carry out the idea of the robbery  and there i left them  with orders to give the alarm when i had a quarter of an hour s start  i dropped the silver into the pond  and made off for sydenham  feeling that for once in my life i had done a real good night s work  and that s the truth and the whole truth  mr  holmes  if it costs me my neck holmes smoked for some time in silence  then he crossed the room  and shook our visitor by the hand that s what i think  said he  i know that every word is true  for you have hardly said a word which i did not know  no one but an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bell rope from the bracket  and no one but a sailor could have made the knots with which the cord was fastened to the chair  only once had this lady been brought into contact with sailors  and that was on her voyage  and it was someone of her own class of life  since she was trying hard to shield him  and so showing that she loved him  you see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once i had started upon the right trail i thought the police never could have seen through our dodge and the police haven t  nor will they  to the best of my belief  now look here  captain crocker  this is a very serious matter  though i am willing to admit that you acted under the most extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected  i am not sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be pronounced legitimate  however  that is for a british jury to decide  meanwhile i have so much sympathy for you that  if you choose to disappear in the next twenty four hours  i will promise you that no one will hinder you and then it will all come out certainly it will come out the sailor flushed with anger what sort of proposal is that to make a man  i know enough of law to understand that mary would be held as accomplice  do you think i would leave her alone to face the music while i slunk away  no  sir  let them do their worst upon me  but for heaven s sake  mr  holmes  find some way of keeping my poor mary out of the courts holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor i was only testing you  and you ring true every time  well  it is a great responsibility that i take upon myself  but i have given hopkins an excellent hint and if he can t avail himself of it i can do no more see here  captain crocker  we ll do this in due form of law  you are the prisoner  watson  you are a british jury  and i never met a man who was more eminently fitted to represent one  i am the judge  now  gentleman of the jury  you have heard the evidence  do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty not guilty  my lord  said i vox populi  vox dei  you are acquitted  captain crocker  so long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from me  come back to this lady in a year  and may her future and yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this night the adventure of the second stain i had intended the adventure of the abbey grange  to be the last of those exploits of my friend  mr  sherlock holmes  which i should ever communicate to the public  this resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material  since i have notes of many hundreds of cases to which i have never alluded  nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man  the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences so long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him  but since he has definitely retired from london and betaken himself to study and bee farming on the sussex downs  notoriety has become hateful to him and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed  it was only upon my representing to him that i had given a promise that the adventure of the second stain  should be published when the times were ripe  and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle  that i at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public  if in telling the story i seem to be somewhat vague in certain details  the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence it was  then  in a year  and even in a decade  that shall be nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of european fame within the walls of our humble room in baker street  the one  austere  high nosed  eagle eyed  and dominant  was none other than the illustrious lord bellinger  twice premier of britain  the other dark  clear cut  and elegant  hardly yet of middle age  and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind  was the right honourable trelawney hope  secretary for european affairs  and the most rising statesman in the country  they sat side by side upon our paper littered settee and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them  the premier s thin  blue veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella  and his gaunt  ascetic face looked gloomily from holmes to me  the european secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch chain when i discovered my loss  mr  holmes  which was at eight o clock this morning  i at once informed the prime minister  it was at his suggestion that we have both come to you have you informed the police no  sir  said the prime minister  with the quick  decisive manner for which he was famous  we have not done so  nor is it possible that we should do so  to inform the police must  in the long run  mean to inform the public  this is what we particularly desire to avoid and why  sir because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily i might almost say probably lead to european complications of the utmost moment  it is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue  unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy  then it may as well not be recovered at all  for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known i understand  now  mr  trelawney hope  i should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared that can be done in a very few words  mr  holmes  the letter for it was a letter from a foreign potentate was received six days ago  it was of such importance that i have never left it in my safe  but have taken it across each evening to my house in whitehall terrace  and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch box  it was there last night  of that i am certain  i actually opened the box while i was dressing for dinner and saw the document inside  this morning it was gone  the despatch box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing table all night  i am a light sleeper  and so is my wife  we are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night  and yet i repeat that the paper is gone what time did you dine half past seven how long was it before you went to bed my wife had gone to the theatre  i waited up for her  it was half past eleven before we went to our room then for four hours the despatch box had lain unguarded no one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house maid in the morning  and my valet  or my wife s maid  during the rest of the day they are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time besides  neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch box who did know of the existence of that letter no one in the house surely your wife knew no  sir  i had said nothing to my wife until i missed the paper this morning the premier nodded approvingly i have long known  sir  how high is your sense of public duty  said he  i am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties the european secretary bowed you do me no more than justice  sir  until this morning i have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter could she have guessed no  mr  holmes  she could not have guessed nor could anyone have guessed have you lost any documents before no  sir who is there in england who did know of the existence of this letter each member of the cabinet was informed of it yesterday  but the pledge of secrecy which attends every cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the prime minister  good heavens to think that within a few hours i should myself have lost it  his handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair  and his hands tore at his hair  for a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man impulsive  ardent  keenly sensitive  the next the aristocratic mask was replaced  and the gentle voice had returned  besides the members of the cabinet there are two  or possibly three  departmental officials who know of the letter  no one else in england  mr  holmes  i assure you but abroad i believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it  i am well convinced that his ministers that the usual official channels have not been employed holmes considered for some little time now  sir  i must ask you more particularly what this document is  and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences the two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the premier s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown mr  holmes  the envelope is a long  thin one of pale blue colour  there is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion  it is addressed in large  bold handwriting to i fear  sir  said holmes  that  interesting and indeed essential as these details are  my inquiries must go more to the root of things  what was the letter that is a state secret of the utmost importance  and i fear that i cannot tell you  nor do i see that it is necessary  if by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as i describe with its enclosure  you will have deserved well of your country  and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow sherlock holmes rose with a smile you are two of the most busy men in the country  said he  and in my own small way i have also a good many calls upon me  i regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter  and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time the premier sprang to his feet with that quick  fierce gleam of his deep set eyes before which a cabinet has cowered  i am not accustomed sir  he began  but mastered his anger and resumed his seat  for a minute or more we all sat in silence  then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders we must accept your terms  mr  holmes  no doubt you are right  and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence i agree with you  said the younger statesman then i will tell you  relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague  dr  watson  i may appeal to your patriotism also  for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out you may safely trust us the letter  then  is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this country  it has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely inquiries have shown that his ministers know nothing of the matter at the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner  and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character  that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country  there would be such a ferment  sir  that i do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the premier exactly  it was he  and it is this letter this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion have you informed the sender yes  sir  a cipher telegram has been despatched perhaps he desires the publication of the letter no  sir  we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot headed manner  it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out if this is so  whose interest is it that the letter should come out why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it there  mr  holmes  you take me into regions of high international politics  but if you consider the european situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive  the whole of europe is an armed camp  there is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power  great britain holds the scales  if britain were driven into war with one confederacy  it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy  whether they joined in the war or not  do you follow very clearly  it is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter  so as to make a breach between his country and ours yes  sir and to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy to any of the great chancelleries of europe  it is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it mr  trelawney hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud  the premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder it is your misfortune  my dear fellow  no one can blame you  there is no precaution which you have neglected  now  mr  holmes  you are in full possession of the facts  what course do you recommend holmes shook his head mournfully you think  sir  that unless this document is recovered there will be war i think it is very probable then  sir  prepare for war that is a hard saying  mr  holmes consider the facts  sir  it is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven thirty at night  since i understand that mr  hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out it was taken  then  yesterday evening between seven thirty and eleven thirty  probably near the earlier hour  since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible  now  sir  if a document of this importance were taken at that hour  where can it be now  no one has any reason to retain it  it has been passed rapidly on to those who need it  what chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it  it is beyond our reach the prime minister rose from the settee what you say is perfectly logical  mr  holmes  i feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands let us presume  for argument s sake  that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet they are both old and tried servants i understand you to say that your room is on the second floor  that there is no entrance from without  and that from within no one could go up unobserved  it must  then  be somebody in the house who has taken it to whom would the thief take it  to one of several international spies and secret agents  whose names are tolerably familiar to me  there are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession  i will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post if one is missing especially if he has disappeared since last night we will have some indication as to where the document has gone why should he be missing  asked the european secretary  he would take the letter to an embassy in london  as likely as not i fancy not  these agents work independently  and their relations with the embassies are often strained the prime minister nodded his acquiescence i believe you are right  mr  holmes  he would take so valuable a prize to headquarters with his own hands  i think that your course of action is an excellent one  meanwhile  hope  we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune  should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you  and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries the two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room when our illustrious visitors had departed holmes lit his pipe in silence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought  i had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in london the night before  when my friend gave an exclamation sprang to his feet  and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece yes  said he  there is no better way of approaching it  the situation is desperate  but not hopeless  even now  if we could be sure which of them has taken it  it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands  after all  it is a question of money with these fellows  and i have the british treasury behind me  if it s on the market i ll buy it if it means another penny on the income tax  it is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other  there are only those three capable of playing so bold a game there are oberstein  la rothiere  and eduardo lucas  i will see each of them i glanced at my morning paper is that eduardo lucas of godolphin street yes you will not see him why not he was murdered in his house last night my friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that i realized how completely i had astonished him  he stared in amazement  and then snatched the paper from my hands  this was the paragraph which i had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair murder in westminster a crime of mysterious character was committed last night at  godolphin street  one of the old fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth century houses which lie between the river and the abbey  almost in the shadow of the great tower of the houses of parliament  this small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by mr  eduardo lucas  well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country  mr  lucas is an unmarried man thirty four years of age  and his establishment consists of mrs pringle  an elderly housekeeper  and of mitton  his valet  the former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house  the valet was out for the evening  visiting a friend at hammersmith  from ten o clock onward mr  lucas had the house to himself  what occurred during that time has not yet transpired  but at a quarter to twelve police constable barrett passing along godolphin street observed that the door of no   was ajar  he knocked  but received no answer  perceiving a light in the front room  he advanced into the passage and again knocked  but without reply  he then pushed open the door and entered  the room was in a state of wild disorder  the furniture being all swept to one side  and one chair lying on its back in the centre  beside this chair  and still grasping one of its legs  lay the unfortunate tenant of the house  he had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly  the knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved indian dagger plucked down from a trophy of oriental arms which adorned one of the walls  robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime  for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room mr  eduardo lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a widespread circle of friends well  watson  what do you make of this  asked holmes  after a long pause it is an amazing coincidence a coincidence  here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama  and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted  the odds are enormous against its being coincidence  no figures could express them no  my dear watson  the two events are connected must be connected  it is for us to find the connection but now the official police must know all not at all  they know all they see at godolphin street  they know and shall know nothing of whitehall terrace  only we know of both events and can trace the relation between them  there is one obvious point which would  in any case  have turned my suspicions against lucas godolphin street  westminster  is only a few minutes  walk from whitehall terrace  the other secret agents whom i have named live in the extreme west end  it was easier  therefore  for lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the european secretary s household a small thing  and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential  halloa  what have we here mrs  hudson had appeared with a lady s card upon her salver  holmes glanced at it  raised his eyebrows  and handed it over to me ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step up said he a moment later our modest apartment  already so distinguished that morning  was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in london  i had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the duke of belminster  but no description of it  and no contemplation of colourless photographs  had prepared me for the subtle  delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head  and yet as we saw it that autumn morning  it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer  the cheek was lovely but it was paled with emotion  the eyes were bright but it was the brightness of fever  the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self command  terror not beauty was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door has my husband been here  mr  holmes yes  madam  he has been here mr  holmes  i implore you not to tell him that i came here  holmes bowed coldly  and motioned the lady to a chair your ladyship places me in a very delicate position  i beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire  but i fear that i cannot make any unconditional promise she swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window  it was a queenly presence tall  graceful  and intensely womanly  mr  holmes  she said and her white gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke i will speak frankly to you in the hopes that it may induce you to speak frankly in return  there is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one  that one is politics  on this his lips are sealed  he tells me nothing  now  i am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night  i know that a paper has disappeared  but because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence now it is essential essential  i say that i should thoroughly understand it  you are the only other person  save only these politicians  who knows the true facts  i beg you then  mr  holmes  to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to  tell me all mr  holmes  let no regard for your client s interests keep you silent for i assure you that his interests  if he would only see it  would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence  what was this paper which was stolen madam  what you ask me is really impossible she groaned and sank her face in her hands you must see that this is so  madam  if your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter  is it for me  who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy  to tell what he has withheld  it is not fair to ask it  it is him whom you must ask i have asked him  i come to you as a last resource  but without your telling me anything definite  mr  holmes  you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point what is it  madam is my husband s political career likely to suffer through this incident well  madam  unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect ah  she drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved one more question  mr  holmes  from an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster i understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document if he said so  i certainly cannot deny it of what nature are they nay  madam  there again you ask me more than i can possibly answer then i will take up no more of your time  i cannot blame you  mr holmes  for having refused to speak more freely  and you on your side will not  i am sure  think the worse of me because i desire  even against his will  to share my husband s anxieties  once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit she looked back at us from the door  and i had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face  the startled eyes  and the drawn mouth  then she was gone now  watson  the fair sex is your department  said holmes  with a smile  when the dwindling frou frou of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door  what was the fair lady s game  what did she really want surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural hum  think of her appearance  watson her manner  her suppressed excitement  her restlessness  her tenacity in asking questions  remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion she was certainly much moved remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all  what did she mean by that  and you must have observed  watson  how she manoeuvred to have the light at her back  she did not wish us to read her expression yes  she chose the one chair in the room and yet the motives of women are so inscrutable  you remember the woman at margate whom i suspected for the same reason  no powder on her nose that proved to be the correct solution  how can you build on such a quicksand  their most trivial action may mean volumes  or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tongs good morning  watson you are off yes  i will while away the morning at godolphin street with our friends of the regular establishment  with eduardo lucas lies the solution of our problem  though i must admit that i have not an inkling as to what form it may take  it is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts  do you stay on guard  my good watson  and receive any fresh visitors  i ll join you at lunch if i am able all that day and the next and the next holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn  and others morose  he ran out and ran in smoked incessantly  played snatches on his violin  sank into reveries devoured sandwiches at irregular hours  and hardly answered the casual questions which i put to him  it was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest  he would say nothing of the case  and it was from the papers that i learned the particulars of the inquest and the arrest with the subsequent release of john mitton  the valet of the deceased  the coroner s jury brought in the obvious wilful murder but the parties remained as unknown as ever  no motive was suggested the room was full of articles of value  but none had been taken  the dead man s papers had not been tampered with  they were carefully examined  and showed that he was a keen student of international politics  an indefatigable gossip  a remarkable linguist  and an untiring letter writer  he had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries  but nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers  as to his relations with women  they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial  he had many acquaintances among them  but few friends  and no one whom he loved  his habits were regular  his conduct inoffensive  his death was an absolute mystery and likely to remain so as to the arrest of john mitton  the valet  it was a council of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction  but no case could be sustained against him  he had visited friends in hammersmith that night  the alibi was complete  it is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to westminster before the time when the crime was discovered  but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night  he had actually arrived at twelve o clock  and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy  he had always been on good terms with his master  several of the dead man s possessions notably a small case of razors had been found in the valet s boxes  but he explained that they had been presents from the deceased  and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story  mitton had been in lucas s employment for three years  it was noticeable that lucas did not take mitton on the continent with him  sometimes he visited paris for three months on end  but mitton was left in charge of the godolphin street house  as to the housekeeper she had heard nothing on the night of the crime  if her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him so for three mornings the mystery remained  so far as i could follow it in the papers  if holmes knew more  he kept his own counsel  but  as he told me that inspector lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case  i knew that he was in close touch with every development  upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from paris which seemed to solve the whole question a discovery has just been made by the parisian police said the daily telegraph  which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of mr  eduardo lucas  who met his death by violence last monday night at godolphin street  westminster  our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room  and that some suspicion attached to his valet  but that the case broke down on an alibi  yesterday a lady  who has been known as mme  henri fournaye occupying a small villa in the rue austerlitz  was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane  an examination showed she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form on inquiry  the police have discovered that mme  henri fournaye only returned from a journey to london on tuesday last  and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at westminster  a comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that m  henri fournaye and eduardo lucas were really one and the same person  and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in london and paris  mme  fournaye who is of creole origin  is of an extremely excitable nature  and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy  it is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in london  her movements upon the monday night have not yet been traced  but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at charing cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures  it is probable therefore  that the crime was either committed when insane  or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind  at present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past  and the doctors hold out no hopes of the reestablishment of her reason  there is evidence that a woman  who might have been mme  fournaye  was seen for some hours upon monday night watching the house in godolphin street what do you think of that  holmes  i had read the account aloud to him  while he finished his breakfast my dear watson  said he  as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room  you are most long suffering  but if i have told you nothing in the last three days  it is because there is nothing to tell even now this report from paris does not help us much surely it is final as regards the man s death the man s death is a mere incident a trivial episode in comparison with our real task  which is to trace this document and save a european catastrophe  only one important thing has happened in the last three days  and that is that nothing has happened  i get reports almost hourly from the government  and it is certain that nowhere in europe is there any sign of trouble  now  if this letter were loose no  it can t be loose but if it isn t loose  where can it be  who has it  why is it held back  that s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer  was it  indeed  a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared  did the letter ever reach him  if so  why is it not among his papers  did this mad wife of his carry it off with her  if so  is it in her house in paris  how could i search for it without the french police having their suspicions aroused  it is a case my dear watson  where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are  every man s hand is against us  and yet the interests at stake are colossal  should i bring it to a successful conclusion  it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career  ah  here is my latest from the front  he glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in  halloa  lestrade seems to have observed something of interest  put on your hat  watson  and we will stroll down together to westminster it was my first visit to the scene of the crime a high  dingy narrow chested house  prim  formal  and solid  like the century which gave it birth  lestrade s bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window  and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in  the room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed  but no trace of it now remained save an ugly  irregular stain upon the carpet  this carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room  surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful  old fashioned wood flooring in square blocks  highly polished  over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons  one of which had been used on that tragic night  in the window was a sumptuous writing desk  and every detail of the apartment  the pictures  the rugs and the hangings  all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy seen the paris news  asked lestrade holmes nodded our french friends seem to have touched the spot this time  no doubt it s just as they say  she knocked at the door surprise visit  i guess  for he kept his life in water tight compartments he let her in couldn t keep her in the street  she told him how she had traced him reproached him  one thing led to another  and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came  it wasn t all done in an instant  though  for these chairs were all swept over yonder  and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it  we ve got it all clear as if we had seen it holmes raised his eyebrows and yet you have sent for me ah  yes  that s another matter a mere trifle  but the sort of thing you take an interest in queer  you know  and what you might call freakish  it has nothing to do with the main fact can t have  on the face of it what is it  then well  you know  after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position  nothing has been moved  officer in charge here day and night  this morning  as the man was buried and the investigation over so far as this room is concerned we thought we could tidy up a bit  this carpet  you see  it is not fastened down  only just laid there  we had occasion to raise it  we found yes  you found holmes s face grew tense with anxiety well  i m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find  you see that stain on the carpet  well  a great deal must have soaked through  must it not undoubtedly it must well  you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond no stain  but there must yes  so you would say  but the fact remains that there isn t he took the corner of the carpet in his hand and  turning it over  he showed that it was indeed as he said but the under side is as stained as the upper  it must have left a mark lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert now  i ll show you the explanation  there is a second stain  but it does not correspond with the other  see for yourself  as he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet  and there  sure enough  was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old fashioned floor  what do you make of that  mr  holmes why  it is simple enough  the two stains did correspond  but the carpet has been turned round  as it was square and unfastened it was easily done the official police don t need you  mr  holmes  to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round  that s clear enough  for the stains lie above each other if you lay it over this way  but what i want to know is  who shifted the carpet  and why i could see from holmes s rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement look here  lestrade  said he  has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time yes  he has well  take my advice  examine him carefully  don t do it before us we ll wait here  you take him into the back room  you ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone  ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room  don t ask him if he has done it  take it for granted  tell him you know someone has been here  press him  tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness do exactly what i tell you by george  if he knows i ll have it out of him  cried lestrade  he darted into the hall  and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room now  watson  now  cried holmes with frenzied eagerness  all the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy  he tore the drugget from the floor  and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it  one turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it  it hinged back like the lid of a box  a small black cavity opened beneath it  holmes plunged his eager hand into it and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment  it was empty quick  watson  quick  get it back again  the wooden lid was replaced and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when lestrade s voice was heard in the passage  he found holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece  resigned and patient  endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns sorry to keep you waiting  mr  holmes  i can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair  well  he has confessed  all right  come in here  macpherson  let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct the big constable  very hot and penitent  sidled into the room i meant no harm  sir  i m sure  the young woman came to the door last evening mistook the house  she did  and then we got talking  it s lonesome  when you re on duty here all day well  what happened then she wanted to see where the crime was done had read about it in the papers  she said  she was a very respectable  well spoken young woman sir  and i saw no harm in letting her have a peep  when she saw that mark on the carpet  down she dropped on the floor  and lay as if she were dead  i ran to the back and got some water  but i could not bring her to  then i went round the corner to the ivy plant for some brandy and by the time i had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off ashamed of herself  i daresay  and dared not face me how about moving that drugget well  sir  it was a bit rumpled  certainly  when i came back  you see she fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place  i straightened it out afterwards it s a lesson to you that you can t deceive me  constable macpherson said lestrade  with dignity  no doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered  and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room it s lucky for you  my man  that nothing is missing  or you would find yourself in queer street  i m sorry to have called you down over such a petty business  mr  holmes  but i thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you certainly  it was most interesting  has this woman only been here once constable yes  sir  only once who was she don t know the name  sir  was answering an advertisement about typewriting and came to the wrong number very pleasant  genteel young woman  sir tall  handsome yes  sir  she was a well grown young woman  i suppose you might say she was handsome  perhaps some would say she was very handsome  oh officer  do let me have a peep  says she  she had pretty  coaxing ways as you might say  and i thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door how was she dressed quiet  sir a long mantle down to her feet what time was it it was just growing dusk at the time  they were lighting the lamps as i came back with the brandy very good  said holmes  come  watson  i think that we have more important work elsewhere as we left the house lestrade remained in the front room  while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out  holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand  the constable stared intently good lord  sir  he cried  with amazement on his face  holmes put his finger on his lips  replaced his hand in his breast pocket  and burst out laughing as we turned down the street  excellent  said he  come friend watson  the curtain rings up for the last act  you will be relieved to hear that there will be no war  that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no setback in his brilliant career  that the indiscreet sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion that the prime minister will have no european complication to deal with  and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident my mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man you have solved it  i cried hardly that  watson  there are some points which are as dark as ever but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest  we will go straight to whitehall terrace and bring the matter to a head when we arrived at the residence of the european secretary it was for lady hilda trelawney hope that sherlock holmes inquired  we were shown into the morning room mr  holmes  said the lady  and her face was pink with her indignation this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part  i desired as i have explained  to keep my visit to you a secret  lest my husband should think that i was intruding into his affairs  and yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us unfortunately  madam  i had no possible alternative  i have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper  i must therefore ask you  madam  to be kind enough to place it in my hands the lady sprang to her feet  with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face  her eyes glazed she tottered i thought that she would faint  then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features you you insult me  mr  holmes come  come  madam  it is useless  give up the letter she darted to the bell the butler shall show you out do not ring  lady hilda  if you do  then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated  give up the letter and all will be set right  if you will work with me i can arrange everything  if you work against me i must expose you she stood grandly defiant  a queenly figure  her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul  her hand was on the bell  but she had forborne to ring it you are trying to frighten me  it is not a very manly thing  mr holmes  to come here and browbeat a woman  you say that you know something  what is it that you know pray sit down  madam  you will hurt yourself there if you fall  i will not speak until you sit down  thank you i give you five minutes  mr  holmes one is enough  lady hilda  i know of your visit to eduardo lucas  of your giving him this document  of your ingenious return to the room last night  and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding place under the carpet she stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak you are mad  mr  holmes you are mad  she cried  at last he drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket  it was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait i have carried this because i thought it might be useful  said he the policeman has recognized it she gave a gasp  and her head dropped back in the chair come  lady hilda  you have the letter  the matter may still be adjusted  i have no desire to bring trouble to you  my duty ends when i have returned the lost letter to your husband  take my advice and be frank with me  it is your only chance her courage was admirable  even now she would not own defeat i tell you again  mr  holmes  that you are under some absurd illusion holmes rose from his chair i am sorry for you  lady hilda  i have done my best for you  i can see that it is all in vain he rang the bell  the butler entered is mr  trelawney hope at home he will be home  sir  at a quarter to one holmes glanced at his watch still a quarter of an hour  said he  very good  i shall wait the butler had hardly closed the door behind him when lady hilda was down on her knees at holmes s feet  her hands outstretched  her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears oh  spare me  mr  holmes  spare me  she pleaded  in a frenzy of supplication  for heaven s sake  don t tell him  i love him so  i would not bring one shadow on his life  and this i know would break his noble heart holmes raised the lady  i am thankful  madam  that you have come to your senses even at this last moment  there is not an instant to lose where is the letter she darted across to a writing desk  unlocked it  and drew out a long blue envelope here it is  mr  holmes  would to heaven i had never seen it how can we return it  holmes muttered  quick  quick  we must think of some way  where is the despatch box still in his bedroom what a stroke of luck  quick  madam  bring it here  a moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand how did you open it before  you have a duplicate key  yes  of course you have  open it from out of her bosom lady hilda had drawn a small key  the box flew open  it was stuffed with papers  holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them  between the leaves of some other document the box was shut  locked  and returned to the bedroom now we are ready for him  said holmes  we have still ten minutes i am going far to screen you  lady hilda  in return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair mr  holmes  i will tell you everything  cried the lady  oh  mr holmes  i would cut off my right hand before i gave him a moment of sorrow  there is no woman in all london who loves her husband as i do  and yet if he knew how i have acted how i have been compelled to act he would never forgive me  for his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another  help me  mr  holmes my happiness  his happiness  our very lives are at stake quick  madam  the time grows short it was a letter of mine  mr  holmes  an indiscreet letter written before my marriage a foolish letter  a letter of an impulsive  loving girl  i meant no harm  and yet he would have thought it criminal  had he read that letter his confidence would have been forever destroyed  it is years since i wrote it  i had thought that the whole matter was forgotten  then at last i heard from this man  lucas  that it had passed into his hands  and that he would lay it before my husband  i implored his mercy  he said that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband s despatch box  he had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence  he assured me that no harm could come to my husband  put yourself in my position  mr holmes  what was i to do take your husband into your confidence i could not  mr  holmes  i could not  on the one side seemed certain ruin  on the other  terrible as it seemed to take my husband s paper still in a matter of politics i could not understand the consequences while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me  i did it  mr  holmes  i took an impression of his key  this man  lucas furnished a duplicate  i opened his despatch box  took the paper  and conveyed it to godolphin street what happened there  madam i tapped at the door as agreed  lucas opened it  i followed him into his room  leaving the hall door ajar behind me  for i feared to be alone with the man  i remember that there was a woman outside as i entered our business was soon done  he had my letter on his desk  i handed him the document  he gave me the letter  at this instant there was a sound at the door  there were steps in the passage  lucas quickly turned back the drugget  thrust the document into some hiding place there  and covered it over what happened after that is like some fearful dream  i have a vision of a dark  frantic face  of a woman s voice  which screamed in french  my waiting is not in vain  at last  at last i have found you with her there was a savage struggle  i saw him with a chair in his hand  a knife gleamed in hers  i rushed from the horrible scene  ran from the house and only next morning in the paper did i learn the dreadful result  that night i was happy  for i had my letter  and i had not seen yet what the future would bring it was the next morning that i realized that i had only exchanged one trouble for another  my husband s anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart  i could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what i had done  but that again would mean a confession of the past  i came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence  from the instant that i grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband s paper  it must still be where lucas had placed it  for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room  if it had not been for her coming  i should not have known where his hiding place was how was i to get into the room  for two days i watched the place  but the door was never left open  last night i made a last attempt  what i did and how i succeeded  you have already learned  i brought the paper back with me  and thought of destroying it  since i could see no way of returning it without confessing my guilt to my husband  heavens  i hear his step upon the stair the european secretary burst excitedly into the room  any news  mr holmes  any news  he cried i have some hopes ah  thank heaven  his face became radiant  the prime minister is lunching with me  may he share your hopes  he has nerves of steel  and yet i know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event  jacobs will you ask the prime minister to come up  as to you  dear  i fear that this is a matter of politics  we will join you in a few minutes in the dining room the prime minister s manner was subdued  but i could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague i understand that you have something to report  mr  holmes purely negative as yet  my friend answered  i have inquired at every point where it might be  and i am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended but that is not enough  mr  holmes  we cannot live forever on such a volcano  we must have something definite i am in hopes of getting it  that is why i am here  the more i think of the matter the more convinced i am that the letter has never left this house mr  holmes if it had it would certainly have been public by now but why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house i am not convinced that anyone did take it then how could it leave the despatch box i am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch box mr  holmes  this joking is very ill timed  you have my assurance that it left the box have you examined the box since tuesday morning no  it was not necessary you may conceivably have overlooked it impossible  i say but i am not convinced of it  i have known such things to happen  i presume there are other papers there  well  it may have got mixed with them it was on the top someone may have shaken the box and displaced it no  no  i had everything out surely it is easily decided  hope  said the premier  let us have the despatch box brought in the secretary rang the bell jacobs  bring down my despatch box  this is a farcical waste of time but still  if nothing else will satisfy you  it shall be done  thank you  jacobs  put it here  i have always had the key on my watch chain here are the papers  you see  letter from lord merrow  report from sir charles hardy  memorandum from belgrade  note on the russo german grain taxes  letter from madrid  note from lord flowers good heavens  what is this  lord bellinger  lord bellinger the premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand yes  it is it and the letter is intact  hope  i congratulate you thank you  thank you  what a weight from my heart  but this is inconceivable impossible  mr  holmes  you are a wizard  a sorcerer  how did you know it was there because i knew it was nowhere else i cannot believe my eyes  he ran wildly to the door  where is my wife  i must tell her that all is well  hilda  hilda  we heard his voice on the stairs the premier looked at holmes with twinkling eyes come  sir  said he  there is more in this than meets the eye  how came the letter back in the box holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes we also have our diplomatic secrets  said he and  picking up his hat he turned to the door the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of the return of sherlock holmes by arthur conan doyle  end of this project gutenberg ebook the return of sherlock holmes  this file should be named txt

and poverty exist on earth  books of the nature of les miserables cannot fail to be of use hauteville house  fantine book first a just man chapter i m  myriel in  m  charles francois bienvenu myriel was bishop of d  he was an old man of about seventy five years of age  he had occupied the see of d  since although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate  it will not be superfluous  if merely for the sake of exactness in all points  to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese  true or false  that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives  and above all in their destinies  as that which they do  m  myriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of aix  hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar  it was said that his father  destining him to be the heir of his own post  had married him at a very early age  eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families  in spite of this marriage  however  it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk  he was well formed though rather short in stature  elegant  graceful  intelligent  the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry the revolution came  events succeeded each other with precipitation  the parliamentary families  decimated  pursued  hunted down  were dispersed m  charles myriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution  there his wife died of a malady of the chest  from which she had long suffered  he had no children  what took place next in the fate of m  myriel  the ruin of the french society of the olden days  the fall of his own family  the tragic spectacles of  which were  perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powers of terror did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him  was he  in the midst of these distractions  these affections which absorbed his life  suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm  by striking to his heart  a man whom public catastrophes would not shake  by striking at his existence and his fortune  no one could have told  all that was known was  that when he returned from italy he was a priest in  m  myriel was the cure of b  brignolles  he was already advanced in years  and lived in a very retired manner about the epoch of the coronation  some petty affair connected with his curacy just what  is not precisely known took him to paris among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was m  le cardinal fesch  one day  when the emperor had come to visit his uncle  the worthy cure  who was waiting in the anteroom  found himself present when his majesty passed  napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man turned round and said abruptly who is this good man who is staring at me sire  said m  myriel  you are looking at a good man  and i at a great man  each of us can profit by it that very evening  the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m  myriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of d what truth was there  after all  in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m  myriel s life  no one knew  very few families had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution m  myriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk  and very few heads which think he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop  and because he was a bishop  but after all  the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise  sayings  words  less than words palabres  as the energetic language of the south expresses it however that may be  after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in d  all the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion  no one would have dared to mention them  no one would have dared to recall them m  myriel had arrived at d  accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptistine  who was his sister  and ten years his junior their only domestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptistine  and named madame magloire  who  after having been the servant of m  le cure  now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur mademoiselle baptistine was a long  pale  thin  gentle creature  she realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable  for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable  she had never been pretty  her whole life  which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds  had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency  and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness  what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity  and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen  she was a soul rather than a virgin  her person seemed made of a shadow  there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex  a little matter enclosing a light  large eyes forever drooping a mere pretext for a soul s remaining on the earth madame magloire was a little  fat  white old woman  corpulent and bustling  always out of breath in the first place  because of her activity  and in the next  because of her asthma on his arrival  m  myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees  which class a bishop immediately after a major general  the mayor and the president paid the first call on him  and he  in turn  paid the first call on the general and the prefect the installation over  the town waited to see its bishop at work chapter ii m  myriel becomes m  welcome the episcopal palace of d  adjoins the hospital the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house  built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m  henri puget  doctor of theology of the faculty of paris  abbe of simore  who had been bishop of d  in  this palace was a genuine seignorial residence  everything about it had a grand air the apartments of the bishop  the drawing rooms the chambers  the principal courtyard  which was very large  with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion  and gardens planted with magnificent trees  in the dining room  a long and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the gardens  m  henri puget had entertained in state  on july   my lords charles brulart de genlis  archbishop  prince d embrun  antoine de mesgrigny  the capuchin  bishop of grasse  philippe de vendome  grand prior of france  abbe of saint honore de lerins  francois de berton de crillon  bishop  baron de vence  cesar de sabran de forcalquier  bishop seignor of glandeve  and jean soanen  priest of the oratory  preacher in ordinary to the king  bishop  seignor of senez  the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment  and this memorable date  the th of july   was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story  with a small garden three days after his arrival  the bishop visited the hospital  the visit ended  he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house monsieur the director of the hospital  said he to him  how many sick people have you at the present moment twenty six  monseigneur that was the number which i counted  said the bishop the beds  pursued the director  are very much crowded against each other that is what i observed the halls are nothing but rooms  and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them so it seems to me and then  when there is a ray of sun  the garden is very small for the convalescents that was what i said to myself in case of epidemics we have had the typhus fever this year  we had the sweating sickness two years ago  and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do that is the thought which occurred to me what would you have  monseigneur  said the director  one must resign one s self this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor the bishop remained silent for a moment  then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital monsieur  said he  how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold monseigneur s dining room  exclaimed the stupefied director the bishop cast a glance round the apartment  and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes it would hold full twenty beds  said he  as though speaking to himself  then  raising his voice hold  monsieur the director of the hospital  i will tell you something there is evidently a mistake here  there are thirty six of you  in five or six small rooms  there are three of us here  and we have room for sixty  there is some mistake  i tell you  you have my house  and i have yours  give me back my house  you are at home here on the following day the thirty six patients were installed in the bishop s palace  and the bishop was settled in the hospital m  myriel had no property  his family having been ruined by the revolution  his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs  which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage  m  myriel received from the state  in his quality of bishop  a salary of fifteen thousand francs  on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital  m  myriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all  in the following manner  we transcribe here a note made by his own hand note on the regulation of my household expenses   for the little seminary                   livres   society of the  mission                         for the lazarists of montdidier                     seminary for foreign missions in paris                  congregation of the holy spirit                     religious establishments of the holy land                charitable maternity societies                      extra  for that of

    addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the        diocese                             public granary of the hautes alpes                    congregation of the ladies of d  of manosque  and of        sisteron  for the gratuitous instruction of poor        girls                              for the poor                             my personal expenses                                                                                      total                           m  myriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of d  as has been seen  he called it regulating his household expenses this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptistine  this holy woman regarded monseigneur of d  as at one and the same time her brother and her bishop  her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church  she simply loved and venerated him  when he spoke  she bowed  when he acted  she yielded her adherence  their only servant  madame magloire  grumbled a little  it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres  which  added to the pension of mademoiselle baptistine  made fifteen hundred francs a year  on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted and when a village curate came to d  the bishop still found means to entertain him  thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire  and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptistine one day  after he had been in d  about three months  the bishop said and still i am quite cramped with it all i should think so  exclaimed madame magloire  monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town  and for his journeys about the diocese  it was customary for bishops in former days hold  cried the bishop  you are quite right  madame magloire and he made his demand some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration  and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading  allowance to m  the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting  and expenses of pastoral visits this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses  and a senator of the empire  a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the  brumaire  and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of d  wrote to m bigot de preameneu  the minister of public worship  a very angry and confidential note on the subject  from which we extract these authentic lines expenses of carriage  what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants  expenses of journeys  what is the use of these trips  in the first place  next  how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts  there are no roads  no one travels otherwise than on horseback  even the bridge between durance and chateau arnoux can barely support ox teams  these priests are all thus greedy and avaricious  this man played the good priest when he first came  now he does like the rest  he must have a carriage and a posting chaise  he must have luxuries  like the bishops of the olden days  oh  all this priesthood  things will not go well  m  le comte until the emperor has freed us from these black capped rascals  down with the pope  matters were getting embroiled with rome  for my part i am for caesar alone  etc  etc on the other hand  this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire  good  said she to mademoiselle baptistine  monseigneur began with other people  but he has had to wind up with himself  after all  he has regulated all his charities  now here are three thousand francs for us  at last that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms expenses of carriage and circuit   for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital   livres   for the maternity charitable society of aix               for the maternity charitable society of draguignan            for foundlings                              for orphans                                                                                                 total                            such was m  myriel s budget as for the chance episcopal perquisites  the fees for marriage bans dispensations  private baptisms  sermons  benedictions  of churches or chapels  marriages  etc  the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity  since he bestowed them on the needy after a time  offerings of money flowed in  those who had and those who lacked knocked at m  myriel s door the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit  in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress  considerable sums of money passed through his hands  but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life  or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities far from it  as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above  all was given away  so to speak  before it was received  it was like water on dry soil  no matter how much money he received  he never had any  then he stripped himself the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letters  the poor people of the country side had selected  with a sort of affectionate instinct  among the names and prenomens of their bishop  that which had a meaning for them  and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome  we will follow their example  and will also call him thus when we have occasion to name him  moreover  this appellation pleased him i like that name  said he  bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur we do not claim that the portrait herewith presented is probable  we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original chapter iii a hard bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms  the diocese of d  is a fatiguing one  there are very few plains and a great many mountains  hardly any roads  as we have just seen  thirty two curacies  forty one vicarships  and two hundred and eighty five auxiliary chapels  to visit all these is quite a task the bishop managed to do it  he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood  in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain  and on a donkey in the mountains  the two old women accompanied him  when the trip was too hard for them  he went alone one day he arrived at senez  which is an ancient episcopal city  he was mounted on an ass  his purse  which was very dry at that moment  did not permit him any other equipage  the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town  and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes  some of the citizens were laughing around him monsieur the mayor  said the bishop  and messieurs citizens  i perceive that i shock you  you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ  i have done so from necessity  i assure you  and not from vanity in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent  and talked rather than preached  he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples  he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district  in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor  he said  look at the people of briancon  they have conferred on the poor  on widows and orphans  the right to have their meadows mown three days in advance of every one else  they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined  therefore it is a country which is blessed by god  for a whole century  there has not been a single murderer among them in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest  he said  look at the people of embrun  if  at the harvest season  the father of a family has his son away on service in the army  and his daughters at service in the town  and if he is ill and incapacitated  the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation  and on sunday  after the mass  all the inhabitants of the village men  women  and children go to the poor man s field and do his harvesting for him  and carry his straw and his grain to his granary  to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said  look at the mountaineers of devolny  a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years well  when the father of a family dies  the boys go off to seek their fortunes  leaving the property to the girls  so that they may find husbands  to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits  and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper  he said  look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras  there are three thousand souls of them  mon dieu  it is like a little republic  neither judge nor bailiff is known there  the mayor does everything  he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously  judges quarrels for nothing  divides inheritances without charge  pronounces sentences gratuitously  and he is obeyed  because he is a just man among simple men  to villages where he found no schoolmaster  he quoted once more the people of queyras  do you know how they manage  he said  since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths cannot always support a teacher  they have school masters who are paid by the whole valley  who make the round of the villages  spending a week in this one  ten days in that  and instruct them  these teachers go to the fairs  i have seen them there they are to be recognized by the quill pens which they wear in the cord of their hat  those who teach reading only have one pen  those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens  those who teach reading  reckoning and latin have three pens  but what a disgrace to be ignorant  do like the people of queyras thus he discoursed gravely and paternally  in default of examples  he invented parables  going directly to the point  with few phrases and many images  which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ  and being convinced himself  he was persuasive chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and affable  he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him  when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy  madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur  one day he rose from his arm chair  and went to his library in search of a book  this book was on one of the upper shelves  as the bishop was rather short of stature  he could not reach it  madame magloire  said he  fetch me a chair  my greatness grandeur  does not reach as far as that shelf one of his distant relatives  madame la comtesse de lo  rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating  in his presence  what she designated as the expectations  of her three sons  she had numerous relatives  who were very old and near to death  and of whom her sons were the natural heirs  the youngest of the three was to receive from a grand aunt a good hundred thousand livres of income  the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke  his uncle  the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather  the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts  on one occasion  however  he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de lo was relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations  she interrupted herself impatiently  mon dieu  cousin  what are you thinking about  i am thinking  replied the bishop  of a singular remark  which is to be found  i believe  in st  augustine place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit at another time  on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the country side  wherein not only the dignities of the dead man  but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives  spread over an entire page  what a stout back death has he exclaimed  what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him  and how much wit must men have  in order thus to press the tomb into the service of vanity he was gifted  on occasion  with a gentle raillery  which almost always concealed a serious meaning  in the course of one lent  a youthful vicar came to d  and preached in the cathedral  he was tolerably eloquent the subject of his sermon was charity  he urged the rich to give to the poor  in order to avoid hell  which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable  and to win paradise  which he represented as charming and desirable  among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant  who was somewhat of a usurer  named m geborand  who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloth  serges  and woollen galloons  never in his whole life had m geborand bestowed alms on any poor wretch  after the delivery of that sermon  it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral  there were six of them to share it  one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity  and said to his sister  with a smile  there is m geborand purchasing paradise for a sou when it was a question of charity  he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal  and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection  once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town  there was present the marquis de champtercier  a wealthy and avaricious old man  who contrived to be  at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultra voltairian  this variety of man has actually existed  when the bishop came to him  he touched his arm  you must give me something  m  le marquis  the marquis turned round and answered dryly  i have poor people of my own  monseigneur  give them to me  replied the bishop one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral my very dear brethren  my good friends  there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants  dwellings in france which have but three openings  eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand hovels which have but two openings  the door and one window  and three hundred and forty six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening  the door  and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows  just put poor families  old women and little children  in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result  alas  god gives air to men  the law sells it to them  i do not blame the law  but i bless god in the department of the isere  in the var  in the two departments of the alpes  the hautes  and the basses  the peasants have not even wheelbarrows  they transport their manure on the backs of men  they have no candles  and they burn resinous sticks  and bits of rope dipped in pitch  that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine  they make bread for six months at one time  they bake it with dried cow dung  in the winter they break this bread up with an axe  and they soak it for twenty four hours  in order to render it eatable  my brethren  have pity  behold the suffering on all sides of you born a provencal  he easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south  he said  en be  moussu  ses sage  as in lower languedoc  onte anaras passa  as in the basses alpes  puerte un bouen moutu embe un bouen fromage grase  as in upper dauphine  this pleased the people extremely  and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits  he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains  he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms  as he spoke all tongues  he entered into all hearts moreover  he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes  he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account  he said  examine the road over which the fault has passed being  as he described himself with a smile  an ex sinner  he had none of the asperities of austerity  and he professed  with a good deal of distinctness  and without the frown of the ferociously virtuous  a doctrine which may be summed up as follows man has upon him his flesh  which is at once his burden and his temptation  he drags it with him and yields to it  he must watch it check it  repress it  and obey it only at the last extremity  there may be some fault even in this obedience  but the fault thus committed is venial  it is a fall  but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer to be a saint is the exception  to be an upright man is the rule  err fall  sin if you will  but be upright the least possible sin is the law of man  no sin at all is the dream of the angel  all which is terrestrial is subject to sin  sin is a gravitation when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly  and growing angry very quickly  oh  oh  he said  with a smile  to all appearance  this is a great crime which all the world commits  these are hypocrisies which have taken fright  and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter he was indulgent towards women and poor people  on whom the burden of human society rest  he said  the faults of women  of children  of the feeble  the indigent  and the ignorant  are the fault of the husbands the fathers  the masters  the strong  the rich  and the wise he said  moreover  teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible  society is culpable  in that it does not afford instruction gratis  it is responsible for the night which it produces  this soul is full of shadow  sin is therein committed  the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin  but the person who has created the shadow it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things  i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel one day he heard a criminal case  which was in preparation and on the point of trial  discussed in a drawing room  a wretched man  being at the end of his resources  had coined counterfeit money  out of love for a woman  and for the child which he had had by her  counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch  the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man  she was held  but there were no proofs except against her  she alone could accuse her lover  and destroy him by her confession  she denied  they insisted  she persisted in her denial  thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown  he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover  and succeeded  by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented  in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival  and that the man was deceiving her  thereupon  exasperated by jealousy  she denounced her lover  confessed all  proved all the man was ruined  he was shortly to be tried at aix with his accomplice  they were relating the matter  and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate  by bringing jealousy into play  he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath  he had educed the justice of revenge  the bishop listened to all this in silence  when they had finished  he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried at the court of assizes he went on  and where will the advocate of the crown be tried a tragic event occurred at d  a man was condemned to death for murder  he was a wretched fellow  not exactly educated  not exactly ignorant  who had been a mountebank at fairs  and a writer for the public  the town took a great interest in the trial  on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man  the chaplain of the prison fell ill  a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments  they sent for the cure  it seems that he refused to come saying  that is no affair of mine  i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task  and with that mountebank  i  too  am ill  and besides it is not my place  this reply was reported to the bishop  who said monsieur le cure is right  it is not his place  it is mine he went instantly to the prison  descended to the cell of the mountebank  called him by name  took him by the hand  and spoke to him  he passed the entire day with him  forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man  and praying the condemned man for his own  he told him the best truths  which are also the most simple  he was father  brother  friend  he was bishop only to bless  he taught him everything  encouraged and consoled him  the man was on the point of dying in despair  death was an abyss to him  as he stood trembling on its mournful brink  he recoiled with horror  he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent  his condemnation  which had been a profound shock  had  in a manner  broken through  here and there  that wall which separates us from the mystery of things  and which we call life  he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches  and beheld only darkness  the bishop made him see light on the following day  when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch  the bishop was still there  he followed him  and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck  side by side with the criminal bound with cords he mounted the tumbril with him  he mounted the scaffold with him  the sufferer  who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day  was radiant  he felt that his soul was reconciled  and he hoped in god  the bishop embraced him  and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him  god raises from the dead him whom man slays  he whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more  pray  believe enter into life  the father is there  when he descended from the scaffold  there was something in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass  they did not know which was most worthy of admiration  his pallor or his serenity  on his return to the humble dwelling  which he designated  with a smile  as his palace  he said to his sister  i have just officiated pontifically since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood  there were people in the town who said  when commenting on this conduct of the bishop  it is affectation this  however  was a remark which was confined to the drawing rooms the populace  which perceives no jest in holy deeds  was touched  and admired him as for the bishop  it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it in fact  when the scaffold is there  all erected and prepared  it has something about it which produces hallucination  one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty  one may refrain from pronouncing upon it  from saying yes or no  so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one s own eyes  but if one encounters one of them  the shock is violent one is forced to decide  and to take part for or against  some admire it  like de maistre  others execrate it  like beccaria  the guillotine is the concretion of the law  it is called vindicte  it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral  he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers  all social problems erect their interrogation point around this chopping knife  the scaffold is a vision  the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry  the scaffold is not a machine  the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood  iron and cords it seems as though it were a being  possessed of i know not what sombre initiative  one would say that this piece of carpenter s work saw  that this machine heard  that this mechanism understood  that this wood this iron  and these cords were possessed of will  in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise  and as though taking part in what is going on  the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner  it devours  it eats flesh  it drinks blood  the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter  a spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted therefore  the impression was terrible and profound  on the day following the execution  and on many succeeding days  the bishop appeared to be crushed  the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared  the phantom of social justice tormented him  he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself  at times he talked to himself  and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice  this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved  i did not think that it was so monstrous  it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law  death belongs to god alone  by what right do men touch that unknown thing in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished nevertheless  it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution m  myriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying  he did not ignore the fact that therein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor  widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him  he came of his own accord  he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love  of the mother who had lost her child  as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech  oh  admirable consoler  he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness  but to magnify and dignify it by hope  he said have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead  think not of that which perishes  gaze steadily  you will perceive the living light of your well beloved dead in the depths of heaven  he knew that faith is wholesome  he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man  by pointing out to him the resigned man  and to transform the grief which gazes upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star chapter v monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long the private life of m  myriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life  the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of d  lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for any one who could have viewed it close at hand like all old men  and like the majority of thinkers  he slept little this brief slumber was profound  in the morning he meditated for an hour  then he said his mass  either at the cathedral or in his own house  his mass said  he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows  then he set to work a bishop is a very busy man  he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric  who is generally a canon  and nearly every day his vicars general  he has congregations to reprove  privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine prayer books  diocesan catechisms  books of hours  etc charges to write  sermons to authorize  cures and mayors to reconcile  a clerical correspondence  an administrative correspondence  on one side the state  on the other the holy see  and a thousand matters of business what time was left to him  after these thousand details of business  and his offices and his breviary  he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick  and the afflicted  the time which was left to him from the afflicted  the sick  and the necessitous  he devoted to work  sometimes he dug in his garden  again  he read or wrote  he had but one word for both these kinds of toil  he called them gardening  the mind is a garden  said he towards mid day  when the weather was fine  he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town  often entering lowly dwellings  he was seen walking alone  buried in his own thoughts  his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long cane  clad in his wadded purple garment of silk  which was very warm  wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes  and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared  one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it  the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun  he bestowed his blessing  and they blessed him  they pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything illustration  the comfortor  b comfortor here and there he halted  accosted the little boys and girls  and smiled upon the mothers  he visited the poor so long as he had any money  when he no longer had any  he visited the rich as he made his cassocks last a long while  and did not wish to have it noticed  he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer on his return  he dined  the dinner resembled his breakfast at half past eight in the evening he supped with his sister  madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table  nothing could be more frugal than this repast  if  however  the bishop had one of his cures to supper  madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake  or with some fine game from the mountains  every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal  the bishop did not interfere  with that exception  his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water  and oil soup  thus it was said in the town  when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure  he indulges in the cheer of a trappist after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire  then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets  and again on the margin of some folio  he was a man of letters and rather learned  he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts  among others  a dissertation on this verse in genesis  in the beginning  the spirit of god floated upon the waters with this verse he compares three texts  the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew  flavius josephus who says  a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth  and finally  the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos  which renders it  a wind coming from god blew upon the face of the waters  in another dissertation  he examines the theological works of hugo  bishop of ptolemais  great grand uncle to the writer of this book  and establishes the fact  that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century  under the pseudonym of barleycourt sometimes  in the midst of his reading  no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand  he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation  whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself  these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them  we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton  cornwallis  and the admirals on the american station  versailles  poincot  book seller  and paris  pissot bookseller  quai des augustins here is the note oh  you who are ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful  the maccabees call you the creator  the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty  baruch calls you immensity  the psalms call you wisdom and truth  john calls you light  the books of kings call you lord  exodus calls you providence leviticus  sanctity  esdras  justice  the creation calls you god  man calls you father  but solomon calls you compassion  and that is the most beautiful of all your names toward nine o clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to their chambers on the first floor  leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor it is necessary that we should  in this place  give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d chapter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived consisted  as we have said  of a ground floor  and one story above  three rooms on the ground floor  three chambers on the first  and an attic above  behind the house was a garden  a quarter of an acre in extent  the two women occupied the first floor  the bishop was lodged below  the first room  opening on the street  served him as dining room  the second was his bedroom  and the third his oratory  there was no exit possible from this oratory  except by passing through the bedroom  nor from the bedroom  without passing through the dining room  at the end of the suite  in the oratory  there was a detached alcove with a bed  for use in cases of hospitality the bishop offered this bed to country curates whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought to d the pharmacy of the hospital  a small building which had been added to the house  and abutted on the garden  had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar  in addition to this  there was in the garden a stable  which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital  and in which the bishop kept two cows  no matter what the quantity of milk they gave  he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital  i am paying my tithes  he said his bedroom was tolerably large  and rather difficult to warm in bad weather  as wood is extremely dear at d  he hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cow shed  here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold  he called it his winter salon in this winter salon  as in the dining room  there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood  and four straw seated chairs  in addition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard  painted pink  in water colors  out of a similar sideboard  properly draped with white napery and imitation lace  the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of d  had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for monseigneur s oratory  on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor  the most beautiful of altars  he said  is the soul of an unhappy creature consoled and thanking god in his oratory there were two straw prie dieu  and there was an arm chair  also in straw  in his bedroom  when  by chance  he received seven or eight persons at one time  the prefect  or the general  or the staff of the regiment in garrison  or several pupils from the little seminary  the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable  the prie dieu from the oratory  and the arm chair from the bedroom  in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors  a room was dismantled for each new guest it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party  the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter  or by strolling in the garden if it was summer there was still another chair in the detached alcove  but the straw was half gone from it  and it had but three legs  so that it was of service only when propped against the wall  mademoiselle baptistine had also in her own room a very large easy chair of wood  which had formerly been gilded  and which was covered with flowered pekin  but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow  it could not  therefore  be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture mademoiselle baptistine s ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet  stamped with a rose pattern  and with mahogany in swan s neck style  with a sofa  but this would have cost five hundred francs at least  and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years  she had ended by renouncing the idea  however  who is there who has attained his ideal nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop s bedchamber  a glazed door opened on the garden  opposite this was the bed a hospital bed of iron  with a canopy of green serge  in the shadow of the bed  behind a curtain  were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world  there were two doors  one near the chimney  opening into the oratory  the other near the bookcase  opening into the dining room  the bookcase was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books  the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble  and habitually without fire  in the chimney stood a pair of firedogs of iron  ornamented above with two garlanded vases  and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf  which was a sort of episcopal luxury  above the chimney piece hung a crucifix of copper  with the silver worn off  fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen  near the glass door a large table with an inkstand loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes  before the table an arm chair of straw  in front of the bed a prie dieu  borrowed from the oratory two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed  small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chaliot  bishop of saint claude  the other  the abbe tourteau  vicar general of agde  abbe of grand champ  order of citeaux diocese of chartres  when the bishop succeeded to this apartment  after the hospital patients  he had found these portraits there  and had left them  they were priests  and probably donors two reasons for respecting them  all that he knew about these two persons was  that they had been appointed by the king  the one to his bishopric  the other to his benefice  on the same day  the th of april   madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust  the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper  yellowed by time  and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of grand champ with four wafers at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff  which finally became so old  that  in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it  this seam took the form of a cross  the bishop often called attention to it  how delightful that is  he said all the rooms in the house  without exception  those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor  were white washed  which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals however  in their latter years  madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over  paintings  ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptistine  as we shall see further on  before becoming a hospital  this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois  hence this decoration  the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week  with straw mats in front of all the beds altogether  this dwelling  which was attended to by the two women  was exquisitely clean from top to bottom  this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted  he said  that takes nothing from the poor it must be confessed  however  that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forks and a soup ladle  which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight  as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth  and since we are now painting the bishop of d  as he was in reality  we must add that he had said more than once  i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver  which he had inherited from a great aunt  these candlesticks held two wax candles  and usually figured on the bishop s chimney piece when he had any one to dinner  madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table in the bishop s own chamber  at the head of his bed  there was a small cupboard  in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forks and the big spoon every night  but it is necessary to add  that the key was never removed the garden  which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned  was composed of four alleys in cross form  radiating from a tank  another walk made the circuit of the garden  and skirted the white wall which enclosed it  these alleys left behind them four square plots rimmed with box  in three of these  madame magloire cultivated vegetables  in the fourth  the bishop had planted some flowers  here and there stood a few fruit trees  madame magloire had once remarked  with a sort of gentle malice  monseigneur  you who turn everything to account  have  nevertheless  one useless plot  it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets  madame magloire  retorted the bishop  you are mistaken  the beautiful is as useful as the useful  he added after a pause  more so  perhaps this plot  consisting of three or four beds  occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books  he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming  hoeing  and making holes here and there in the earth  into which he dropped seeds  he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him  moreover  he made no pretensions to botany  he ignored groups and consistency  he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method  he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons  nor with jussieu against linnaeus  he did not study plants  he loved flowers  he respected learned men greatly  he respected the ignorant still more  and  without ever failing in these two respects  he watered his flower beds every summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green the house had not a single door which could be locked  the door of the dining room  which  as we have said  opened directly on the cathedral square  had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison  the bishop had had all this ironwork removed  and this door was never fastened  either by night or by day  with anything except the latch  all that the first passerby had to do at any hour  was to give it a push  at first  the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened  but monsieur de d  had said to them  have bolts put on your rooms  if that will please you  they had ended by sharing his confidence  or by at least acting as though they shared it madame magloire alone had frights from time to time  as for the bishop his thought can be found explained  or at least indicated  in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible  this is the shade of difference  the door of the physician should never be shut  the door of the priest should always be open on another book  entitled philosophy of the medical science  he had written this other note  am not i a physician like them  i also have my patients  and then  too  i have some whom i call my unfortunates again he wrote  do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you  the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter it chanced that a worthy cure  i know not whether it was the cure of couloubroux or the cure of pompierry  took it into his head to ask him one day  probably at the instigation of madame magloire  whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion  to a certain extent  in leaving his door unfastened day and night  at the mercy of any one who should choose to enter  and whether  in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded  the bishop touched his shoulder  with gentle gravity  and said to him  nisi dominus custodierit domum  in vanum vigilant qui custodiunt eam  unless the lord guard the house  in vain do they watch who guard it then he spoke of something else he was fond of saying  there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons only  he added  ours must be tranquil chapter vii cravatte it is here that a fact falls naturally into place  which we must not omit  because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of a man the bishop of d  was after the destruction of the band of gaspard bes  who had infested the gorges of ollioules  one of his lieutenants  cravatte  took refuge in the mountains  he concealed himself for some time with his bandits  the remnant of gaspard bes s troop  in the county of nice  then he made his way to piedmont  and suddenly reappeared in france  in the vicinity of barcelonette  he was first seen at jauziers  then at tuiles  he hid himself in the caverns of the joug de l aigle  and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and ubayette he even pushed as far as embrun  entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy  his highway robberies laid waste the country side  the gendarmes were set on his track  but in vain  he always escaped  sometimes he resisted by main force  he was a bold wretch  in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived  he was making his circuit to chastelar  the mayor came to meet him  and urged him to retrace his steps  cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche  and beyond  there was danger even with an escort  it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose therefore  said the bishop  i intend to go without escort you do not really mean that  monseigneur  exclaimed the mayor i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes  and shall set out in an hour set out set out alone alone monseigneur  you will not do that there exists yonder in the mountains  said the bishop  a tiny community no bigger than that  which i have not seen for three years they are my good friends  those gentle and honest shepherds  they own one goat out of every thirty that they tend  they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors  and they play the mountain airs on little flutes with six holes  they need to be told of the good god now and then  what would they say to a bishop who was afraid  what would they say if i did not go but the brigands  monseigneur hold  said the bishop  i must think of that  you are right  i may meet them  they  too  need to be told of the good god but  monseigneur  there is a band of them  a flock of wolves monsieur le maire  it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd  who knows the ways of providence they will rob you  monseigneur i have nothing they will kill you an old goodman of a priest  who passes along mumbling his prayers  bah to what purpose oh  mon dieu  what if you should meet them i should beg alms of them for my poor do not go  monseigneur  in the name of heaven  you are risking your life monsieur le maire  said the bishop  is that really all  i am not in the world to guard my own life  but to guard souls they had to allow him to do as he pleased  he set out  accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide  his obstinacy was bruited about the country side  and caused great consternation he would take neither his sister nor madame magloire  he traversed the mountain on mule back  encountered no one  and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends  the shepherds  he remained there for a fortnight  preaching  administering the sacrament  teaching exhorting  when the time of his departure approached  he resolved to chant a te deum pontifically  he mentioned it to the cure  but what was to be done  there were no episcopal ornaments  they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy  with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace bah  said the bishop  let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless  monsieur le cure  things will arrange themselves they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood  all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly while they were thus embarrassed  a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop  by two unknown horsemen  who departed on the instant  the chest was opened  it contained a cope of cloth of gold  a mitre ornamented with diamonds  an archbishop s cross a magnificent crosier all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame d embrun  in the chest was a paper  on which these words were written  from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu did not i say that things would come right of themselves  said the bishop  then he added  with a smile  to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate  god sends the cope of an archbishop monseigneur  murmured the cure  throwing back his head with a smile god or the devil the bishop looked steadily at the cure  and repeated with authority god when he returned to chastelar  the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity  all along the road  at the priest s house in chastelar he rejoined mademoiselle baptistine and madame magloire  who were waiting for him  and he said to his sister  well  was i in the right  the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands  and he returns from them with his hands full  i set out bearing only my faith in god  i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral that evening  before he went to bed  he said again  let us never fear robbers nor murderers  those are dangers from without  petty dangers let us fear ourselves  prejudices are the real robbers  vices are the real murderers  the great dangers lie within ourselves  what matters it what threatens our head or our purse  let us think only of that which threatens our soul then  turning to his sister  sister  never a precaution on the part of the priest  against his fellow man  that which his fellow does  god permits  let us confine ourselves to prayer  when we think that a danger is approaching us  let us pray  not for ourselves  but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account however  such incidents were rare in his life  we relate those of which we know  but generally he passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment  one month of his year resembled one hour of his day as to what became of the treasure  of the cathedral of embrun  we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction  it consisted of very handsome things  very tempting things  and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate  stolen they had already been elsewhere  half of the adventure was completed  it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft  and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor  however  we make no assertions on this point  only  a rather obscure note was found among the bishop s papers  which may bear some relation to this matter  and which is couched in these terms  the question is  to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital chapter viii philosophy after drinking the senator above mentioned was a clever man  who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles  and which are called conscience  sworn faith  justice  duty  he had marched straight to his goal  without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest  he was an old attorney  softened by success  not a bad man by any means  who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his sons in law  his relations  and even to his friends  having wisely seized upon  in life  good sides  good opportunities  good windfalls everything else seemed to him very stupid  he was intelligent  and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus  while he was  in reality  only a product of pigault lebrun  he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things  and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop  he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m  myriel himself  who listened to him on some semi official occasion or other  i do not recollect what count  this senator  and m  myriel were to dine with the prefect at dessert  the senator  who was slightly exhilarated  though still perfectly dignified  exclaimed egad  bishop  let s have a discussion  it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking  we are two augurs  i am going to make a confession to you  i have a philosophy of my own and you are right  replied the bishop  as one makes one s philosophy so one lies on it  you are on the bed of purple  senator the senator was encouraged  and went on let us be good fellows good devils even  said the bishop i declare to you  continued the senator  that the marquis d argens pyrrhon  hobbes  and m  naigeon are no rascals  i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges like yourself  count  interposed the bishop the senator resumed i hate diderot  he is an ideologist  a declaimer  and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom  and more bigoted than voltaire  voltaire made sport of needham  and he was wrong  for needham s eels prove that god is useless  a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux  suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world  man is the eel  then what is the good of the eternal father  the jehovah hypothesis tires me  bishop  it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people  whose reasoning is hollow  down with that great all  which torments me  hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace between you and me  and in order to empty my sack  and make confession to my pastor  as it behooves me to do  i will admit to you that i have good sense  i am not enthusiastic over your jesus  who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity  tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars  renunciation  why  sacrifice  to what end i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf  let us stick to nature  then  we are at the top  let us have a superior philosophy  what is the advantage of being at the top  if one sees no further than the end of other people s noses  let us live merrily  life is all  that man has another future elsewhere  on high below  anywhere  i don t believe  not one single word of it  ah sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me  i must take heed to everything i do  i must cudgel my brains over good and evil  over the just and the unjust  over the fas and the nefas  why  because i shall have to render an account of my actions  when  after death  what a fine dream  after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me have a handful of dust seized by a shadow hand  if you can  let us tell the truth  we who are initiated  and who have raised the veil of isis there is no such thing as either good or evil  there is vegetation let us seek the real  let us get to the bottom of it  let us go into it thoroughly  what the deuce  let us go to the bottom of it  we must scent out the truth  dig in the earth for it  and seize it  then it gives you exquisite joys  then you grow strong  and you laugh  i am square on the bottom  i am  immortality  bishop  is a chance  a waiting for dead men s shoes  ah  what a charming promise  trust to it  if you like  what a fine lot adam has  we are souls  and we shall be angels  with blue wings on our shoulder blades  do come to my assistance  is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star  very well  we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars  and then  besides  we shall see god  ta  ta  ta  what twaddle all these paradises are  god is a nonsensical monster  i would not say that in the moniteur  egad  but i may whisper it among friends  inter pocula  to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow  be the dupe of the infinite  i m not such a fool  i am a nought  i call myself monsieur le comte nought  senator  did i exist before my birth  no  shall i exist after death  no  what am i  a little dust collected in an organism  what am i to do on this earth  the choice rests with me  suffer or enjoy whither will suffering lead me  to nothingness  but i shall have suffered  whither will enjoyment lead me  to nothingness  but i shall have enjoyed myself  my choice is made  one must eat or be eaten  i shall eat  it is better to be the tooth than the grass  such is my wisdom  after which  go whither i push thee  the grave digger is there the pantheon for some of us  all falls into the great hole  end  finis total liquidation  this is the vanishing point  death is death  believe me  i laugh at the idea of there being any one who has anything to tell me on that subject  fables of nurses  bugaboo for children  jehovah for men  no  our to morrow is the night  beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness  you have been sardanapalus  you have been vincent de paul it makes no difference  that is the truth  then live your life above all things  make use of your i  while you have it  in truth bishop  i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own  and i have my philosophers  i don t let myself be taken in with that nonsense of course  there must be something for those who are down for the barefooted beggars  knife grinders  and miserable wretches  legends chimeras  the soul  immortality  paradise  the stars  are provided for them to swallow  they gobble it down  they spread it on their dry bread he who has nothing else has the good  god  that is the least he can have  i oppose no objection to that  but i reserve monsieur naigeon for myself  the good god is good for the populace the bishop clapped his hands that s talking  he exclaimed  what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism  not every one who wants it can have it  ah when one does have it  one is no longer a dupe  one does not stupidly allow one s self to be exiled like cato  nor stoned like stephen  nor burned alive like jeanne d arc  those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible  and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness places  sinecures  dignities  power  whether well or ill acquired  lucrative recantations  useful treacheries  savory capitulations of conscience and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished  how agreeable that is  i do not say that with reference to you  senator  nevertheless  it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you  you great lords have  so you say  a philosophy of your own  and for yourselves  which is exquisite  refined accessible to the rich alone  good for all sauces  and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably  this philosophy has been extracted from the depths  and unearthed by special seekers  but you are good natured princes  and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people  very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffled turkey of the poor chapter ix the brother as depicted by the sister in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of d  and of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions  their thoughts  their feminine instincts even  which are easily alarmed  to the habits and purposes of the bishop  without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them  we cannot do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptistine to madame the vicomtess de boischevron  the friend of her childhood  this letter is in our possession                                         d  dec   my good madam  not a day passes without our speaking of you  it is our established custom  but there is another reason besides  just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls  madam magloire has made some discoveries  now our two chambers hung with antique paper whitewashed over  would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours madam magloire has pulled off all the paper  there were things beneath my drawing room  which contains no furniture  and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing  is fifteen feet in height eighteen square  with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams  as in yours  this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital  and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers but my room is the one you ought to see  madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top  some paintings which without being good are very tolerable  the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens  the name of which escapes me  in short  where the roman ladies repaired on one single night  what shall i say to you  i have romans  and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word  and the whole train  madam magloire has cleaned it all off  this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired  and the whole revarnished  and my chamber will be a regular museum  she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier tables of ancient fashion  they asked us two crowns of six francs each to regild them  but it is much better to give the money to the poor  and they are very ugly besides  and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany i am always very happy  my brother is so good  he gives all he has to the poor and sick  we are very much cramped  the country is trying in the winter  and we really must do something for those who are in need we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed  you see that these are great treats my brother has ways of his own  when he talks  he says that a bishop ought to be so  just imagine  the door of our house is never fastened whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother s room  he fears nothing  even at night  that is his sort of bravery  he says he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him  he exposes himself to all sorts of dangers  and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it  one must know how to understand him he goes out in the rain  he walks in the water  he travels in winter  he fears neither suspicious roads nor dangerous encounters  nor night last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers  he would not take us  he was absent for a fortnight  on his return nothing had happened to him  he was thought to be dead  but was perfectly well  and said  this is the way i have been robbed  and then he opened a trunk full of jewels  all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun  which the thieves had given him when he returned on that occasion  i could not refrain from scolding him a little  taking care  however  not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise  so that no one might hear me at first i used to say to myself  there are no dangers which will stop him  he is terrible  now i have ended by getting used to it  i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him  he risks himself as he sees fit  i carry off madam magloire  i enter my chamber  i pray for him and fall asleep  i am at ease  because i know that if anything were to happen to him  it would be the end of me  i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop  it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences  but now the habit has been acquired  we pray together  we tremble together  and we fall asleep  if the devil were to enter this house  he would be allowed to do so  after all  what is there for us to fear in this house  there is always some one with us who is stronger than we  the devil may pass through it  but the good god dwells here this suffices me  my brother has no longer any need of saying a word to me  i understand him without his speaking  and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence  that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family  you are aware that he knows everything  and that he has memories  because he is still a very good royalist  they really are a very ancient norman family of the generalship of caen  five hundred years ago there was a raoul de faux  a jean de faux  and a thomas de faux  who were gentlemen  and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort  the last was guy etienne alexandre  and was commander of a regiment  and something in the light horse of bretagne his daughter  marie louise  married adrien charles de gramont  son of the duke louis de gramont  peer of france  colonel of the french guards and lieutenant general of the army  it is written faux  fauq  and faoucq good madame  recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal  as for your dear sylvanie  she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me she is well  works as you would wish  and loves me that is all that i desire  the souvenir which she sent through you reached me safely  and it makes me very happy  my health is not so very bad  and yet i grow thinner every day  farewell  my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you  a thousand good wishes baptistine p s  your grand nephew is charming  do you know that he will soon be five years old  yesterday he saw some one riding by on horseback who had on knee caps  and he said  what has he got on his knees  he is a charming child  his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room  like a carriage  and saying  hu as will be perceived from this letter  these two women understood how to mould themselves to the bishop s ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself  the bishop of d  in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him  sometimes did things that were grand  bold  and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact  they trembled  but they let him alone  sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance  but never at the time  nor afterwards  they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign  in any action once entered upon at certain moments  without his having occasion to mention it  when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability  so perfect was his simplicity  they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop  then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house  they served him passively  and if obedience consisted in disappearing  they disappeared they understood  with an admirable delicacy of instinct  that certain cares may be put under constraint  thus  even when believing him to be in peril  they understood  i will not say his thought  but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him  they confided him to god moreover  baptistine said  as we have just read  that her brother s end would prove her own  madame magloire did not say this  but she knew it chapter x the bishop in the presence of an unknown light at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding pages  he did a thing which  if the whole town was to be believed  was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits in the country near d  a man lived quite alone  this man  we will state at once  was a former member of the convention  his name was g member of the convention  g  was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of d  a member of the convention can you imagine such a thing  that existed from the time when people called each other thou  and when they said citizen  this man was almost a monster he had not voted for the death of the king  but almost  he was a quasi regicide  he had been a terrible man  how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost s court  on the return of the legitimate princes  they need not have cut off his head  if you please  clemency must be exercised  agreed  but a good banishment for life  an example  in short  etc  besides  he was an atheist  like all the rest of those people  gossip of the geese about the vulture was g  a vulture after all  yes  if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his  as he had not voted for the death of the king  he had not been included in the decrees of exile  and had been able to remain in france he dwelt at a distance of three quarters of an hour from the city  far from any hamlet  far from any road  in some hidden turn of a very wild valley  no one knew exactly where  he had there  it was said  a sort of field  a hole  a lair  there were no neighbors  not even passers by since he had dwelt in that valley  the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass  the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman nevertheless  the bishop meditated on the subject  and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention  and he said  there is a soul yonder which is lonely and he added  deep in his own mind  i owe him a visit but  let us avow it  this idea  which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a moment s reflection  as strange  impossible  and almost repulsive  for  at bottom  he shared the general impression  and the old member of the convention inspired him  without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself  with that sentiment which borders on hate  and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement still  should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil  no but what a sheep the good bishop was perplexed  sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned finally  the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd  who served the member of the convention in his hovel  had come in quest of a doctor  that the old wretch was dying  that paralysis was gaining on him  and that he would not live over night thank god some added the bishop took his staff  put on his cloak  on account of his too threadbare cassock  as we have mentioned  and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon  and set out the sun was setting  and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot  with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair  he strode over a ditch  leaped a hedge  made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock  took a few steps with a good deal of boldness  and suddenly  at the extremity of the waste land  and behind lofty brambles  he caught sight of the cavern it was a very low hut  poor  small  and clean  with a vine nailed against the outside near the door  in an old wheel chair  the arm chair of the peasants there was a white haired man  smiling at the sun near the seated man stood a young boy  the shepherd lad  he was offering the old man a jar of milk while the bishop was watching him  the old man spoke  thank you  he said  i need nothing  and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child the bishop stepped forward  at the sound which he made in walking  the old man turned his head  and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life this is the first time since i have been here  said he  that any one has entered here  who are you  sir the bishop answered my name is bienvenu myriel bienvenu myriel  i have heard that name  are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome i am the old man resumed with a half smile in that case  you are my bishop something of that sort enter  sir the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop  but the bishop did not take it  the bishop confined himself to the remark i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed  you certainly do not seem to me to be ill monsieur  replied the old man  i am going to recover he paused  and then said i shall die three hours hence then he continued i am something of a doctor  i know in what fashion the last hour draws on  yesterday  only my feet were cold  to day  the chill has ascended to my knees  now i feel it mounting to my waist  when it reaches the heart i shall stop  the sun is beautiful  is it not  i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things  you can talk to me  it does not fatigue me  you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death  it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment  one has one s caprices  i should have liked to last until the dawn  but i know that i shall hardly live three hours  it will be night then  what does it matter  after all  dying is a simple affair  one has no need of the light for that  so be it  i shall die by starlight the old man turned to the shepherd lad go to thy bed  thou wert awake all last night  thou art tired the child entered the hut the old man followed him with his eyes  and added  as though speaking to himself i shall die while he sleeps  the two slumbers may be good neighbors the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been  he did not think he discerned god in this manner of dying  let us say the whole  for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like the rest  he  who on occasion  was so fond of laughing at his grace  was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur  and he was almost tempted to retort citizen  he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity  common enough to doctors and priests  but which was not habitual with him  this man  after all  this member of the convention  this representative of the people  had been one of the powerful ones of the earth  for the first time in his life  probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe meanwhile  the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality  in which one could have distinguished  possibly  that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust the bishop  on his side  although he generally restrained his curiosity which  in his opinion  bordered on a fault  could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which  as it did not have its course in sympathy  would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach  in connection with any other man  a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law  even of the law of charity  g  calm  his body almost upright  his voice vibrating  was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist  the revolution had many of these men  proportioned to the epoch  in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof  though so near to his end  he preserved all the gestures of health  in his clear glance  in his firm tone  in the robust movement of his shoulders  there was something calculated to disconcert death  azrael  the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre  would have turned back  and thought that he had mistaken the door  g  seemed to be dying because he willed it so  there was freedom in his agony  his legs alone were motionless  it was there that the shadows held him fast  his feet were cold and dead  but his head survived with all the power of life  and seemed full of light  g at this solemn moment  resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below there was a stone there  the bishop sat down  the exordium was abrupt i congratulate you  said he  in the tone which one uses for a reprimand  you did not vote for the death of the king  after all the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all  he replied  the smile had quite disappeared from his face do not congratulate me too much  sir  i did vote for the death of the tyrant it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity what do you mean to say  resumed the bishop i mean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance  i voted for the death of that tyrant  that tyrant engendered royalty  which is authority falsely understood  while science is authority rightly understood  man should be governed only by science and conscience  added the bishop it is the same thing  conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him the member of the convention resumed so far as louis xvi  was concerned  i said no  i did not think that i had the right to kill a man  but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil i voted the end of the tyrant  that is to say  the end of prostitution for woman  the end of slavery for man  the end of night for the child in voting for the republic  i voted for that  i voted for fraternity concord  the dawn  i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors  the crumbling away of prejudices and errors causes light  we have caused the fall of the old world  and the old world  that vase of miseries  has become  through its upsetting upon the human race  an urn of joy mixed joy  said the bishop you may say troubled joy  and to day  after that fatal return of the past  which is called  joy which has disappeared  alas  the work was incomplete  i admit  we demolished the ancient regime in deeds  we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas  to destroy abuses is not sufficient  customs must be modified  the mill is there no longer  the wind is still there you have demolished  it may be of use to demolish  but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath right has its wrath  bishop  and the wrath of right is an element of progress  in any case  and in spite of whatever may be said  the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ  incomplete  it may be  but sublime  it set free all the unknown social quantities  it softened spirits  it calmed  appeased enlightened  it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth  it was a good thing  the french revolution is the consecration of humanity the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes  the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity  and exclaimed  so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation ah  there you go   i was expecting that word  a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years  at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst  you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial the bishop felt  without  perhaps  confessing it  that something within him had suffered extinction  nevertheless  he put a good face on the matter  he replied the judge speaks in the name of justice  the priest speaks in the name of pity  which is nothing but a more lofty justice  a thunderbolt should commit no error  and he added  regarding the member of the convention steadily the while  louis xvii the conventionary stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop s arm louis xvii  let us see  for whom do you mourn  is it for the innocent child  very good  in that case i mourn with you  is it for the royal child  i demand time for reflection  to me  the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued  for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche  is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv  an innocent child  martyred in the tower of the temple  for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv monsieur  said the bishop  i like not this conjunction of names cartouche  louis xv  to which of the two do you object a momentary silence ensued  the bishop almost regretted having come  and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken the conventionary resumed ah  monsieur priest  you love not the crudities of the true  christ loved them  he seized a rod and cleared out the temple  his scourge full of lightnings  was a harsh speaker of truths  when he cried sinite parvulos  he made no distinction between the little children it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod  innocence  monsieur  is its own crown  innocence has no need to be a highness  it is as august in rags as in fleurs de lys that is true  said the bishop in a low voice i persist  continued the conventionary g  you have mentioned louis xvii  to me  let us come to an understanding  shall we weep for all the innocent  all martyrs  all children  the lowly as well as the exalted i agree to that  but in that case  as i have told you  we must go back further than  and our tears must begin before louis xvii  i will weep with you over the children of kings  provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people i weep for all  said the bishop equally  exclaimed conventionary g  and if the balance must incline  let it be on the side of the people  they have been suffering longer another silence ensued  the conventionary was the first to break it  he raised himself on one elbow  took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger  as one does mechanically when one interrogates and judges  and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony  it was almost an explosion yes  sir  the people have been suffering a long while  and hold  that is not all  either  why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii  i know you not  ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone  never setting foot outside  and seeing no one but that child who helps me  your name has reached me in a confused manner  it is true  and very badly pronounced  i must admit but that signifies nothing  clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman  the people  by the way  i did not hear the sound of your carriage  you have left it yonder  behind the coppice at the fork of the roads  no doubt  i do not know you  i tell you  you have told me that you are the bishop  but that affords me no information as to your moral personality  in short  i repeat my question  who are you  you are a bishop  that is to say  a prince of the church  one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues  who have vast prebends the bishopric of d  fifteen thousand francs settled income  ten thousand in perquisites  total  twenty five thousand francs who have kitchens who have liveries  who make good cheer  who eat moor hens on friday  who strut about  a lackey before  a lackey behind  in a gala coach  and who have palaces  and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot  you are a prelate revenues  palace  horses servants  good table  all the sensualities of life  you have this like the rest  and like the rest  you enjoy it  it is well  but this says either too much or too little  this does not enlighten me upon the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom to me  to whom do i speak  who are you the bishop hung his head and replied  vermis sum i am a worm a worm of the earth in a carriage  growled the conventionary it was the conventionary s turn to be arrogant  and the bishop s to be humble the bishop resumed mildly so be it  sir  but explain to me how my carriage  which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder  how my good table and the moor hens which i eat on friday  how my twenty five thousand francs income  how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty  and that  was not inexorable the conventionary passed his hand across his brow  as though to sweep away a cloud before replying to you  he said  i beseech you to pardon me  i have just committed a wrong  sir  you are at my house  you are my guest  i owe you courtesy  you discuss my ideas  and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments  your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate  but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them  i promise you to make no use of them in the future i thank you  said the bishop g  resumed let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me  where were we  what were you saying to me  that  was inexorable inexorable  yes  said the bishop  what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine what think you of bossuet chanting the te deum over the dragonnades the retort was a harsh one  but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel  the bishop quivered under it  no reply occurred to him  but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bossuet  the best of minds will have their fetiches  and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic the conventionary began to pant  the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice  still  there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes  he went on let me say a few words more in this and that direction  i am willing apart from the revolution  which  taken as a whole  is an immense human affirmation   is  alas  a rejoinder  you think it inexorable  sir but what of the whole monarchy  sir  carrier is a bandit  but what name do you give to montrevel  fouquier tainville is a rascal  but what is your opinion as to lamoignon baville  maillard is terrible  but saulx tavannes  if you please  duchene senior is ferocious  but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier  jourdan coupe tete is a monster  but not so great a one as m  the marquis de louvois  sir sir  i am sorry for marie antoinette  archduchess and queen  but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman  who  in  under louis the great  sir  while with a nursing infant  was bound  naked to the waist to a stake  and the child kept at a distance  her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish  the little one  hungry and pale  beheld that breast and cried and agonized  the executioner said to the woman  a mother and a nurse  abjure  giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience  what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to a mother  bear this well in mind sir  the french revolution had its reasons for existence  its wrath will be absolved by the future  its result is the world made better  from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race  i abridge  i stop  i have too much the advantage  moreover  i am dying and ceasing to gaze at the bishop  the conventionary concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words yes  the brutalities of progress are called revolutions  when they are over  this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly  but that it has progressed the conventionary doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop  one remained  however  and from this intrenchment  the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu s resistance came forth this reply  wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning progress should believe in god  good cannot have an impious servitor he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race the former representative of the people made no reply  he was seized with a fit of trembling  he looked towards heaven  and in his glance a tear gathered slowly  when the eyelid was full  the tear trickled down his livid cheek  and he said  almost in a stammer  quite low  and to himself  while his eyes were plunged in the depths o thou  o ideal  thou alone existest the bishop experienced an indescribable shock after a pause  the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is  he is there  if the infinite had no person  person would be without limit  it would not be infinite  in other words  it would not exist  there is  then  an i  that i  of the infinite is god the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice  and with the shiver of ecstasy  as though he beheld some one  when he had spoken his eyes closed  the effort had exhausted him  it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him  that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death the supreme moment was approaching the bishop understood this  time pressed  it was as a priest that he had come  from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes  he took that wrinkled  aged and ice cold hand in his  and bent over the dying man this hour is the hour of god  do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain the conventionary opened his eyes again  a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance bishop  said he  with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength  i have passed my life in meditation  study  and contemplation  i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs  i obeyed  abuses existed  i combated them  tyrannies existed i destroyed them  rights and principles existed  i proclaimed and confessed them  our territory was invaded  i defended it  france was menaced  i offered my breast  i was not rich  i am poor  i have been one of the masters of the state  the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver  i dined in dead tree street  at twenty two sous  i have succored the oppressed  i have comforted the suffering  i tore the cloth from the altar  it is true  but it was to bind up the wounds of my country  i have always upheld the march forward of the human race  forward towards the light  and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity  i have when the occasion offered  protected my own adversaries  men of your profession  and there is at peteghem  in flanders  at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace  a convent of urbanists  the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu  which i saved in  i have done my duty according to my powers  and all the good that i was able  after which  i was hunted down  pursued  persecuted blackened  jeered at  scorned  cursed  proscribed  for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me  to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned  and i accept this isolation of hatred  without hating any one myself  now i am eighty six years old  i am on the point of death  what is it that you have come to ask of me your blessing  said the bishop and he knelt down when the bishop raised his head again  the face of the conventionary had become august  he had just expired the bishop returned home  deeply absorbed in thoughts which cannot be known to us  he passed the whole night in prayer  on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention g  he contented himself with pointing heavenward from that moment he redoubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers any allusion to that old wretch of a g  caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation  no one could say that the passage of that soul before his  and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his  did not count for something in his approach to perfection this pastoral visit  naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop  there was evidently no conversion to be expected  all those revolutionists are backsliders  then why go there  what was there to be seen there  he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual  addressed this sally to him  monseigneur  people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red cap oh  oh that s a coarse color  replied the bishop  it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat chapter xi a restriction we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves  were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop  or a patriotic cure  his meeting  which may almost be designated as his union  with conventionary g  left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment  which rendered him still more gentle  that is all although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician  this is perhaps  the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch  supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude let us  then  go back a few years some time after the elevation of m  myriel to the episcopate  the emperor had made him a baron of the empire  in company with many other bishops  the arrest of the pope took place  as every one knows  on the night of the th to the th of july   on this occasion  m  myriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris  this synod was held at notre dame  and assembled for the first time on the th of june   under the presidency of cardinal fesch  m  myriel was one of the ninety five bishops who attended it  but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences  bishop of a mountain diocese  living so very close to nature  in rusticity and deprivation  it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages  ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly  he very soon returned to d  he was interrogated as to this speedy return  and he replied  i embarrassed them  the outside air penetrated to them through me  i produced on them the effect of an open door on another occasion he said  what would you have  those gentlemen are princes  i am only a poor peasant bishop the fact is that he displeased them  among other strange things  it is said that he chanced to remark one evening  when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues  what beautiful clocks what beautiful carpets  what beautiful liveries  they must be a great trouble  i would not have all those superfluities  crying incessantly in my ears  there are people who are hungry  there are people who are cold  there are poor people  there are poor people let us remark  by the way  that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred  this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts nevertheless  in churchmen  luxury is wrong  except in connection with representations and ceremonies  it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them  an opulent priest is a contradiction  the priest must keep close to the poor  now  can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress  all these misfortunes  and this poverty  without having about one s own person a little of that misery  like the dust of labor  is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm  can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace  and who has neither a singed hair  nor blackened nails  nor a drop of sweat  nor a speck of ashes on his face  the first proof of charity in the priest  in the bishop especially  is poverty this is  no doubt  what the bishop of d  thought it must not be supposed  however  that he shared what we call the ideas of the century  on certain delicate points  he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment  and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated  but if he had been strongly pressed  it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican  since we are making a portrait  and since we do not wish to conceal anything  we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline  beginning with  he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations  he refused to see him  as he passed through on his return from the island of elba  and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days besides his sister  mademoiselle baptistine  he had two brothers  one a general  the other a prefect  he wrote to both with tolerable frequency he was harsh for a time towards the former  because  holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes  the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape  his correspondence with the other brother  the ex prefect  a fine  worthy man who lived in retirement at paris  rue cassette  remained more affectionate thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit  his hour of bitterness  his cloud  the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things certainly  such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions  let there be no mistake as to our meaning  we are not confounding what is called political opinions  with the grand aspiration for progress  with the sublime faith  patriotic  democratic humane  which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect  without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book  we will simply say this  it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been  for a single instant  turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible  above the fictions and the hatreds of this world  above the stormy vicissitudes of human things  the beaming of those three pure radiances  truth  justice and charity while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome  we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty  his proud opposition  his just but perilous resistance to the all powerful napoleon  but that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling  we only love the fray so long as there is danger  and in any case  the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last  he who has not been a stubborn accuser in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin  the denunciator of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall  as for us  when providence intervenes and strikes  we let it work   commenced to disarm us  in  the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body  emboldened by catastrophe  possessed only traits which aroused indignation  and it was a crime to applaud  in  in the presence of those marshals who betrayed  in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another  insulting after having deified  in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head  in  when the supreme disasters filled the air  when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach  when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon  the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and  after making all allowance for the despot  a heart like that of the bishop of d  ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss with this exception  he was in all things just  true  equitable intelligent  humble and dignified  beneficent and kindly  which is only another sort of benevolence  he was a priest  a sage  and a man  it must be admitted  that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him  and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy  more so  perhaps  than we who are speaking here  the porter of the town hall had been placed there by the emperor he was an old non commissioned officer of the old guard  a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz  as much of a bonapartist as the eagle this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks  which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches  after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor  he never dressed himself in his regimentals  as he said  so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross  he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him  this made a hole  and he would not put anything in its place  i will die  he said  rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart  he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii  the gouty old creature in english gaiters  he said  let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his  he was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested  prussia and england  he did it so often that he lost his place  there he was  turned out of the house  with his wife and children  and without bread  the bishop sent for him  reproved him gently  and appointed him beadle in the cathedral in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had  by dint of holy deeds and gentle manners  filled the town of d with a sort of tender and filial reverence  even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned  as it were  by the people  the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor  but loved their bishop chapter xii the solitude of monseigneur welcome a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little abbes just as a general is by a covey of young officers  this is what that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere les pretres blancs becs  callow priests  every career has its aspirants  who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it  there is no power which has not its dependents  there is no fortune which has not its court  the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present  every metropolis has its staff of officials  every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary which goes the round  and maintains good order in the episcopal palace and mounts guard over monseigneur s smile  to please a bishop is equivalent to getting one s foot in the stirrup for a sub diaconate it is necessary to walk one s path discreetly  the apostleship does not disdain the canonship just as there are bigwigs elsewhere  there are big mitres in the church these are the bishops who stand well at court  who are rich  well endowed  skilful  accepted by the world  who know how to pray  no doubt but who know also how to beg  who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person  who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy  who are abbes rather than priests prelates rather than bishops  happy those who approach them  being persons of influence  they create a shower about them  upon the assiduous and the favored  and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing  of large parishes  prebends  archidiaconates chaplaincies  and cathedral posts  while awaiting episcopal honors  as they advance themselves  they cause their satellites to progress also it is a whole solar system on the march  their radiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite  their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes  into nice little promotions  the larger the diocese of the patron  the fatter the curacy for the favorite  and then  there is rome a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop  an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal  carries you with him as conclavist you enter a court of papal jurisdiction  you receive the pallium  and behold  you are an auditor  then a papal chamberlain  then monsignor and from a grace to an eminence is only a step  and between the eminence and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot  every skull cap may dream of the tiara  the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner  and what a king  the supreme king  then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary  how many blushing choristers how many youthful abbes bear on their heads perrette s pot of milk who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation  in good faith  perchance  and deceiving itself  devotee that it is monseigneur bienvenu  poor  humble  retiring  was not accounted among the big mitres  this was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him  we have seen that he did not take  in paris  not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow  his canons and grand vicars were good old men rather vulgar like himself  walled up like him in this diocese  without exit to a cardinalship  and who resembled their bishop  with this difference  that they were finished and he was completed  the impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well understood  that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of aix or of auch  and went off in a great hurry  for  in short  we repeat it men wish to be pushed  a saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor  he might communicate to you  by contagion an incurable poverty  an anchylosis of the joints  which are useful in advancement  and in short  more renunciation than you desire  and this infectious virtue is avoided  hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu  we live in the midst of a gloomy society  success  that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption be it said in passing  that success is a very hideous thing  its false resemblance to merit deceives men  for the masses  success has almost the same profile as supremacy  success  that menaechmus of talent  has one dupe history  juvenal and tacitus alone grumble at it  in our day  a philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service  wears the livery of success  and performs the service of its antechamber  succeed  theory  prosperity argues capacity  win in the lottery  and behold  you are a clever man  he who triumphs is venerated be born with a silver spoon in your mouth  everything lies in that  be lucky  and you will have all the rest  be happy  and people will think you great  outside of five or six immense exceptions  which compose the splendor of a century  contemporary admiration is nothing but short sightedness  gilding is gold  it does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance  so long as you do arrive  the common herd is an old narcissus who adores himself  and who applauds the vulgar herd that enormous ability by virtue of which one is moses  aeschylus  dante michael angelo  or napoleon  the multitude awards on the spot  and by acclamation  to whomsoever attains his object  in whatsoever it may consist  let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy  let a false corneille compose tiridate  let a eunuch come to possess a harem  let a military prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe soles for the army of the sambre and meuse  and construct for himself  out of this cardboard  sold as leather  four hundred thousand francs of income  let a pork packer espouse usury  and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions  of which he is the father and of which it is the mother  let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal drawl  let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances and men call that genius  just as they call the face of mousqueton beauty  and the mien of claude majesty  with the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft mire of the puddle by the feet of ducks chapter xiii what he believed we are not obliged to sound the bishop of d  on the score of orthodoxy  in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect  the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word  moreover  certain natures being given  we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own what did he think of this dogma  or of that mystery  these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb  where souls enter naked  the point on which we are certain is  that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case  no decay is possible to the diamond  he believed to the extent of his powers  credo in patrem  he often exclaimed  moreover  he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience  and which whispers to a man  thou art with god the point which we consider it our duty to note is  that outside of and beyond his faith  as it were  the bishop possessed an excess of love  it was in that quarter  quia multum amavit because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men  grave persons  and reasonable people  favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry  what was this excess of love it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men  as we have already pointed out  and which  on occasion  extended even to things  he lived without disdain  he was indulgent towards god s creation  every man even the best  has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals  the bishop of d  had none of that harshness  which is peculiar to many priests  nevertheless  he did not go as far as the brahmin  but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes  who knoweth whither the soul of the animal goeth  hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct  troubled him not  and did not arouse his indignation  he was touched  almost softened by them  it seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent  the cause  the explanation  or the excuse for them  he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties  he examined without wrath  and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest  that portion of chaos which still exists in nature  this revery sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings  one morning he was in his garden  and thought himself alone  but his sister was walking behind him  unseen by him  suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground  it was a large  black  hairy  frightful spider  his sister heard him say poor beast  it is not its fault why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness puerile they may be  but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis d assisi and of marcus aurelius  one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant  thus lived this just man  sometimes he fell asleep in his garden  and then there was nothing more venerable possible monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been  if the stories anent his youth and even in regard to his manhood  were to be believed  a passionate and  possibly  a violent man  his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life  and had trickled there slowly thought by thought  for  in a character  as in a rock  there may exist apertures made by drops of water  these hollows are uneffaceable  these formations are indestructible in  as we think we have already said  he reached his seventy fifth birthday  but he did not appear to be more than sixty  he was not tall he was rather plump  and  in order to combat this tendency  he was fond of taking long strolls on foot  his step was firm  and his form was but slightly bent  a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion  gregory xvi  at the age of eighty  held himself erect and smiling  which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop  monseigneur welcome had what the people term a fine head  but so amiable was he that they forgot that it was fine when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms  and of which we have already spoken  people felt at their ease with him  and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person  his fresh and ruddy complexion  his very white teeth  all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile  gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man  he s a good fellow  and of an old man  he is a fine man  that  it will be recalled  was the effect which he produced upon napoleon  on the first encounter  and to one who saw him for the first time  he was nothing  in fact  but a fine man  but if one remained near him for a few hours  and beheld him in the least degree pensive  the fine man became gradually transfigured  and took on some imposing quality  i know not what  his broad and serious brow  rendered august by his white locks  became august also by virtue of meditation  majesty radiated from his goodness  though his goodness ceased not to be radiant  one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile  respect  an unutterable respect  penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart  and one felt that one had before him one of those strong  thoroughly tried  and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle as we have seen  prayer  the celebration of the offices of religion alms giving  the consolation of the afflicted  the cultivation of a bit of land  fraternity  frugality  hospitality  renunciation  confidence study  work  filled every day of his life  filled is exactly the word certainly the bishop s day was quite full to the brim  of good words and good deeds  nevertheless  it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired  it seemed to be a sort of rite with him  to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens  sometimes  if the two old women were not asleep  they heard him pacing slowly along the walks at a very advanced hour of the night  he was there alone  communing with himself  peaceful  adoring  comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether  moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god  opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown  at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume  illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night  as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation  he could not have told himself  probably  what was passing in his spirit  he felt something take its flight from him  and something descend into him  mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe he thought of the grandeur and presence of god  of the future eternity that strange mystery  of the eternity past  a mystery still more strange  of all the infinities  which pierced their way into all his senses  beneath his eyes  and  without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible  he gazed upon it  he did not study god  he was dazzled by him  he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms  which communicate aspects to matter  reveal forces by verifying them  create individualities in unity  proportions in extent  the innumerable in the infinite  and  through light  produce beauty  these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly  hence life and death he seated himself on a wooden bench  with his back against a decrepit vine  he gazed at the stars  past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees  this quarter of an acre  so poorly planted  so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds  was dear to him  and satisfied his wants what more was needed by this old man  who divided the leisure of his life  where there was so little leisure  between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night  was not this narrow enclosure  with the heavens for a ceiling  sufficient to enable him to adore god in his most divine works  in turn  does not this comprehend all  in fact  and what is there left to desire beyond it  a little garden in which to walk  and immensity in which to dream  at one s feet that which can be cultivated and plucked  over head that which one can study and meditate upon  some flowers on earth  and all the stars in the sky chapter xiv what he thought one last word since this sort of details might  particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion  give to the bishop of d  a certain pantheistical  physiognomy  and induce the belief  either to his credit or discredit  that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century  which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits  and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion  we insist upon it  that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort  that which enlightened this man was his heart  his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there no systems  many works  abstruse speculations contain vertigo  no there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses  the apostle may be daring  but the bishop must be timid  he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are  in a manner  reserved for terrible great minds  there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma  those gloomy openings stand yawning there  but something tells you  you  a passer by in life that you must not enter  woe to him who penetrates thither geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated  so to speak  above all dogmas  propose their ideas to god  their prayer audaciously offers discussion  their adoration interrogates  this is direct religion  which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs human meditation has no limits  at his own risk and peril  it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement  one might almost say  that by a sort of splendid reaction  it with it dazzles nature  the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received  it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated  however that may be there are on earth men who are they men perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revery the heights of the absolute  and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain  monseigneur welcome was one of these men  monseigneur welcome was not a genius  he would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even  like swedenborg and pascal  have slipped into insanity  certainly  these powerful reveries have their moral utility  and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection  as for him  he took the path which shortens the gospel s he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of elijah s mantle  he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events  he did not seek to condense in flame the light of things  he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him  this humble soul loved  and that was all that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable  but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts  saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates  the universe appeared to him like an immense malady  everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering  and  without seeking to solve the enigma  he strove to dress the wound  the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him  he was occupied only in finding for himself  and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve  that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation there are men who toil at extracting gold  he toiled at the extraction of pity  universal misery was his mine  the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness  love each other  he declared this to be complete  desired nothing further  and that was the whole of his doctrine  one day  that man who believed himself to be a philosopher  the senator who has already been alluded to  said to the bishop  just survey the spectacle of the world  all war against all  the strongest has the most wit  your love each other is nonsense well  replied monseigneur welcome  without contesting the point  if it is nonsense  the soul should shut itself up in it  as the pearl in the oyster  thus he shut himself up  he lived there  he was absolutely satisfied with it  leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify  the fathomless perspectives of abstraction  the precipices of metaphysics all those profundities which converge  for the apostle in god  for the atheist in nothingness destiny  good and evil  the way of being against being  the conscience of man  the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal  the transformation in death  the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains  the incomprehensible grafting of successive loves on the persistent i the essence  the substance  the nile  and the ens  the soul  nature liberty  necessity  perpendicular problems  sinister obscurities  where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind  formidable abysses which lucretius  manou  saint paul  dante  contemplate with eyes flashing lightning  which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them  and without troubling his own mind with them  and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness book second the fall chapter i the evening of a day of walking early in the month of october   about an hour before sunset  a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town of d the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness  it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance  he was a man of medium stature  thickset and robust  in the prime of life he might have been forty six or forty eight years old  a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face  burned and tanned by sun and wind  and dripping with perspiration  his shirt of coarse yellow linen  fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor  permitted a view of his hairy breast  he had a cravat twisted into a string  trousers of blue drilling  worn and threadbare  white on one knee and torn on the other  an old gray  tattered blouse  patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twine  a tightly packed soldier knapsack  well buckled and perfectly new  on his back  an enormous knotty stick in his hand  iron shod shoes on his stockingless feet  a shaved head and a long beard the sweat  the heat  the journey on foot  the dust  added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole  his hair was closely cut yet bristling  for it had begun to grow a little  and did not seem to have been cut for some time no one knew him  he was evidently only a chance passer by  whence came he  from the south  from the seashore  perhaps  for he made his entrance into d  by the same street which  seven months previously  had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris  this man must have been walking all day  he seemed very much fatigued  some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade  he must have been very thirsty  for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink  two hundred paces further on  at the fountain in the market place on arriving at the corner of the rue poichevert  he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the town hall  he entered  then came out a quarter of an hour later  a gendarme was seated near the door  on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of d  the proclamation of the gulf juan  the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme the gendarme  without replying to his salute  stared attentively at him followed him for a while with his eyes  and then entered the town hall there then existed at d  a fine inn at the sign of the cross of colbas  this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin labarre  a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another labarre  who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble  and had served in the guides  at the time of the emperor s landing  many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphins  it was said that general bertrand  disguised as a carter  had made frequent trips thither in the month of january  and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of gold to the citizens  the truth is  that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture  he had thanked the mayor  saying  i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance  and he had betaken himself to the three dauphins  this glory of the labarre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the labarre of the cross of colbas  at a distance of five and twenty leagues  it was said of him in the town  that is the cousin of the man of grenoble the man bent his steps towards this inn  which was the best in the country side  he entered the kitchen  which opened on a level with the street  all the stoves were lighted  a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace  the host  who was also the chief cook  was going from one stew pan to another  very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners  whose loud talking  conversation  and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment  any one who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners  a fat marmot  flanked by white partridges and heather cocks was turning on a long spit before the fire  on the stove  two huge carps from lake lauzet and a trout from lake alloz were cooking the host  hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter  said without raising his eyes from his stoves what do you wish  sir food and lodging  said the man nothing easier  replied the host  at that moment he turned his head took in the traveller s appearance with a single glance  and added  by paying for it the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse  and answered  i have money in that case  we are at your service  said the host the man put his purse back in his pocket  removed his knapsack from his back  put it on the ground near the door  retained his stick in his hand  and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire  d  is in the mountains  the evenings are cold there in october but as the host went back and forth  he scrutinized the traveller will dinner be ready soon  said the man immediately  replied the landlord while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire  with his back turned  the worthy host  jacquin labarre  drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window  on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing  and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey  the landlord whispered a word in the scullion s ear  and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town hall the traveller saw nothing of all this once more he inquired  will dinner be ready soon immediately  responded the host the child returned  he brought back the paper  the host unfolded it eagerly  like a person who is expecting a reply  he seemed to read it attentively  then tossed his head  and remained thoughtful for a moment then he took a step in the direction of the traveller  who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene i cannot receive you  sir  said he the man half rose what  are you afraid that i will not pay you  do you want me to pay you in advance  i have money  i tell you it is not that what then you have money yes  said the man and i  said the host  have no room the man resumed tranquilly  put me in the stable i cannot why the horses take up all the space very well  retorted the man  a corner of the loft then  a truss of straw  we will see about that after dinner i cannot give you any dinner this declaration  made in a measured but firm tone  struck the stranger as grave  he rose ah  bah  but i am dying of hunger  i have been walking since sunrise  i have travelled twelve leagues  i pay  i wish to eat i have nothing  said the landlord the man burst out laughing  and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves  nothing  and all that all that is engaged by whom by messieurs the wagoners how many are there of them twelve there is enough food there for twenty they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance the man seated himself again  and said  without raising his voice  i am at an inn  i am hungry  and i shall remain then the host bent down to his ear  and said in a tone which made him start  go away at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron shod tip of his staff  he turned quickly round  and as he opened his mouth to reply  the host gazed steadily at him and added  still in a low voice  stop  there s enough of that sort of talk  do you want me to tell you your name  your name is jean valjean  now do you want me to tell you who you are  when i saw you come in i suspected something  i sent to the town hall  and this was the reply that was sent to me  can you read so saying  he held out to the stranger  fully unfolded  the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town hall  and from the town hall to the inn  the man cast a glance upon it  the landlord resumed after a pause i am in the habit of being polite to every one  go away the man dropped his head  picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground  and took his departure he chose the principal street  he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man  he did not turn round a single time  had he done so  he would have seen the host of the cross of colbas standing on his threshold  surrounded by all the guests of his inn  and all the passers by in the street  talking vivaciously  and pointing him out with his finger  and  from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group  he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town he saw nothing of all this  people who are crushed do not look behind them  they know but too well the evil fate which follows them thus he proceeded for some time  walking on without ceasing  traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing  forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad  all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply  night was drawing near  he glanced about him  to see whether he could not discover some shelter the fine hostelry was closed to him  he was seeking some very humble public house  some hovel  however lowly just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets  a pine branch suspended from a cross beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight  he proceeded thither it proved to be  in fact  a public house  the public house which is in the rue de chaffaut the wayfarer halted for a moment  and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house  illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth  some men were engaged in drinking there  the landlord was warming himself  an iron pot  suspended from a crane  bubbled over the flame the entrance to this public house  which is also a sort of an inn  is by two doors  one opens on the street  the other upon a small yard filled with manure  the traveller dare not enter by the street door  he slipped into the yard  halted again  then raised the latch timidly and opened the door who goes there  said the master some one who wants supper and bed good  we furnish supper and bed here he entered  all the men who were drinking turned round  the lamp illuminated him on one side  the firelight on the other  they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack the host said to him  there is the fire  the supper is cooking in the pot  come and warm yourself  comrade he approached and seated himself near the hearth  he stretched out his feet  which were exhausted with fatigue  to the fire  a fine odor was emitted by the pot  all that could be distinguished of his face  beneath his cap  which was well pulled down  assumed a vague appearance of comfort  mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows it was  moreover  a firm  energetic  and melancholy profile  this physiognomy was strangely composed  it began by seeming humble  and ended by seeming severe  the eye shone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood one of the men seated at the table  however  was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chaffaut  had been to stable his horse at labarre s  it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras d asse and i have forgotten the name  i think it was escoublon  now when he met him  the man  who then seemed already extremely weary  had requested him to take him on his crupper  to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait  this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin labarre  and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colbas  from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern keeper  the tavern keeper went to him  they exchanged a few words in a low tone  the man had again become absorbed in his reflections the tavern keeper returned to the fireplace  laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man  and said to him you are going to get out of here the stranger turned round and replied gently  ah  you know yes i was sent away from the other inn and you are to be turned out of this one where would you have me go elsewhere the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed as he went out  some children who had followed him from the cross of colbas  and who seemed to be lying in wait for him  threw stones at him he retraced his steps in anger  and threatened them with his stick  the children dispersed like a flock of birds he passed before the prison  at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell  he rang the wicket opened turnkey  said he  removing his cap politely  will you have the kindness to admit me  and give me a lodging for the night a voice replied the prison is not an inn  get yourself arrested  and you will be admitted the wicket closed again he entered a little street in which there were many gardens  some of them are enclosed only by hedges  which lends a cheerful aspect to the street  in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story  the window of which was lighted up  he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house  within was a large whitewashed room  with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff  and a cradle in one corner  a few wooden chairs  and a double barrelled gun hanging on the wall  a table was spread in the centre of the room  a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen  the pewter jug shining like silver  and filled with wine  and the brown  smoking soup tureen  at this table sat a man of about forty  with a merry and open countenance  who was dandling a little child on his knees  close by a very young woman was nursing another child  the father was laughing the child was laughing  the mother was smiling the stranger paused a moment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle  what was taking place within him  he alone could have told  it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable  and that  in a place where he beheld so much happiness  he would find perhaps a little pity he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock they did not hear him he tapped again he heard the woman say  it seems to me  husband  that some one is knocking no  replied the husband he tapped a third time the husband rose  took the lamp  and went to the door  which he opened he was a man of lofty stature  half peasant  half artisan  he wore a huge leather apron  which reached to his left shoulder  and which a hammer  a red handkerchief  a powder horn  and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle  as in a pocket  caused to bulge out  he carried his head thrown backwards  his shirt  widely opened and turned back  displayed his bull neck  white and bare  he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers  prominent eyes  the lower part of his face like a snout  and besides all this  that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable pardon me  sir  said the wayfarer  could you  in consideration of payment  give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden  in which to sleep  tell me  can you  for money who are you  demanded the master of the house the man replied  i have just come from puy moisson  i have walked all day long  i have travelled twelve leagues  can you if i pay i would not refuse  said the peasant  to lodge any respectable man who would pay me  but why do you not go to the inn there is no room bah  impossible  this is neither a fair nor a market day  have you been to labarre yes well the traveller replied with embarrassment  i do not know  he did not receive me have you been to what s his name s  in the rue chaffaut the stranger s embarrassment increased  he stammered  he did not receive me either the peasant s countenance assumed an expression of distrust  he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet  and suddenly exclaimed  with a sort of shudder are you the man he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger  took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table  and took his gun down from the wall meanwhile  at the words  are you the man  the woman had risen  had clasped her two children in her arms  and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband  staring in terror at the stranger  with her bosom uncovered  and with frightened eyes  as she murmured in a low tone tso maraude all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one s self  after having scrutinized the man for several moments  as one scrutinizes a viper  the master of the house returned to the door and said clear out for pity s sake  a glass of water  said the man a shot from my gun  said the peasant then he closed the door violently  and the man heard him shoot two large bolts  a moment later  the window shutter was closed  and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside night continued to fall  a cold wind from the alps was blowing  by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived  in one of the gardens which bordered the street  a sort of hut  which seemed to him to be built of sods  he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely  and found himself in the garden  he approached the hut  its door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture  and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct for themselves along the roads  he thought without doubt  that it was  in fact  the dwelling of a road laborer  he was suffering from cold and hunger  but this was  at least  a shelter from the cold  this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night he threw himself flat on his face  and crawled into the hut  it was warm there  and he found a tolerably good bed of straw  he lay  for a moment stretched out on this bed  without the power to make a movement  so fatigued was he  then  as the knapsack on his back was in his way  and as it furnished  moreover  a pillow ready to his hand  he set about unbuckling one of the straps  at that moment  a ferocious growl became audible  he raised his eyes  the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut it was a dog s kennel he was himself vigorous and formidable  he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack  and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could  not without enlarging the rents in his rags he left the garden in the same manner  but backwards  being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful  to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as la rose couverte when he had  not without difficulty  repassed the fence  and found himself once more in the street  alone  without refuge  without shelter without a roof over his head  chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel  he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone  and it appears that a passer by heard him exclaim  i am not even a dog he soon rose again and resumed his march  he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter he walked thus for some time  with his head still drooping  when he felt himself far from every human habitation  he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him  he was in a field  before him was one of those low hills covered with close cut stubble  which  after the harvest resemble shaved heads the horizon was perfectly black  this was not alone the obscurity of night  it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself  and which were mounting and filling the whole sky  meanwhile  as the moon was about to rise  and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight  these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch  whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth the earth was thus better lighted than the sky  which produces a particularly sinister effect  and the hill  whose contour was poor and mean  was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon  the whole effect was hideous  petty  lugubrious  and narrow there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things  nevertheless  there was something in that sky in that hill  in that plain  in that tree  which was so profoundly desolate  that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly  there are instants when nature seems hostile he retraced his steps  the gates of d  were closed  d  which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion  was still surrounded in  by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since  he passed through a breach and entered the town again it might have been eight o clock in the evening  as he was not acquainted with the streets  he recommenced his walk at random in this way he came to the prefecture  then to the seminary  as he passed through the cathedral square  he shook his fist at the church at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment  it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army  brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself  were printed for the first time worn out with fatigue  and no longer entertaining any hope  he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office at that moment an old woman came out of the church  she saw the man stretched out in the shadow  what are you doing there  my friend  said she he answered harshly and angrily  as you see  my good woman  i am sleeping  the good woman  who was well worthy the name  in fact  was the marquise de r on this bench  she went on i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years  said the man to day i have a mattress of stone you have been a soldier yes  my good woman  a soldier why do you not go to the inn because i have no money alas  said madame de r  i have only four sous in my purse give it to me all the same the man took the four sous  madame de r  continued  you cannot obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum  but have you tried  it is impossible for you to pass the night thus  you are cold and hungry  no doubt  some one might have given you a lodging out of charity i have knocked at all doors well i have been driven away everywhere the good woman  touched the man s arm  and pointed out to him on the other side of the street a small  low house  which stood beside the bishop s palace you have knocked at all doors yes have you knocked at that one no knock there chapter ii prudence counselled to wisdom that evening  the bishop of d  after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room  he was busy over a great work on duties  which was never completed  unfortunately  he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject  his book was divided into two parts  firstly  the duties of all  secondly  the duties of each individual  according to the class to which he belongs  the duties of all are the great duties  there are four of these  saint matthew points them out  duties towards god matt  vi  duties towards one s self matt  v    duties towards one s neighbor matt  vii   duties towards animals matt  vi   as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere  to sovereigns and subjects  in the epistle to the romans  to magistrates  to wives  to mothers  to young men  by saint peter  to husbands  fathers  children and servants  in the epistle to the ephesians  to the faithful  in the epistle to the hebrews  to virgins  in the epistle to the corinthians  out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole  which he desired to present to souls at eight o clock he was still at work  writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper  with a big book open on his knees  when madame magloire entered  according to her wont  to get the silver ware from the cupboard near his bed  a moment later  the bishop knowing that the table was set  and that his sister was probably waiting for him  shut his book  rose from his table  and entered the dining room the dining room was an oblong apartment  with a fireplace  which had a door opening on the street as we have said  and a window opening on the garden madame magloire was  in fact  just putting the last touches to the table as she performed this service  she was conversing with mademoiselle baptistine a lamp stood on the table  the table was near the fireplace  a wood fire was burning there one can easily picture to one s self these two women  both of whom were over sixty years of age  madame magloire small  plump  vivacious mademoiselle baptistine gentle  slender  frail  somewhat taller than her brother  dressed in a gown of puce colored silk  of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris  and which had lasted ever since  to borrow vulgar phrases  which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express  madame magloire had the air of a peasant  and mademoiselle baptistine that of a lady  madame magloire wore a white quilted cap  a gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house  a very white fichu puffing out from a gown of coarse black woollen stuff  with large  short sleeves  an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted round the waist with a green ribbon  with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners  coarse shoes on her feet  and yellow stockings  like the women of marseilles  mademoiselle baptistine s gown was cut on the patterns of  with a short waist a narrow  sheath like skirt  puffed sleeves  with flaps and buttons she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig madame magloire had an intelligent  vivacious  and kindly air  the two corners of her mouth unequally raised  and her upper lip  which was larger than the lower  imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look  so long as monseigneur held his peace  she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom  but as soon as monseigneur began to speak  as we have seen  she obeyed passively like her mistress  mademoiselle baptistine did not even speak  she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him  she had never been pretty  even when she was young  she had large  blue  prominent eyes  and a long arched nose  but her whole visage  her whole person  breathed forth an ineffable goodness  as we stated in the beginning  she had always been predestined to gentleness  but faith  charity  hope  those three virtues which mildly warm the soul  had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity  nature had made her a lamb  religion had made her an angel poor sainted virgin  sweet memory which has vanished mademoiselle baptistine has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening  that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details at the moment when the bishop entered  madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity  she was haranguing mademoiselle baptistine on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed  the question concerned the lock upon the entrance door it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper  madame magloire had heard things in divers places  people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance  a suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town  and those who should take it into their heads to return home late that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters  the police was very badly organized  moreover  because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor  who sought to injure each other by making things happen  it behooved wise people to play the part of their own police  and to guard themselves well  and care must be taken to duly close  bar and barricade their houses  and to fasten the doors well madame magloire emphasized these last words  but the bishop had just come from his room  where it was rather cold  he seated himself in front of the fire  and warmed himself  and then fell to thinking of other things  he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire  she repeated it  then mademoiselle baptistine  desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother  ventured to say timidly did you hear what madame magloire is saying  brother i have heard something of it in a vague way  replied the bishop  then half turning in his chair  placing his hands on his knees  and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face  which so easily grew joyous  and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter  what is the matter  are we in any great danger then madame magloire began the whole story afresh  exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact  it appeared that a bohemian  a bare footed vagabond  a sort of dangerous mendicant  was at that moment in the town  he had presented himself at jacquin labarre s to obtain lodgings  but the latter had not been willing to take him in  he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming  a gallows bird with a terrible face really  said the bishop this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire  it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly yes  monseigneur  that is how it is  there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town to night  every one says so  and withal  the police is so badly regulated  a useful repetition  the idea of living in a mountainous country  and not even having lights in the streets at night  one goes out  black as ovens  indeed  and i say  monseigneur  and mademoiselle there says with me i  interrupted his sister  say nothing  what my brother does is well done madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest we say that this house is not safe at all  that if monseigneur will permit  i will go and tell paulin musebois  the locksmith  to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors  we have them  and it is only the work of a moment  for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first passer by  and i say that we need bolts  monseigneur  if only for this night  moreover  monseigneur has the habit of always saying come in and besides  even in the middle of the night  o mon dieu  there is no need to ask permission at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door come in  said the bishop chapter iii the heroism of passive obedience the door opened it opened wide with a rapid movement  as though some one had given it an energetic and resolute push a man entered we already know the man  it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter he entered  advanced a step  and halted  leaving the door open behind him  he had his knapsack on his shoulders  his cudgel in his hand  a rough  audacious  weary  and violent expression in his eyes  the fire on the hearth lighted him up  he was hideous  it was a sinister apparition madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry  she trembled and stood with her mouth wide open mademoiselle baptistine turned round  beheld the man entering  and half started up in terror  then  turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again  she began to observe her brother  and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man as he opened his mouth  doubtless to ask the new comer what he desired the man rested both hands on his staff  directed his gaze at the old man and the two women  and without waiting for the bishop to speak  he said in a loud voice see here  my name is jean valjean  i am a convict from the galleys i have passed nineteen years in the galleys  i was liberated four days ago  and am on my way to pontarlier  which is my destination  i have been walking for four days since i left toulon  i have travelled a dozen leagues to day on foot  this evening  when i arrived in these parts  i went to an inn  and they turned me out  because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the town hall  i had to do it  i went to an inn they said to me  be off  at both places  no one would take me  i went to the prison  the jailer would not admit me  i went into a dog s kennel  the dog bit me and chased me off  as though he had been a man one would have said that he knew who i was  i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air  beneath the stars  there were no stars  i thought it was going to rain  and i re entered the town  to seek the recess of a doorway  yonder  in the square  i meant to sleep on a stone bench  a good woman pointed out your house to me  and said to me  knock there  i have knocked  what is this place  do you keep an inn  i have money savings  one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which i earned in the galleys by my labor  in the course of nineteen years  i will pay  what is that to me  i have money  i am very weary twelve leagues on foot  i am very hungry  are you willing that i should remain madame magloire  said the bishop  you will set another place the man advanced three paces  and approached the lamp which was on the table  stop  he resumed  as though he had not quite understood that s not it  did you hear  i am a galley slave  a convict  i come from the galleys  he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper  which he unfolded  here s my passport  yellow  as you see  this serves to expel me from every place where i go  will you read it  i know how to read  i learned in the galleys  there is a school there for those who choose to learn  hold  this is what they put on this passport  jean valjean  discharged convict  native of that is nothing to you has been nineteen years in the galleys  five years for house breaking and burglary  fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions  he is a very dangerous man  there  every one has cast me out  are you willing to receive me  is this an inn  will you give me something to eat and a bed  have you a stable madame magloire  said the bishop  you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove  we have already explained the character of the two women s obedience madame magloire retired to execute these orders the bishop turned to the man sit down  sir  and warm yourself  we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are supping at this point the man suddenly comprehended  the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh  bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt  of joy  and became extraordinary  he began stammering like a crazy man really  what  you will keep me  you do not drive me forth  a convict you call me sir  you do not address me as thou  get out of here  you dog  is what people always say to me  i felt sure that you would expel me  so i told you at once who i am  oh  what a good woman that was who directed me hither  i am going to sup  a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world  a bed  it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed  you actually do not want me to go  you are good people  besides  i have money  i will pay well  pardon me  monsieur the inn keeper  but what is your name  i will pay anything you ask  you are a fine man  you are an inn keeper  are you not i am  replied the bishop  a priest who lives here a priest  said the man  oh  what a fine priest  then you are not going to demand any money of me  you are the cure  are you not  the cure of this big church  well  i am a fool  truly  i had not perceived your skull cap as he spoke  he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport in his pocket  and seated himself  mademoiselle baptistine gazed mildly at him  he continued you are humane  monsieur le cure  you have not scorned me  a good priest is a very good thing  then you do not require me to pay no  said the bishop  keep your money  how much have you  did you not tell me one hundred and nine francs and fifteen sous  added the man one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous  and how long did it take you to earn that nineteen years nineteen years the bishop sighed deeply the man continued  i have still the whole of my money  in four days i have spent only twenty five sous  which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse  since you are an abbe  i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys  and one day i saw a bishop there  monseigneur is what they call him  he was the bishop of majore at marseilles  he is the cure who rules over the other cures  you understand  pardon me i say that very badly  but it is such a far off thing to me  you understand what we are  he said mass in the middle of the galleys  on an altar  he had a pointed thing  made of gold  on his head  it glittered in the bright light of midday  we were all ranged in lines on the three sides  with cannons with lighted matches facing us  we could not see very well  he spoke  but he was too far off  and we did not hear  that is what a bishop is like while he was speaking  the bishop had gone and shut the door  which had remained wide open madame magloire returned  she brought a silver fork and spoon  which she placed on the table madame magloire  said the bishop  place those things as near the fire as possible  and turning to his guest  the night wind is harsh on the alps  you must be cold  sir each time that he uttered the word sir  in his voice which was so gently grave and polished  the man s face lighted up  monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa  ignominy thirsts for consideration this lamp gives a very bad light  said the bishop madame magloire understood him  and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney piece in monseigneur s bed chamber  and placed them  lighted  on the table monsieur le cure  said the man  you are good  you do not despise me you receive me into your house  you light your candles for me  yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man the bishop  who was sitting close to him  gently touched his hand  you could not help telling me who you were  this is not my house  it is the house of jesus christ  this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name  but whether he has a grief  you suffer  you are hungry and thirsty  you are welcome  and do not thank me  do not say that i receive you in my house  no one is at home here  except the man who needs a refuge  i say to you  who are passing by  that you are much more at home here than i am myself  everything here is yours  what need have i to know your name  besides  before you told me you had one which i knew the man opened his eyes in astonishment really  you knew what i was called yes  replied the bishop  you are called my brother stop  monsieur le cure  exclaimed the man  i was very hungry when i entered here  but you are so good  that i no longer know what has happened to me the bishop looked at him  and said you have suffered much oh  the red coat  the ball on the ankle  a plank to sleep on  heat cold  toil  the convicts  the thrashings  the double chain for nothing the cell for one word  even sick and in bed  still the chain  dogs  dogs are happier  nineteen years  i am forty six  now there is the yellow passport  that is what it is like yes  resumed the bishop  you have come from a very sad place listen  there will be more joy in heaven over the tear bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men  if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind  you are deserving of pity  if you emerge with thoughts of good will and of peace  you are more worthy than any one of us in the meantime  madame magloire had served supper  soup  made with water  oil  bread  and salt  a little bacon  a bit of mutton  figs  a fresh cheese  and a large loaf of rye bread  she had  of her own accord added to the bishop s ordinary fare a bottle of his old mauves wine the bishop s face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures  to table  he cried vivaciously  as was his custom when a stranger supped with him  he made the man sit on his right  mademoiselle baptistine  perfectly peaceable and natural  took her seat at his left the bishop asked a blessing  then helped the soup himself  according to his custom  the man began to eat with avidity all at once the bishop said  it strikes me there is something missing on this table madame magloire had  in fact  only placed the three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary  now  it was the usage of the house  when the bishop had any one to supper  to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the table cloth an innocent ostentation  this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child s play  which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household  which raised poverty into dignity madame magloire understood the remark  went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forks and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth  symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of pontarlier now  in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table  we cannot do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle baptistine s letters to madame boischevron  wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minuteness    this man paid no attention to any one  he ate with the voracity of a starving man  however  after supper he said monsieur le cure of the good god  all this is far too good for me  but i must say that the carters who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do between ourselves  the remark rather shocked me  my brother replied they are more fatigued than i no  returned the man  they have more money  you are poor  i see that plainly  you cannot be even a curate  are you really a cure  ah  if the good god were but just  you certainly ought to be a cure the good god is more than just  said my brother a moment later he added monsieur jean valjean  is it to pontarlier that you are going with my road marked out for me i think that is what the man said  then he went on i must be on my way by daybreak to morrow  travelling is hard  if the nights are cold  the days are hot you are going to a good country  said my brother  during the revolution my family was ruined  i took refuge in franche comte at first  and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands  my will was good  i found plenty to occupy me  one has only to choose  there are paper mills  tanneries  distilleries  oil factories  watch factories on a large scale  steel mills  copper works  twenty iron foundries at least  four of which  situated at lods  at chatillon  at audincourt  and at beure  are tolerably large i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned  then he interrupted himself and addressed me have we not some relatives in those parts  my dear sister i replied we did have some  among others  m  de lucenet  who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime yes  resumed my brother  but in  one had no longer any relatives  one had only one s arms  i worked  they have  in the country of pontarlier  whither you are going  monsieur valjean  a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry  my sister  it is their cheese dairies  which they call fruitieres then my brother  while urging the man to eat  explained to him  with great minuteness  what these fruitieres of pontarlier were  that they were divided into two classes  the big barns which belong to the rich and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer  and the associated fruitieres  which belong to the poor  these are the peasants of mid mountain  who hold their cows in common  and share the proceeds  they engage the services of a cheese maker  whom they call the grurin  the grurin receives the milk of the associates three times a day  and marks the quantity on a double tally  it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese dairies begins  it is towards the middle of june that the cheese makers drive their cows to the mountains the man recovered his animation as he ate  my brother made him drink that good mauves wine  which he does not drink himself  because he says that wine is expensive  my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted  interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me  he recurred frequently to that comfortable trade of grurin  as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly  that this would afford him a refuge  one thing struck me  this man was what i have told you  well neither during supper  nor during the entire evening  did my brother utter a single word  with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered  which could remind the man of what he was  nor of what my brother was  to all appearances  it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon  and of impressing the bishop on the convict  so that a mark of the passage might remain behind  this might have appeared to any one else who had this  unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body  and to bestow upon him some reproach  seasoned with moralizing and advice  or a little commiseration  with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future  my brother did not even ask him from what country he came nor what was his history  for in his history there is a fault  and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it  to such a point did he carry it  that at one time  when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier  who exercise a gentle labor near heaven  and who  he added  are happy because they are innocent  he stopped short  fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man  by dint of reflection  i think i have comprehended what was passing in my brother s heart  he was thinking  no doubt  that this man  whose name is jean valjean  had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind  that the best thing was to divert him from it  and to make him believe  if only momentarily that he was a person like any other  by treating him just in his ordinary way  is not this indeed  to understand charity well  is there not  dear madame  something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon  from moralizing  from allusions  and is not the truest pity  when a man has a sore point  not to touch it at all  it has seemed to me that this might have been my brother s private thought  in any case  what i can say is that  if he entertained all these ideas  he gave no sign of them  from beginning to end  even to me he was the same as he is every evening  and he supped with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m gedeon le provost  or with the curate of the parish towards the end  when he had reached the figs  there came a knock at the door  it was mother gerbaud  with her little one in her arms  my brother kissed the child on the brow  and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud  the man was not paying much heed to anything then  he was no longer talking  and he seemed very much fatigued  after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure  my brother said grace  then he turned to the man and said to him  you must be in great need of your bed  madame magloire cleared the table very promptly  i understood that we must retire  in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep  and we both went up stairs  nevertheless  i sent madame magloire down a moment later  to carry to the man s bed a goat skin from the black forest  which was in my room  the nights are frigid  and that keeps one warm  it is a pity that this skin is old  all the hair is falling out  my brother bought it while he was in germany at tottlingen  near the sources of the danube  as well as the little ivory handled knife which i use at table madame magloire returned immediately  we said our prayers in the drawing room  where we hang up the linen  and then we each retired to our own chambers  without saying a word to each other chapter v tranquillity after bidding his sister good night  monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table  handed the other to his guest  and said to him monsieur  i will conduct you to your room the man followed him as might have been observed from what has been said above  the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated  or to get out of it  it was necessary to traverse the bishop s bedroom at the moment when he was crossing this apartment  madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed this was her last care every evening before she went to bed the bishop installed his guest in the alcove  a fresh white bed had been prepared there  the man set the candle down on a small table well  said the bishop  may you pass a good night  to morrow morning before you set out  you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows thanks  monsieur l abbe  said the man hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace  when all of a sudden  and without transition  he made a strange movement  which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror  had they witnessed it even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment  did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself  he turned abruptly to the old man  folded his arms  and bending upon his host a savage gaze  he exclaimed in a hoarse voice ah  really  you lodge me in your house  close to yourself like this he broke off  and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous have you really reflected well  how do you know that i have not been an assassin the bishop replied that is the concern of the good god then gravely  and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself  he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man  who did not bow  and without turning his head or looking behind him  he returned to his bedroom when the alcove was in use  a large serge curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar  the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer  a moment later he was in his garden walking  meditating  contemplating  his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the eyes which remain open as for the man  he was actually so fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets  snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts  he dropped  all dressed as he was  upon the bed  where he immediately fell into a profound sleep midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house chapter vi jean valjean towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie  he had not learned to read in his childhood  when he reached man s estate  he became a tree pruner at faverolles  his mother was named jeanne mathieu  his father was called jean valjean or vlajean  probably a sobriquet  and a contraction of viola jean  here s jean jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures  on the whole however  there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance  at least  he had lost his father and mother at a very early age  his mother had died of a milk fever  which had not been properly attended to  his father  a tree pruner  like himself  had been killed by a fall from a tree  all that remained to jean valjean was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children  boys and girls  this sister had brought up jean valjean  and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother the husband died  the eldest of the seven children was eight years old the youngest  one jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year  he took the father s place  and  in his turn  supported the sister who had brought him up  this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of jean valjean  thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill paid toil  he had never known a kind woman friend  in his native parts  he had not had the time to fall in love he returned at night weary  and ate his broth without uttering a word his sister  mother jeanne  often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating a bit of meat  a slice of bacon  the heart of the cabbage to give to one of her children  as he went on eating  with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup  his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes  he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it  there was at faverolles  not far from the valjean thatched cottage  on the other side of the lane a farmer s wife named marie claude  the valjean children  habitually famished  sometimes went to borrow from marie claude a pint of milk  in their mother s name  which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner  snatching the jug from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks  if their mother had known of this marauding  she would have punished the delinquents severely  jean valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid marie claude for the pint of milk behind their mother s back  and the children were not punished in pruning season he earned eighteen sous a day  then he hired out as a hay maker  as laborer  as neat herd on a farm  as a drudge  he did whatever he could  his sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children  it was a sad group enveloped in misery  which was being gradually annihilated  a very hard winter came  jean had no work the family had no bread  no bread literally  seven children one sunday evening  maubert isabeau  the baker on the church square at faverolles  was preparing to go to bed  when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop  he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist  through the grating and the glass  the arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off  isabeau ran out in haste  the robber fled at the full speed of his legs  isabeau ran after him and stopped him  the thief had flung away the loaf  but his arm was still bleeding  it was jean valjean this took place in  jean valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night  he had a gun which he used better than any one else in the world he was a bit of a poacher  and this injured his case  there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers  the poacher  like the smuggler smacks too strongly of the brigand  nevertheless  we will remark cursorily  there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns  the poacher lives in the forest  the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea  the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men  the mountain  the sea  the forest make savage men  they develop the fierce side  but often without destroying the humane side jean valjean was pronounced guilty  the terms of the code were explicit there occur formidable hours in our civilization  there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck  what an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummates the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being  jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys on the d of april   the victory of montenotte  won by the general in chief of the army of italy  whom the message of the directory to the five hundred  of the d of floreal  year iv  calls buona parte was announced in paris  on that same day a great gang of galley slaves was put in chains at bicetre  jean valjean formed a part of that gang an old turnkey of the prison  who is now nearly eighty years old  still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line  in the north angle of the courtyard  he was seated on the ground like the others  he did not seem to comprehend his position except that it was horrible  it is probable that he  also  was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man  ignorant of everything  something excessive  while the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer  he wept his tears stifled him  they impeded his speech  he only managed to say from time to time  i was a tree pruner at faverolles  then still sobbing  he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done whatever it was  he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children he set out for toulon  he arrived there  after a journey of twenty seven days  on a cart  with a chain on his neck  at toulon he was clothed in the red cassock  all that had constituted his life  even to his name was effaced  he was no longer even jean valjean  he was number what became of his sister  what became of the seven children  who troubled himself about that  what becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root it is always the same story  these poor living beings  these creatures of god  henceforth without support  without guide  without refuge wandered away at random who even knows each in his own direction perhaps  and little by little buried themselves in that cold mist which engulfs solitary destinies  gloomy shades  into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads  in the sombre march of the human race they quitted the country  the clock tower of what had been their village forgot them  the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them after a few years  residence in the galleys  jean valjean himself forgot them  in that heart  where there had been a wound  there was a scar that is all  only once  during all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned  this happened  i think  towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity  i know not through what channels the news reached him  some one who had known them in their own country had seen his sister  she was in paris  she lived in a poor street rear saint sulpice  in the rue du gindre  she had with her only one child  a little boy  the youngest  where were the other six  perhaps she did not know herself  every morning she went to a printing office no   rue du sabot  where she was a folder and stitcher  she was obliged to be there at six o clock in the morning long before daylight in winter  in the same building with the printing office there was a school  and to this school she took her little boy  who was seven years old  but as she entered the printing office at six  and the school only opened at seven  the child had to wait in the courtyard  for the school to open  for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air  they would not allow the child to come into the printing office  because he was in the way  they said  when the workmen passed in the morning  they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement  overcome with drowsiness  and often fast asleep in the shadow  crouched down and doubled up over his basket  when it rained  an old woman  the portress took pity on him  she took him into her den  where there was a pallet  a spinning wheel  and two wooden chairs  and the little one slumbered in a corner  pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold  at seven o clock the school opened  and he entered  that is what was told to jean valjean they talked to him about it for one day  it was a moment  a flash as though a window had suddenly been opened upon the destiny of those things whom he had loved  then all closed again  he heard nothing more forever  nothing from them ever reached him again  he never beheld them  he never met them again  and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more towards the end of this fourth year jean valjean s turn to escape arrived  his comrades assisted him  as is the custom in that sad place he escaped  he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty  if being at liberty is to be hunted  to turn the head every instant  to quake at the slightest noise  to be afraid of everything of a smoking roof of a passing man  of a barking dog  of a galloping horse  of a striking clock  of the day because one can see  of the night because one cannot see  of the highway  of the path  of a bush  of sleep  on the evening of the second day he was captured  he had neither eaten nor slept for thirty six hours  the maritime tribunal condemned him  for this crime to a prolongation of his term for three years  which made eight years in the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again  he availed himself of it  but could not accomplish his flight fully  he was missing at roll call  the cannon were fired  and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction  he resisted the galley guards who seized him  escape and rebellion  this case  provided for by a special code  was punished by an addition of five years  two of them in the double chain  thirteen years  in the tenth year his turn came round again  he again profited by it  he succeeded no better  three years for this fresh attempt  sixteen years finally  i think it was during his thirteenth year  he made a last attempt  and only succeeded in getting retaken at the end of four hours of absence  three years for those four hours  nineteen years  in october   he was released  he had entered there in  for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread room for a brief parenthesis  this is the second time  during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law  that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny  claude gueux had stolen a loaf jean valjean had stolen a loaf  english statistics prove the fact that four thefts out of five in london have hunger for their immediate cause jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering  he emerged impassive  he had entered in despair  he emerged gloomy what had taken place in that soul chapter vii the interior of despair let us try to say it it is necessary that society should look at these things  because it is itself which creates them he was  as we have said  an ignorant man  but he was not a fool  the light of nature was ignited in him  unhappiness  which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own  augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind  beneath the cudgel  beneath the chain  in the cell  in hardship  beneath the burning sun of the galleys  upon the plank bed of the convict  he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated he constituted himself the tribunal he began by putting himself on trial he recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished  he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act  that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it  that  in any case  it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work  that it is not an unanswerable argument to say  can one wait when one is hungry  that  in the first place  it is very rare for any one to die of hunger  literally  and next  that  fortunately or unfortunately  man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much  both morally and physically  without dying  that it is therefore necessary to have patience  that that would even have been better for those poor little children  that it had been an act of madness for him  a miserable unfortunate wretch  to take society at large violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft  that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters  in short  that he was in the wrong then he asked himself whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history  whether it was not a serious thing  that he  a laborer  out of work  that he  an industrious man  should have lacked bread  and whether  the fault once committed and confessed  the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportioned  whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law  in respect to the penalty  than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault  whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale  in the one which contains expiation  whether the over weight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime  and did not result in reversing the situation  of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression  of converting the guilty man into the victim  and the debtor into the creditor  and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it whether this penalty  complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape  had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler  a crime of society against the individual  a crime which was being committed afresh every day  a crime which had lasted nineteen years he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight  and in the other case for its pitiless foresight  and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess  a default of work and an excess of punishment whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance  and consequently the most deserving of consideration these questions put and answered  he judged society and condemned it he condemned it to his hatred he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering  and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account  he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him  he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not  in truth  unjust  but that it most assuredly was iniquitous anger may be both foolish and absurd  one can be irritated wrongfully one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one s side at bottom  jean valjean felt himself exasperated and besides  human society had done him nothing but harm  he had never seen anything of it save that angry face which it calls justice  and which it shows to those whom it strikes  men had only touched him to bruise him  every contact with them had been a blow  never  since his infancy  since the days of his mother  of his sister  had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance  from suffering to suffering  he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war  and that in this war he was the conquered  he had no other weapon than his hate  he resolved to whet it in the galleys and to bear it away with him when he departed there was at toulon a school for the convicts  kept by the ignorantin friars  where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them  he was of the number who had a mind  he went to school at the age of forty  and learned to read to write  to cipher  he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate  in certain cases  education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil this is a sad thing to say  after having judged society  which had caused his unhappiness  he judged providence  which had made society and he condemned it also thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery  this soul mounted and at the same time fell  light entered it on one side  and darkness on the other jean valjean had not  as we have seen  an evil nature  he was still good when he arrived at the galleys  he there condemned society  and felt that he was becoming wicked  he there condemned providence  and was conscious that he was becoming impious it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom  can the man created good by god be rendered wicked by man  can the soul be completely made over by fate  and become evil  fate being evil  can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath too low a vault  is there not in every human soul  was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular  a first spark  a divine element  incorruptible in this world  immortal in the other  which good can develop  fan  ignite  and make to glow with splendor  and which evil can never wholly extinguish grave and obscure questions  to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no  and that without hesitation  had he beheld at toulon  during the hours of repose  which were for jean valjean hours of revery  this gloomy galley slave  seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan  with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging  serious  silent  and thoughtful a pariah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath  condemned by civilization  and regarding heaven with severity certainly and we make no attempt to dissimulate the fact the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery  he would  perchance  have pitied this sick man  of the law s making  but he would not have even essayed any treatment  he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul  and  like dante at the portals of hell  he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of god has  nevertheless inscribed upon the brow of every man hope was this state of his soul  which we have attempted to analyze  as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us  did jean valjean distinctly perceive  after their formation  and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation  all the elements of which his moral misery was composed  had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had  by degrees  mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had  for so many years  formed the inner horizon of his spirit  was he conscious of all that passed within him  and of all that was working there  that is something which we do not presume to state  it is something which we do not even believe  there was too much ignorance in jean valjean  even after his misfortune  to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there  at times he did not rightly know himself what he felt  jean valjean was in the shadows  he suffered in the shadows  he hated in the shadows  one might have said that he hated in advance of himself  he dwelt habitually in this shadow  feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer  only  at intervals  there suddenly came to him  from without and from within  an access of wrath  a surcharge of suffering  a livid and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul  and caused to appear abruptly all around him  in front  behind  amid the gleams of a frightful light  the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny the flash passed  the night closed in again  and where was he  he no longer knew  the peculiarity of pains of this nature  in which that which is pitiless that is to say  that which is brutalizing predominates  is to transform a man  little by little  by a sort of stupid transfiguration  into a wild beast  sometimes into a ferocious beast jean valjean s successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul jean valjean would have renewed these attempts  utterly useless and foolish as they were  as often as the opportunity had presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result  nor on the experiences which he had already gone through  he escaped impetuously  like the wolf who finds his cage open  instinct said to him  flee  reason would have said  remain  but in the presence of so violent a temptation  reason vanished  nothing remained but instinct  the beast alone acted  when he was recaptured  the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild one detail  which we must not omit  is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys  at work  at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan  jean valjean was worth four men  he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back  and when the occasion demanded it  he replaced that implement which is called a jack screw  and was formerly called orgueil pride  whence  we may remark in passing  is derived the name of the rue montorgueil  near the halles fishmarket  in paris  his comrades had nicknamed him jean the jack screw  once  when they were repairing the balcony of the town hall at toulon  one of those admirable caryatids of puget  which support the balcony  became loosened  and was on the point of falling  jean valjean  who was present  supported the caryatid with his shoulder  and gave the workmen time to arrive his suppleness even exceeded his strength  certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape  ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined  it is the science of muscles  an entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners  men who are forever envious of the flies and birds  to climb a vertical surface  and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible  was play to jean valjean  an angle of the wall being given  with the tension of his back and legs  with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone  he raised himself as if by magic to the third story  he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison he spoke but little  he laughed not at all  an excessive emotion was required to wring from him  once or twice a year  that lugubrious laugh of the convict  which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon  to all appearance  he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible he was absorbed  in fact athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence  he was confusedly conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him  in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance he perceived with terror  mingled with rage  a sort of frightful accumulation of things  collecting and mounting above him  beyond the range of his vision laws  prejudices  men  and deeds whose outlines escaped him  whose mass terrified him  and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization  he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass  now near him  now afar off and on inaccessible table lands  some group  some detail vividly illuminated  here the galley sergeant and his cudgel  there the gendarme and his sword  yonder the mitred archbishop  away at the top like a sort of sun  the emperor  crowned and dazzling  it seemed to him that these distant splendors  far from dissipating his night  rendered it more funereal and more black  all this laws  prejudices  deeds  men things went and came above him  over his head  in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and inexorability in its indifference  souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune  unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbos at which no one any longer looks  the reproved of the law  feel the whole weight of this human society  so formidable for him who is without  so frightful for him who is beneath  resting upon their heads in this situation jean valjean meditated  and what could be the nature of his meditation if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts  it would doubtless  think that same thing which jean valjean thought all these things  realities full of spectres  phantasmagories full of realities  had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable at times  amid his convict toil  he paused  he fell to thinking  his reason  at one and the same time riper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt  everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd  everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible  he said to himself  it is a dream  he gazed at the galley sergeant standing a few paces from him  the galley sergeant seemed a phantom to him  all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel visible nature hardly existed for him  it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun  nor fine summer days nor radiant sky  nor fresh april dawns  i know not what vent hole daylight habitually illumined his soul to sum up  in conclusion  that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out  we will confine ourselves to the statement that  in the course of nineteen years  jean valjean  the inoffensive tree pruner of faverolles  the formidable convict of toulon  had become capable  thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him  of two sorts of evil action firstly  of evil action which was rapid  unpremeditated  dashing entirely instinctive  in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone  secondly  of evil action which was serious  grave consciously argued out and premeditated  with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish  his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases  which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse reasoning  will  perseverance  he had for moving causes his habitual wrath  bitterness of soul  a profound sense of indignities suffered  the reaction even against the good  the innocent  and the just  if there are any such  the point of departure  like the point of arrival  for all his thoughts  was hatred of human law  that hatred which  if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident  becomes  within a given time  the hatred of society  then the hatred of the human race  then the hatred of creation  and which manifests itself by a vague  incessant  and brutal desire to do harm to some living being  no matter whom  it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean valjean s passport described him as a very dangerous man from year to year this soul had dried away slowly  but with fatal sureness  when the heart is dry  the eye is dry  on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a tear chapter viii billows and shadows a man overboard what matters it  the vessel does not halt  the wind blows  that sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue  it passes on the man disappears  then reappears  he plunges  he rises again to the surface  he calls  he stretches out his arms  he is not heard  the vessel  trembling under the hurricane  is wholly absorbed in its own workings  the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves  he gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths  what a spectre is that retreating sail  he gazes and gazes at it frantically  it retreats it grows dim  it diminishes in size  he was there but just now  he was one of the crew  he went and came along the deck with the rest  he had his part of breath and of sunlight  he was a living man  now  what has taken place  he has slipped  he has fallen  all is at an end he is in the tremendous sea  under foot he has nothing but what flees and crumbles  the billows  torn and lashed by the wind  encompass him hideously  the tossings of the abyss bear him away  all the tongues of water dash over his head  a populace of waves spits upon him  confused openings half devour him  every time that he sinks  he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night  frightful and unknown vegetations seize him  knot about his feet  draw him to them  he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss  that he forms part of the foam  the waves toss him from one to another  he drinks in the bitterness  the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously  to drown him  the enormity plays with his agony it seems as though all that water were hate nevertheless  he struggles he tries to defend himself  he tries to sustain himself  he makes an effort  he swims  he  his petty strength all exhausted instantly combats the inexhaustible where  then  is the ship  yonder  barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon the wind blows in gusts  all the foam overwhelms him  he raises his eyes and beholds only the lividness of the clouds  he witnesses  amid his death pangs  the immense madness of the sea  he is tortured by this madness  he hears noises strange to man  which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth  and from one knows not what frightful region beyond there are birds in the clouds  just as there are angels above human distresses  but what can they do for him  they sing and fly and float and he  he rattles in the death agony he feels himself buried in those two infinities  the ocean and the sky at one and the same time  the one is a tomb  the other is a shroud night descends  he has been swimming for hours  his strength is exhausted  that ship  that distant thing in which there were men  has vanished  he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf  he sinks  he stiffens himself  he twists himself  he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible  he shouts there are no more men  where is god he shouts  help  help  he still shouts on nothing on the horizon  nothing in heaven he implores the expanse  the waves  the seaweed  the reef  they are deaf  he beseeches the tempest  the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite around him darkness  fog  solitude  the stormy and nonsentient tumult the undefined curling of those wild waters  in him horror and fatigue beneath him the depths  not a point of support  he thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow  the bottomless cold paralyzes him  his hands contract convulsively  they close  and grasp nothingness  winds  clouds  whirlwinds  gusts  useless stars  what is to be done  the desperate man gives up  he is weary  he chooses the alternative of death  he resists not  he lets himself go  he abandons his grip  and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment oh  implacable march of human societies  oh  losses of men and of souls on the way  ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip disastrous absence of help  oh  moral death the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws fling their condemned  the sea is the immensity of wretchedness the soul  going down stream in this gulf  may become a corpse  who shall resuscitate it chapter ix new troubles when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys  when jean valjean heard in his ear the strange words  thou art free  the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented  a ray of vivid light  a ray of the true light of the living  suddenly penetrated within him  but it was not long before this ray paled  jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty  he had believed in a new life  he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided and this was encompassed with much bitterness  he had calculated that his earnings  during his sojourn in the galleys  ought to amount to a hundred and seventy one francs  it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays and festival days during nineteen years  which entailed a diminution of about eighty francs  at all events  his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous  which had been counted out to him on his departure  he had understood nothing of this  and had thought himself wronged  let us say the word robbed on the day following his liberation  he saw  at grasse  in front of an orange flower distillery  some men engaged in unloading bales  he offered his services  business was pressing  they were accepted  he set to work  he was intelligent  robust  adroit  he did his best  the master seemed pleased  while he was at work  a gendarme passed  observed him  and demanded his papers  it was necessary to show him the yellow passport  that done  jean valjean resumed his labor  a little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation  he had been told thirty sous  when evening arrived  as he was forced to set out again on the following day he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid  the owner did not utter a word  but handed him twenty five sous  he objected  he was told  that is enough for thee  he persisted  the master looked him straight between the eyes  and said to him beware of the prison there  again  he considered that he had been robbed society  the state  by diminishing his hoard  had robbed him wholesale now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail liberation is not deliverance  one gets free from the galleys  but not from the sentence that is what happened to him at grasse  we have seen in what manner he was received at d chapter x the man aroused as the cathedral clock struck two in the morning  jean valjean awoke what woke him was that his bed was too good  it was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed  and  although he had not undressed  the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers he had slept more than four hours  his fatigue had passed away  he was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him  then he closed them again  with the intention of going to sleep once more when many varied sensations have agitated the day  when various matters preoccupy the mind  one falls asleep once  but not a second time sleep comes more easily than it returns  this is what happened to jean valjean  he could not get to sleep again  and he fell to thinking he was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one s mind are troubled  there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain  his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell mell and mingled confusedly  losing their proper forms  becoming disproportionately large  then suddenly disappearing  as in a muddy and perturbed pool  many thoughts occurred to him  but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself afresh  and which drove away all others  we will mention this thought at once  he had observed the six sets of silver forks and spoons and the ladle which madame magloire had placed on the table those six sets of silver haunted him they were there a few paces distant just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was  the old servant woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed he had taken careful note of this cupboard on the right  as you entered from the dining room they were solid and old silver from the ladle one could get at least two hundred francs double what he had earned in nineteen years it is true that he would have earned more if the administration had not robbed him his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle  three o clock struck  he opened his eyes again  drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture  stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack  which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove  then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed and placed his feet on the floor  and thus found himself  almost without knowing it  seated on his bed he remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude  which would have been suggestive of something sinister for any one who had seen him thus in the dark  the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping  all of a sudden he stooped down  removed his shoes and placed them softly on the mat beside the bed  then he resumed his thoughtful attitude  and became motionless once more throughout this hideous meditation  the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain  entered  withdrew re entered  and in a manner oppressed him  and then he thought  also without knowing why  and with the mechanical persistence of revery  of a convict named brevet  whom he had known in the galleys  and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspender of knitted cotton  the checkered pattern of that suspender recurred incessantly to his mind he remained in this situation  and would have so remained indefinitely even until daybreak  had not the clock struck one the half or quarter hour  it seemed to him that that stroke said to him  come on he rose to his feet  hesitated still another moment  and listened  all was quiet in the house  then he walked straight ahead  with short steps to the window  of which he caught a glimpse  the night was not very dark  there was a full moon  across which coursed large clouds driven by the wind  this created  outdoors  alternate shadow and gleams of light eclipses  then bright openings of the clouds  and indoors a sort of twilight  this twilight  sufficient to enable a person to see his way intermittent on account of the clouds  resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air hole in a cellar  before which the passersby come and go  on arriving at the window  jean valjean examined it  it had no grating  it opened in the garden and was fastened  according to the fashion of the country  only by a small pin  he opened it  but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly  he closed it again immediately  he scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks  the garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall  easy to climb  far away  at the extremity  he perceived tops of trees  spaced at regular intervals  which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue or lane planted with trees having taken this survey  he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind  strode to his alcove  grasped his knapsack  opened it  fumbled in it  pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed  put his shoes into one of his pockets  shut the whole thing up again  threw the knapsack on his shoulders  put on his cap  drew the visor down over his eyes  felt for his cudgel  went and placed it in the angle of the window  then returned to the bed  and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there  it resembled a short bar of iron  pointed like a pike at one end  it would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed  perhaps it was a lever  possibly it was a club in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner s candlestick  convicts were  at that period sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ toulon  and it was not rare for them to have miners  tools at their command  these miners  candlesticks are of massive iron  terminated at the lower extremity by a point  by means of which they are stuck into the rock he took the candlestick in his right hand  holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread  he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room  occupied by the bishop  as we already know on arriving at this door  he found it ajar  the bishop had not closed it chapter xi what he does jean valjean listened  not a sound he gave the door a push he pushed it gently with the tip of his finger  lightly  with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering the door yielded to this pressure  and made an imperceptible and silent movement  which enlarged the opening a little he waited a moment  then gave the door a second and a bolder push it continued to yield in silence  the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass  but near the door there stood a little table  which formed an embarrassing angle with it  and barred the entrance jean valjean recognized the difficulty  it was necessary  at any cost to enlarge the aperture still further he decided on his course of action  and gave the door a third push  more energetic than the two preceding  this time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry jean valjean shuddered  the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment in the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated  and had suddenly assumed a terrible life  and that it was barking like a dog to arouse every one and warn and to wake those who were asleep  he halted  shuddering bewildered  and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels  he heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers  and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern  it seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household  like the shock of an earthquake  the door  pushed by him  had taken the alarm  and had shouted  the old man would rise at once  the two old women would shriek out  people would come to their assistance  in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar  and the gendarmerie on hand  for a moment he thought himself lost he remained where he was  petrified like the statue of salt  not daring to make a movement  several minutes elapsed  the door had fallen wide open  he ventured to peep into the next room  nothing had stirred there he lent an ear  nothing was moving in the house  the noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened any one this first danger was past  but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him  nevertheless  he did not retreat  even when he had thought himself lost  he had not drawn back  his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible  he took a step and entered the room this room was in a state of perfect calm  here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable  which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table  open folios  volumes piled upon a stool  an arm chair heaped with clothing  a prie dieu  and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots  jean valjean advanced with precaution  taking care not to knock against the furniture  he could hear  at the extremity of the room  the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping bishop he suddenly came to a halt  he was near the bed  he had arrived there sooner than he had thought for nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness  as though she desired to make us reflect  for the last half hour a large cloud had covered the heavens  at the moment when jean valjean paused in front of the bed this cloud parted  as though on purpose  and a ray of light  traversing the long window  suddenly illuminated the bishop s pale face  he was sleeping peacefully  he lay in his bed almost completely dressed  on account of the cold of the basses alps  in a garment of brown wool which covered his arms to the wrists  his head was thrown back on the pillow  in the careless attitude of repose  his hand  adorned with the pastoral ring  and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions  was hanging over the edge of the bed  his whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction  of hope  and of felicity  it was more than a smile  and almost a radiance  he bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible the soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven a reflection of that heaven rested on the bishop it was  at the same time  a luminous transparency  for that heaven was within him  that heaven was his conscience illustration  the fall  b the fall at the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself  so to speak upon that inward radiance  the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory  it remained  however  gentle and veiled in an ineffable half light  that moon in the sky  that slumbering nature  that garden without a quiver that house which was so calm  the hour  the moment  the silence  added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair  those closed eyes  that face in which all was hope and all was confidence  that head of an old man  and that slumber of an infant there was something almost divine in this man  who was thus august without being himself aware of it jean valjean was in the shadow  and stood motionless  with his iron candlestick in his hand  frightened by this luminous old man  never had he beheld anything like this  this confidence terrified him  the moral world has no grander spectacle than this  a troubled and uneasy conscience  which has arrived on the brink of an evil action contemplating the slumber of the just that slumber in that isolation  and with a neighbor like himself  had about it something sublime  of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious no one could have told what was passing within him  not even himself  in order to attempt to form an idea of it  it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle  even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty  it was a sort of haggard astonishment  he gazed at it  and that was all  but what was his thought  it would have been impossible to divine it  what was evident was  that he was touched and astounded  but what was the nature of this emotion his eye never quitted the old man  the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision  one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses the one in which one loses one s self and that in which one saves one s self  he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand at the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow  and he took off his cap  then his arm fell back with the same deliberation  and jean valjean fell to meditating once more  his cap in his left hand  his club in his right hand  his hair bristling all over his savage head the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze the gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney piece  which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them with a benediction for one and pardon for the other suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow  then stepped rapidly past the bed  without glancing at the bishop  straight to the cupboard which he saw near the head  he raised his iron candlestick as though to force the lock  the key was there  he opened it  the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware  he seized it traversed the chamber with long strides  without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise  gained the door re entered the oratory  opened the window  seized his cudgel  bestrode the window sill of the ground floor  put the silver into his knapsack threw away the basket  crossed the garden  leaped over the wall like a tiger  and fled chapter xii the bishop works the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden  madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation monseigneur  monseigneur  she exclaimed  does your grace know where the basket of silver is yes  replied the bishop jesus the lord be blessed  she resumed  i did not know what had become of it the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed  he presented it to madame magloire here it is well  said she  nothing in it  and the silver ah  returned the bishop  so it is the silver which troubles you  i don t know where it is great  good god  it is stolen  that man who was here last night has stolen it in a twinkling  with all the vivacity of an alert old woman  madame magloire had rushed to the oratory  entered the alcove  and returned to the bishop  the bishop had just bent down  and was sighing as he examined a plant of cochlearia des guillons  which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed  he rose up at madame magloire s cry monseigneur  the man is gone  the silver has been stolen as she uttered this exclamation  her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden  where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible  the coping of the wall had been torn away stay  yonder is the way he went  he jumped over into cochefilet lane ah  the abomination  he has stolen our silver the bishop remained silent for a moment  then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire and  in the first place  was that silver ours madame magloire was speechless  another silence ensued  then the bishop went on madame magloire  i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully  it belonged to the poor  who was that man  a poor man evidently alas  jesus  returned madame magloire  it is not for my sake  nor for mademoiselle s  it makes no difference to us  but it is for the sake of monseigneur  what is monseigneur to eat with now the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement ah  come  are there no such things as pewter forks and spoons madame magloire shrugged her shoulders pewter has an odor iron forks and spoons  then madame magloire made an expressive grimace iron has a taste very well  said the bishop  wooden ones then a few moments later he was breakfasting at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening  as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister  who said nothing  and to madame magloire  who was grumbling under her breath  that one really does not need either fork or spoon  even of wood  in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk a pretty idea  truly  said madame magloire to herself  as she went and came  to take in a man like that  and to lodge him close to one s self and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal  ah  mon dieu  it makes one shudder to think of it as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table  there came a knock at the door come in  said the bishop the door opened  a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold  three men were holding a fourth man by the collar  the three men were gendarmes  the other was jean valjean a brigadier of gendarmes  who seemed to be in command of the group  was standing near the door  he entered and advanced to the bishop  making a military salute monseigneur  said he at this word  jean valjean  who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stupefaction monseigneur  he murmured  so he is not the cure silence  said the gendarme  he is monseigneur the bishop in the meantime  monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted ah  here you are  he exclaimed  looking at jean valjean  i am glad to see you  well  but how is this  i gave you the candlesticks too  which are of silver like the rest  and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs  why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons jean valjean opened his eyes wide  and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of monseigneur  said the brigadier of gendarmes  so what this man said is true  then  we came across him  he was walking like a man who is running away  we stopped him to look into the matter  he had this silver and he told you  interposed the bishop with a smile  that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night  i see how the matter stands  and you have brought him back here  it is a mistake in that case  replied the brigadier  we can let him go certainly  replied the bishop the gendarmes released jean valjean  who recoiled is it true that i am to be released  he said  in an almost inarticulate voice  and as though he were talking in his sleep yes  thou art released  dost thou not understand  said one of the gendarmes my friend  resumed the bishop  before you go  here are your candlesticks  take them he stepped to the chimney piece  took the two silver candlesticks  and brought them to jean valjean  the two women looked on without uttering a word  without a gesture  without a look which could disconcert the bishop jean valjean was trembling in every limb  he took the two candlesticks mechanically  and with a bewildered air now  said the bishop  go in peace  by the way  when you return  my friend  it is not necessary to pass through the garden  you can always enter and depart through the street door  it is never fastened with anything but a latch  either by day or by night then  turning to the gendarmes you may retire  gentlemen the gendarmes retired jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting the bishop drew near to him  and said in a low voice do not forget  never forget  that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man jean valjean  who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless  the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them  he resumed with solemnity jean valjean  my brother  you no longer belong to evil  but to good  it is your soul that i buy from you  i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition  and i give it to god chapter xiii little gervais jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it  he set out at a very hasty pace through the fields  taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him  without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps  he wandered thus the whole morning  without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry  he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations  he was conscious of a sort of rage  he did not know against whom it was directed  he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated  there came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life  this state of mind fatigued him he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him  he asked himself what would replace this  at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes  and that things should not have happened in this way  it would have agitated him less although the season was tolerably far advanced  there were still a few late flowers in the hedge rows here and there  whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood these memories were almost intolerable to him  it was so long since they had recurred to him unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long as the sun declined to its setting  casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble  jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain  which was absolutely deserted  there was nothing on the horizon except the alps  not even the spire of a distant village  jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from d  a path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush in the middle of this meditation  which would have contributed not a little to render his rags terrifying to any one who might have encountered him  a joyous sound became audible he turned his head and saw a little savoyard  about ten years of age coming up the path and singing  his hurdy gurdy on his hip  and his marmot box on his back one of those gay and gentle children  who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers without stopping his song  the lad halted in his march from time to time  and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his hand his whole fortune  probably among this money there was one forty sou piece the child halted beside the bush  without perceiving jean valjean  and tossed up his handful of sous  which  up to that time  he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand this time the forty sou piece escaped him  and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean jean valjean set his foot upon it in the meantime  the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him he showed no astonishment  but walked straight up to the man the spot was absolutely solitary  as far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or on the path  the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage  which was traversing the heavens at an immense height  the child was standing with his back to the sun  which cast threads of gold in his hair and empurpled with its blood red gleam the savage face of jean valjean sir  said the little savoyard  with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence  my money what is your name  said jean valjean little gervais  sir go away  said jean valjean sir  resumed the child  give me back my money jean valjean dropped his head  and made no reply the child began again  my money  sir jean valjean s eyes remained fixed on the earth my piece of money  cried the child  my white piece  my silver it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him  the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him  at the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron shod shoe which rested on his treasure i want my piece of money  my piece of forty sous the child wept  jean valjean raised his head  he still remained seated his eyes were troubled  he gazed at the child  in a sort of amazement then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice  who s there i  sir  replied the child  little gervais  i  give me back my forty sous  if you please  take your foot away  sir  if you please then irritated  though he was so small  and becoming almost menacing come now  will you take your foot away  take your foot away  or we ll see ah  it s still you  said jean valjean  and rising abruptly to his feet  his foot still resting on the silver piece  he added will you take yourself off the frightened child looked at him  then began to tremble from head to foot  and after a few moments of stupor he set out  running at the top of his speed  without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry nevertheless  lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance  and jean valjean heard him sobbing  in the midst of his own revery at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared the sun had set the shadows were descending around jean valjean  he had eaten nothing all day  it is probable that he was feverish he had remained standing and had not changed his attitude after the child s flight  the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals  his gaze  fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him  seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass  all at once he shivered  he had just begun to feel the chill of evening he settled his cap more firmly on his brow  sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse  advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel at that moment he caught sight of the forty sou piece  which his foot had half ground into the earth  and which was shining among the pebbles it was as though he had received a galvanic shock  what is this he muttered between his teeth  he recoiled three paces  then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before  as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin  seized it  and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain  at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon  as he stood there erect and shivering  like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge he saw nothing  night was falling  the plain was cold and vague  great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight he said  ah  and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared  after about thirty paces he paused  looked about him and saw nothing then he shouted with all his might little gervais  little gervais he paused and waited there was no reply the landscape was gloomy and deserted  he was encompassed by space there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost  and a silence which engulfed his voice an icy north wind was blowing  and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life  the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury  one would have said that they were threatening and pursuing some one he set out on his march again  then he began to run  and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude  with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear  little gervais  little gervais assuredly  if the child had heard him  he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself  but the child was no doubt already far away he encountered a priest on horseback  he stepped up to him and said monsieur le cure  have you seen a child pass no  said the priest one named little gervais i have seen no one he drew two five franc pieces from his money bag and handed them to the priest monsieur le cure  this is for your poor people  monsieur le cure  he was a little lad  about ten years old  with a marmot  i think  and a hurdy gurdy  one of those savoyards  you know i have not seen him little gervais  there are no villages here  can you tell me if he is like what you say  my friend  he is a little stranger  such persons pass through these parts  we know nothing of them jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence and gave them to the priest for your poor  he said then he added  wildly monsieur l abbe  have me arrested  i am a thief the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste  much alarmed jean valjean set out on a run  in the direction which he had first taken in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance  gazing  calling shouting  but he met no one  two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down  it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth  at length  at a spot where three paths intersected each other  he stopped  the moon had risen  he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time  little gervais  little gervais  little gervais  his shout died away in the mist  without even awakening an echo  he murmured yet once more  little gervais  but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice  it was his last effort  his legs gave way abruptly under him  as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience  he fell exhausted  on a large stone  his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees  and he cried  i am a wretch then his heart burst  and he began to cry  it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years when jean valjean left the bishop s house  he was  as we have seen quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto  he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him  he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man  you have promised me to become an honest man  i buy your soul i take it away from the spirit of perversity  i give it to the good god this recurred to his mind unceasingly  to this celestial kindness he opposed pride  which is the fortress of evil within us  he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet  that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency  that if he yielded  he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years  and which pleased him  that this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered  and that a struggle  a colossal and final struggle  had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man in the presence of these lights  he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated  as he walked thus with haggard eyes  did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d  did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or importune the spirit at certain moments of life  did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny  that there no longer remained a middle course for him  that if he were not henceforth the best of men  he would be the worst  that it behooved him now  so to speak  to mount higher than the bishop  or fall lower than the convict that if he wished to become good be must become an angel  that if he wished to remain evil  he must become a monster here  again  some questions must be put  which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere  did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought  in a confused way  misfortune certainly  as we have said  does form the education of the intelligence  nevertheless  it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated  if these ideas occurred to him  he but caught glimpses of  rather than saw them  and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion  on emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys  the bishop had hurt his soul  as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark  the future life  the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth  all pure and radiant  filled him with tremors and anxiety  he no longer knew where he really was  like an owl  who should suddenly see the sun rise  the convict had been dazzled and blinded  as it were  by virtue that which was certain  that which he did not doubt  was that he was no longer the same man  that everything about him was changed  that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais  and had robbed him of his forty sous  why  he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort  as it were  of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse  a result of what is called in statics  acquired force  it was that  and it was also  perhaps  even less than that  let us say it simply  it was not he who stole  it was not the man  it was the beast who  by habit and instinct  had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard of thoughts besetting it when intelligence re awakened and beheld that action of the brute  jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror illustration  awakened  b awakened it was because strange phenomenon  and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself in stealing the money from that child  he had done a thing of which he was no longer capable however that may be  this last evil action had a decisive effect on him  it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind  and dispersed it  placed on one side the thick obscurity  and on the other the light  and acted on his soul  in the state in which it then was  as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other first of all  even before examining himself and reflecting  all bewildered  like one who seeks to save himself  he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him  then  when he recognized the fact that this was impossible  he halted in despair  at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch  he had just perceived what he was  and he was already separated from himself to such a degree  that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom  and as if he had there before him  in flesh and blood  the hideous galley convict  jean valjean  cudgel in hand  his blouse on his hips  his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back  with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects excess of unhappiness had  as we have remarked  made him in some sort a visionary  this  then  was in the nature of a vision  he actually saw that jean valjean  that sinister face  before him  he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was  and he was horrified by him his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revery is so profound that it absorbs reality  one no longer beholds the object which one has before one  and one sees  as though apart from one s self  the figures which one has in one s own mind thus he contemplated himself  so to speak  face to face  and at the same time  athwart this hallucination  he perceived in a mysterious depth a sort of light which he at first took for a torch  on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention  he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the bishop and jean valjean  nothing less than the first was required to soften the second  by one of those singular effects  which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies  in proportion as his revery continued  as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes  so did jean valjean grow less and vanish  after a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade  all at once he disappeared  the bishop alone remained  he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance jean valjean wept for a long time  he wept burning tears  he sobbed with more weakness than a woman  with more fright than a child as he wept  daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul  an extraordinary light  a light at once ravishing and terrible  his past life  his first fault  his long expiation  his external brutishness  his internal hardness  his dismissal to liberty  rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance  what had happened to him at the bishop s  the last thing that he had done  that theft of forty sous from a child  a crime all the more cowardly  and all the more monstrous since it had come after the bishop s pardon all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him  but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed he examined his life  and it seemed horrible to him  his soul  and it seemed frightful to him  in the meantime a gentle light rested over this life and this soul  it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise how many hours did he weep thus  what did he do after he had wept whither did he go  no one ever knew  the only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier who served grenoble at that epoch  and who arrived at d  about three o clock in the morning saw  as he traversed the street in which the bishop s residence was situated  a man in the attitude of prayer  kneeling on the pavement in the shadow  in front of the door of monseigneur welcome book third in the year chapter

nearly all these particulars  and cannot do otherwise  the infinity would overwhelm it  nevertheless  these details  which are wrongly called trivial there are no trivial facts in humanity  nor little leaves in vegetation are useful  it is of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is composed  in this year of  four young parisians arranged a fine farce chapter ii a double quartette these parisians came  one from toulouse  another from limoges  the third from cahors  and the fourth from montauban  but they were students  and when one says student  one says parisian  to study in paris is to be born in paris these young men were insignificant  every one has seen such faces  four specimens of humanity taken at random  neither good nor bad  neither wise nor ignorant  neither geniuses nor fools  handsome  with that charming april which is called twenty years  they were four oscars  for at that epoch  arthurs did not yet exist  burn for him the perfumes of araby  exclaimed romance  oscar advances  oscar  i shall behold him people had just emerged from ossian  elegance was scandinavian and caledonian  the pure english style was only to prevail later  and the first of the arthurs  wellington  had but just won the battle of waterloo these oscars bore the names  one of felix tholomyes  of toulouse  the second  listolier  of cahors  the next  fameuil  of limoges  the last blachevelle  of montauban  naturally  each of them had his mistress blachevelle loved favourite  so named because she had been in england listolier adored dahlia  who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower  fameuil idolized zephine  an abridgment of josephine  tholomyes had fantine  called the blonde  because of her beautiful  sunny hair favourite  dahlia  zephine  and fantine were four ravishing young women perfumed and radiant  still a little like working women  and not yet entirely divorced from their needles  somewhat disturbed by intrigues but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman  one of the four was called the young  because she was the youngest of them  and one was called the old  the old one was twenty three  not to conceal anything  the three first were more experienced  more heedless  and more emancipated into the tumult of life than fantine the blonde  who was still in her first illusions dahlia  zephine  and especially favourite  could not have said as much there had already been more than one episode in their romance  though hardly begun  and the lover who had borne the name of adolph in the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second  and gustave in the third  poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors  one scolds and the other flatters  and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in their ear  each on its own side  these badly guarded souls listen  hence the falls which they accomplish  and the stones which are thrown at them  they are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible  alas  what if the jungfrau were hungry favourite having been in england  was admired by dahlia and zephine  she had had an establishment of her own very early in life  her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics  a brutal man and a braggart who went out to give lessons in spite of his age  this professor  when he was a young man  had one day seen a chambermaid s gown catch on a fender  he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident  the result had been favourite  she met her father from time to time  and he bowed to her  one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee had entered her apartments  and had said to her  you do not know me mamemoiselle  no  i am your mother  then the old woman opened the sideboard  and ate and drank  had a mattress which she owned brought in and installed herself  this cross and pious old mother never spoke to favourite  remained hours without uttering a word  breakfasted  dined and supped for four  and went down to the porter s quarters for company where she spoke ill of her daughter it was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn dahlia to listolier  to others perhaps  to idleness  how could she make such nails work  she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands as for zephine  she had conquered fameuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying yes  sir the young men were comrades  the young girls were friends  such loves are always accompanied by such friendships goodness and philosophy are two distinct things  the proof of this is that  after making all due allowances for these little irregular households  favourite  zephine  and dahlia were philosophical young women  while fantine was a good girl good  some one will exclaim  and tholomyes  solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom  we will confine ourselves to saying that the love of fantine was a first love  a sole love  a faithful love she alone  of all the four  was not called thou  by a single one of them fantine was one of those beings who blossom  so to speak  from the dregs of the people  though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow  she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown  she was born at m  sur m  of what parents  who can say  she had never known father or mother  she was called fantine  why fantine  she had never borne any other name  at the epoch of her birth the directory still existed  she had no family name  she had no family  no baptismal name  the church no longer existed  she bore the name which pleased the first random passer by  who had encountered her  when a very small child  running bare legged in the street  she received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained  she was called little fantine  no one knew more than that  this human creature had entered life in just this way  at the age of ten  fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood  at fifteen she came to paris to seek her fortune  fantine was beautiful and remained pure as long as she could  she was a lovely blonde  with fine teeth  she had gold and pearls for her dowry  but her gold was on her head  and her pearls were in her mouth she worked for her living  then  still for the sake of her living for the heart  also  has its hunger she loved she loved tholomyes an amour for him  passion for her  the streets of the latin quarter filled with throngs of students and grisettes  saw the beginning of their dream  fantine had long evaded tholomyes in the mazes of the hill of the pantheon  where so many adventurers twine and untwine  but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again  there is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking  in short  the eclogue took place blachevelle  listolier  and fameuil formed a sort of group of which tholomyes was the head  it was he who possessed the wit tholomyes was the antique old student  he was rich  he had an income of four thousand francs  four thousand francs  a splendid scandal on mount sainte genevieve  tholomyes was a fast man of thirty  and badly preserved  he was wrinkled and toothless  and he had the beginning of a bald spot  of which he himself said with sadness  the skull at thirty the knee at forty  his digestion was mediocre  and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye  but in proportion as his youth disappeared gayety was kindled  he replaced his teeth with buffooneries  his hair with mirth  his health with irony  his weeping eye laughed incessantly he was dilapidated but still in flower  his youth  which was packing up for departure long before its time  beat a retreat in good order bursting with laughter  and no one saw anything but fire  he had had a piece rejected at the vaudeville  he made a few verses now and then  in addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree  which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak  being thus ironical and bald  he was the leader  iron is an english word  is it possible that irony is derived from it one day tholomyes took the three others aside  with the gesture of an oracle  and said to them fantine  dahlia  zephine  and favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise  we have promised them solemnly that we would  they are forever talking about it to us  to me in particular just as the old women in naples cry to saint januarius  faccia gialluta  fa o miracolo  yellow face  perform thy miracle  so our beauties say to me incessantly  tholomyes  when will you bring forth your surprise  at the same time our parents keep writing to us pressure on both sides  the moment has arrived  it seems to me  let us discuss the question thereupon  tholomyes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful  that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously  and blachevelle exclaimed  that is an idea a smoky tap room presented itself  they entered  and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow the result of these shades was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following sunday  the four young men inviting the four young girls chapter iii four and four it is hard nowadays to picture to one s self what a pleasure trip of students and grisettes to the country was like  forty five years ago the suburbs of paris are no longer the same  the physiognomy of what may be called circumparisian life has changed completely in the last half century  where there was the cuckoo  there is the railway car where there was a tender boat  there is now the steamboat  people speak of fecamp nowadays as they spoke of saint cloud in those days  the paris of  is a city which has france for its outskirts the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time  the vacation was beginning  and it was a warm  bright  summer day  on the preceding day  favourite  the only one who knew how to write  had written the following to tholomyes in the name of the four  it is a good hour to emerge from happiness  that is why they rose at five o clock in the morning  then they went to saint cloud by the coach  looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed  this must be very beautiful when there is water  they breakfasted at the tete noir  where castaing had not yet been  they treated themselves to a game of ring throwing under the quincunx of trees of the grand fountain they ascended diogenes  lantern  they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establishment of the pont de sevres  picked bouquets at pateaux  bought reed pipes at neuilly  ate apple tarts everywhere  and were perfectly happy the young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage  it was a perfect delirium  from time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men  matutinal intoxication of life  adorable years the wings of the dragonfly quiver  oh  whoever you may be  do you not remember  have you rambled through the brushwood  holding aside the branches  on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you have you slid  laughing  down a slope all wet with rain  with a beloved woman holding your hand  and crying  ah  my new boots  what a state they are in let us say at once that that merry obstacle  a shower  was lacking in the case of this good humored party  although favourite had said as they set out  with a magisterial and maternal tone  the slugs are crawling in the paths a sign of rain  children all four were madly pretty  a good old classic poet  then famous  a good fellow who had an eleonore  m  le chevalier de labouisse  as he strolled that day beneath the chestnut trees of saint cloud  saw them pass about ten o clock in the morning  and exclaimed  there is one too many of them  as he thought of the graces  favourite  blachevelle s friend  the one aged three and twenty  the old one  ran on in front under the great green boughs  jumped the ditches  stalked distractedly over bushes  and presided over this merry making with the spirit of a young female faun zephine and dahlia  whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together  and completed each other never left each other  more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship  and clinging to each other  they assumed english poses  the first keepsakes had just made their appearance  melancholy was dawning for women  as later on  byronism dawned for men  and the hair of the tender sex began to droop dolefully  zephine and dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls  listolier and fameuil  who were engaged in discussing their professors  explained to fantine the difference that existed between m  delvincourt and m  blondeau blachevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry favourite s single bordered  imitation india shawl of ternaux s manufacture  on his arm on sundays tholomyes followed  dominating the group  he was very gay  but one felt the force of government in him  there was dictation in his joviality his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant leg pattern of nankeen  with straps of braided copper wire  he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand  and  as he treated himself to everything  a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth  nothing was sacred to him  he smoked that tholomyes is astounding  said the others  with veneration  what trousers  what energy as for fantine  she was a joy to behold  her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from god laughter  she preferred to carry her little hat of sewed straw  with its long white strings  in her hand rather than on her head  her thick blond hair  which was inclined to wave  and which easily uncoiled  and which it was necessary to fasten up incessantly  seemed made for the flight of galatea under the willows  her rosy lips babbled enchantingly  the corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up  as in the antique masks of erigone  had an air of encouraging the audacious  but her long  shadowy lashes drooped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt  there was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress  she wore a gown of mauve barege  little reddish brown buskins  whose ribbons traced an x on her fine  white  open worked stockings  and that sort of muslin spencer  a marseilles invention whose name  canezou  a corruption of the words quinze aout  pronounced after the fashion of the canebiere  signifies fine weather  heat  and midday  the three others  less timid  as we have already said wore low necked dresses without disguise  which in summer  beneath flower adorned hats  are very graceful and enticing  but by the side of these audacious outfits  blond fantine s canezou  with its transparencies  its indiscretion  and its reticence  concealing and displaying at one and the same time  seemed an alluring godsend of decency  and the famous court of love  presided over by the vicomtesse de cette  with the sea green eyes  would  perhaps  have awarded the prize for coquetry to this canezou  in the contest for the prize of modesty  the most ingenious is  at times  the wisest  this does happen brilliant of face  delicate of profile  with eyes of a deep blue  heavy lids  feet arched and small  wrists and ankles admirably formed  a white skin which  here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen  joy  a cheek that was young and fresh  the robust throat of the juno of aegina  a strong and supple nape of the neck  shoulders modelled as though by coustou  with a voluptuous dimple in the middle  visible through the muslin  a gayety cooled by dreaminess  sculptural and exquisite such was fantine  and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue  and in that statue a soul fantine was beautiful  without being too conscious of it  those rare dreamers  mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection  would have caught a glimpse in this little working woman  through the transparency of her parisian grace  of the ancient sacred euphony  this daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred she was beautiful in the two ways style and rhythm  style is the form of the ideal  rhythm is its movement we have said that fantine was joy  she was also modesty to an observer who studied her attentively  that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age  the season  and her love affair  was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty  she remained a little astonished  this chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates psyche from venus  fantine had the long white  fine fingers of the vestal virgin who stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin  although she would have refused nothing to tholomyes  as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see  her face in repose was supremely virginal  a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times  and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there  and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state  this sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess  her brow  her nose  her chin  presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion  and from which harmony of countenance results  in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip  she had that imperceptible and charming fold  a mysterious sign of chastity  which makes barberousse fall in love with a diana found in the treasures of iconia love is a fault  so be it  fantine was innocence floating high over fault chapter iv tholomyes is so merry that he sings a spanish ditty that day was composed of dawn  from one end to the other  all nature seemed to be having a holiday  and to be laughing  the flower beds of saint cloud perfumed the air  the breath of the seine rustled the leaves vaguely  the branches gesticulated in the wind  bees pillaged the jasmines  a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow the clover  and the sterile oats  in the august park of the king of france there was a pack of vagabonds  the birds the four merry couples  mingled with the sun  the fields  the flowers the trees  were resplendent and in this community of paradise  talking  singing  running  dancing chasing butterflies  plucking convolvulus  wetting their pink  open work stockings in the tall grass  fresh  wild  without malice  all received to some extent  the kisses of all  with the exception of fantine who was hedged about with that vague resistance of hers composed of dreaminess and wildness  and who was in love  you always have a queer look about you  said favourite to her such things are joys  these passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature  and make a caress and light spring forth from everything  there was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love in that eternal hedge school of lovers which is forever beginning anew  and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars  hence the popularity of spring among thinkers the patrician and the knife grinder  the duke and the peer  the limb of the law  the courtiers and townspeople  as they used to say in olden times  all are subjects of this fairy  they laugh and hunt  and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis what a transfiguration effected by love  notaries  clerks are gods  and the little cries the pursuits through the grass  the waists embraced on the fly  those jargons which are melodies  those adorations which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable  those cherries torn from one mouth by another all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories  beautiful women waste themselves sweetly  they think that this will never come to an end  philosophers  poets  painters  observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it  so greatly are they dazzled by it  the departure for cythera  exclaims watteau  lancret  the painter of plebeians  contemplates his bourgeois  who have flitted away into the azure sky  diderot stretches out his arms to all these love idyls  and d urfe mingles druids with them after breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the king s square to see a newly arrived plant from india  whose name escapes our memory at this moment  and which  at that epoch  was attracting all paris to saint cloud  it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem whose numerous branches  bristling and leafless and as fine as threads were covered with a million tiny white rosettes  this gave the shrub the air of a head of hair studded with flowers  there was always an admiring crowd about it after viewing the shrub  tholomyes exclaimed  i offer you asses  and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses  they returned by way of vanvres and issy  at issy an incident occurred  the truly national park  at that time owned by bourguin the contractor  happened to be wide open  they passed the gates  visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto  tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors  the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of turcaret metamorphosed into a priapus  they had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut trees celebrated by the abbe de bernis as he swung these beauties  one after the other  producing folds in the fluttering skirts which greuze would have found to his taste  amid peals of laughter  the toulousan tholomyes  who was somewhat of a spaniard toulouse being the cousin of tolosa  sang  to a melancholy chant  the old ballad gallega  probably inspired by some lovely maid dashing in full flight upon a rope between two trees       soy de badajoz         badajoz is my home        amor me llama           and love is my name        toda mi alma            to my eyes in flame        es en mi ojos           all my soul doth come        porque ensenas          for instruction meet        a tuas piernas          i receive at thy feet fantine alone refused to swing i don t like to have people put on airs like that  muttered favourite with a good deal of acrimony after leaving the asses there was a fresh delight  they crossed the seine in a boat  and proceeding from passy on foot they reached the barrier of l etoile  they had been up since five o clock that morning as the reader will remember  but bah  there is no such thing as fatigue on sunday  said favourite  on sunday fatigue does not work about three o clock the four couples  frightened at their happiness were sliding down the russian mountains  a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of beaujon  and whose undulating line was visible above the trees of the champs elysees from time to time favourite exclaimed and the surprise  i claim the surprise patience  replied tholomyes chapter v at bombarda s the russian mountains having been exhausted  they began to think about dinner  and the radiant party of eight  somewhat weary at last  became stranded in bombarda s public house  a branch establishment which had been set up in the champs elysees by that famous restaurant keeper bombarda  whose sign could then be seen in the rue de rivoli  near delorme alley a large but ugly room  with an alcove and a bed at the end they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the sunday crowd  two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms  the quay and the river  a magnificent august sunlight lightly touching the panes two tables  upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets  mingled with the hats of men and women  at the other the four couples seated round a merry confusion of platters  dishes  glasses  and bottles  jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine  very little order on the table some disorder beneath it                they made beneath the table      a noise  a clatter of the feet that was abominable says moliere this was the state which the shepherd idyl  begun at five o clock in the morning  had reached at half past four in the afternoon  the sun was setting  their appetites were satisfied the champs elysees  filled with sunshine and with people  were nothing but light and dust  the two things of which glory is composed  the horses of marly  those neighing marbles  were prancing in a cloud of gold  carriages were going and coming  a squadron of magnificent body guards  with their clarions at their head  were descending the avenue de neuilly  the white flag  showing faintly rosy in the setting sun  floated over the dome of the tuileries  the place de la concorde which had become the place louis xv  once more  was choked with happy promenaders  many wore the silver fleur de lys suspended from the white watered ribbon  which had not yet wholly disappeared from button holes in the year  here and there choruses of little girls threw to the winds  amid the passersby  who formed into circles and applauded  the then celebrated bourbon air  which was destined to strike the hundred days with lightning  and which had for its refrain                rendez nous notre pere de gand                     rendez nous notre pere                give us back our father from ghent                     give us back our father groups of dwellers in the suburbs  in sunday array  sometimes even decorated with the fleur de lys  like the bourgeois  scattered over the large square and the marigny square  were playing at rings and revolving on the wooden horses  others were engaged in drinking  some journeyman printers had on paper caps  their laughter was audible  every thing was radiant  it was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security  it was the epoch when a special and private report of chief of police angeles to the king  on the subject of the suburbs of paris terminated with these lines taking all things into consideration  sire  there is nothing to be feared from these people  they are as heedless and as indolent as cats the populace is restless in the provinces  it is not in paris  these are very pretty men  sire  it would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers  there is nothing to be feared on the part of the populace of paris the capital  it is remarkable that the stature of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years  and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the revolution  it is not dangerous  in short  it is an amiable rabble prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion  that does happen  however  and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of paris  moreover  the cat so despised by count angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old  in their eyes it was liberty incarnate  and as though to serve as pendant to the minerva aptera of the piraeus  there stood on the public square in corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat  the ingenuous police of the restoration beheld the populace of paris in too rose colored  a light it is not so much of an amiable rabble  as it is thought  the parisian is to the frenchman what the athenian was to the greek  no one sleeps more soundly than he  no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he  no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness  let him not be trusted nevertheless  he is ready for any sort of cool deed  but when there is glory at the end of it  he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury  give him a pike  he will produce the th of august  give him a gun  you will have austerlitz  he is napoleon s stay and danton s resource  is it a question of country  he enlists  is it a question of liberty  he tears up the pavements  beware  his hair filled with wrath is epic  his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys  take care  he will make of the first rue grenetat which comes to hand caudine forks  when the hour strikes  this man of the faubourgs will grow in stature  this little man will arise  and his gaze will be terrible  and his breath will become a tempest  and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind to disarrange the folds of the alps  it is thanks to the suburban man of paris  that the revolution  mixed with arms  conquers europe  he sings  it is his delight  proportion his song to his nature  and you will see  as long as he has for refrain nothing but la carmagnole  he only overthrows louis xvi  make him sing the marseillaise  and he will free the world this note jotted down on the margin of angles  report  we will return to our four couples  the dinner  as we have said  was drawing to its close chapter vi a chapter in which they adore each other chat at table  the chat of love  it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other  the chat of love is a cloud  the chat at table is smoke fameuil and dahlia were humming  tholomyes was drinking  zephine was laughing  fantine smiling  listolier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at saint cloud favourite gazed tenderly at blachevelle and said blachevelle  i adore you this called forth a question from blachevelle what would you do  favourite  if i were to cease to love you i  cried favourite  ah  do not say that even in jest  if you were to cease to love me  i would spring after you  i would scratch you i should rend you  i would throw you into the water  i would have you arrested blachevelle smiled with the voluptuous self conceit of a man who is tickled in his self love  favourite resumed yes  i would scream to the police  ah  i should not restrain myself not at all  rabble blachevelle threw himself back in his chair  in an ecstasy  and closed both eyes proudly dahlia  as she ate  said in a low voice to favourite  amid the uproar so you really idolize him deeply  that blachevelle of yours i  i detest him  replied favourite in the same tone  seizing her fork again  he is avaricious  i love the little fellow opposite me in my house  he is very nice  that young man  do you know him  one can see that he is an actor by profession  i love actors  as soon as he comes in  his mother says to him  ah  mon dieu  my peace of mind is gone there he goes with his shouting  but  my dear  you are splitting my head  so he goes up to rat ridden garrets  to black holes  as high as he can mount  and there he sets to singing  declaiming  how do i know what  so that he can be heard down stairs  he earns twenty sous a day at an attorney s by penning quibbles  he is the son of a former precentor of saint jacques du haut pas  ah  he is very nice  he idolizes me so that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes  he said to me  mamselle  make your gloves into fritters  and i will eat them  it is only artists who can say such things as that  ah  he is very nice i am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow  never mind  i tell blachevelle that i adore him how i lie  hey  how i do lie favourite paused  and then went on i am sad  you see  dahlia  it has done nothing but rain all summer  the wind irritates me  the wind does not abate  blachevelle is very stingy there are hardly any green peas in the market  one does not know what to eat  i have the spleen  as the english say  butter is so dear  and then you see it is horrible  here we are dining in a room with a bed in it and that disgusts me with life chapter vii the wisdom of tholomyes in the meantime  while some sang  the rest talked together tumultuously all at once  it was no longer anything but noise  tholomyes intervened let us not talk at random nor too fast  he exclaimed  let us reflect if we wish to be brilliant  too much improvisation empties the mind in a stupid way  running beer gathers no froth  no haste  gentlemen  let us mingle majesty with the feast  let us eat with meditation  let us make haste slowly  let us not hurry  consider the springtime  if it makes haste  it is done for  that is to say  it gets frozen  excess of zeal ruins peach trees and apricot trees  excess of zeal kills the grace and the mirth of good dinners  no zeal  gentlemen  grimod de la reyniere agrees with talleyrand a hollow sound of rebellion rumbled through the group leave us in peace  tholomyes  said blachevelle down with the tyrant  said fameuil bombarda  bombance  and bambochel  cried listolier sunday exists  resumed fameuil we are sober  added listolier tholomyes  remarked blachevelle  contemplate my calmness mon calme you are the marquis of that  retorted tholomyes this mediocre play upon words produced the effect of a stone in a pool the marquis de montcalm was at that time a celebrated royalist  all the frogs held their peace friends  cried tholomyes  with the accent of a man who had recovered his empire  come to yourselves  this pun which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stupor  everything which falls in that way is not necessarily worthy of enthusiasm and respect  the pun is the dung of the mind which soars  the jest falls  no matter where and the mind after producing a piece of stupidity plunges into the azure depths  a whitish speck flattened against the rock does not prevent the condor from soaring aloft  far be it from me to insult the pun  i honor it in proportion to its merits  nothing more  all the most august  the most sublime  the most charming of humanity  and perhaps outside of humanity  have made puns  jesus christ made a pun on st  peter  moses on isaac  aeschylus on polynices  cleopatra on octavius  and observe that cleopatra s pun preceded the battle of actium  and that had it not been for it  no one would have remembered the city of toryne  a greek name which signifies a ladle  that once conceded  i return to my exhortation i repeat  brothers  i repeat  no zeal  no hubbub  no excess  even in witticisms  gayety  jollities  or plays on words  listen to me  i have the prudence of amphiaraus and the baldness of caesar  there must be a limit  even to rebuses  est modus in rebus there must be a limit  even to dinners  you are fond of apple turnovers  ladies  do not indulge in them to excess  even in the matter of turnovers  good sense and art are requisite  gluttony chastises the glutton  gula punit gulax  indigestion is charged by the good god with preaching morality to stomachs  and remember this  each one of our passions  even love  has a stomach which must not be filled too full  in all things the word finis must be written in good season  self control must be exercised when the matter becomes urgent  the bolt must be drawn on appetite  one must set one s own fantasy to the violin  and carry one s self to the post  the sage is the man who knows how  at a given moment  to effect his own arrest  have some confidence in me  for i have succeeded to some extent in my study of the law  according to the verdict of my examinations  for i know the difference between the question put and the question pending  for i have sustained a thesis in latin upon the manner in which torture was administered at rome at the epoch when munatius demens was quaestor of the parricide  because i am going to be a doctor  apparently it does not follow that it is absolutely necessary that i should be an imbecile  i recommend you to moderation in your desires  it is true that my name is felix tholomyes i speak well  happy is he who  when the hour strikes  takes a heroic resolve  and abdicates like sylla or origenes favourite listened with profound attention felix  said she  what a pretty word  i love that name  it is latin it means prosper tholomyes went on quirites  gentlemen  caballeros  my friends  do you wish never to feel the prick  to do without the nuptial bed  and to brave love  nothing more simple  here is the receipt  lemonade  excessive exercise  hard labor  work yourself to death  drag blocks  sleep not  hold vigil gorge yourself with nitrous beverages  and potions of nymphaeas  drink emulsions of poppies and agnus castus  season this with a strict diet starve yourself  and add thereto cold baths  girdles of herbs  the application of a plate of lead  lotions made with the subacetate of lead  and fomentations of oxycrat i prefer a woman  said listolier woman  resumed tholomyes  distrust her  woe to him who yields himself to the unstable heart of woman  woman is perfidious and disingenuous she detests the serpent from professional jealousy  the serpent is the shop over the way tholomyes  cried blachevelle  you are drunk pardieu  said tholomyes then be gay  resumed blachevelle i agree to that  responded tholomyes and  refilling his glass  he rose glory to wine  nunc te  bacche  canam  pardon me ladies  that is spanish  and the proof of it  senoras  is this  like people  like cask the arrobe of castile contains sixteen litres  the cantaro of alicante twelve  the almude of the canaries  twenty five  the cuartin of the balearic isles  twenty six  the boot of tzar peter  thirty  long live that tzar who was great  and long live his boot  which was still greater  ladies  take the advice of a friend  make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit  the property of love is to err  a love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an english serving maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing  it is not made for that  it errs gayly  our gentle love  it has been said  error is human  i say  error is love  ladies  i idolize you all  o zephine  o josephine  face more than irregular  you would be charming were you not all askew  you have the air of a pretty face upon which some one has sat down by mistake  as for favourite  o nymphs and muses  one day when blachevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue guerin boisseau he espied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up  which displayed her legs  this prologue pleased him  and blachevelle fell in love  the one he loved was favourite  o favourite  thou hast ionian lips  there was a greek painter named euphorion  who was surnamed the painter of the lips  that greek alone would have been worthy to paint thy mouth  listen  before thee  there was never a creature worthy of the name  thou wert made to receive the apple like venus  or to eat it like eve  beauty begins with thee  i have just referred to eve  it is thou who hast created her  thou deservest the letters patent of the beautiful woman  o favourite  i cease to address you as thou  because i pass from poetry to prose  you were speaking of my name a little while ago that touched me  but let us  whoever we may be  distrust names  they may delude us  i am called felix  and i am not happy  words are liars  let us not blindly accept the indications which they afford us  it would be a mistake to write to liege  for corks  and to pau for gloves  miss dahlia  were i in your place  i would call myself rosa  a flower should smell sweet  and woman should have wit  i say nothing of fantine  she is a dreamer  a musing  thoughtful  pensive person  she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun  who has strayed into the life of a grisette  but who takes refuge in illusions and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing  and who  with her eyes fixed on heaven  wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in existence  o fantine  know this  i  tholomyes  i am all illusion  but she does not even hear me  that blond maid of chimeras  as for the rest everything about her is freshness  suavity  youth  sweet morning light o fantine  maid worthy of being called marguerite or pearl  you are a woman from the beauteous orient  ladies  a second piece of advice  do not marry  marriage is a graft  it takes well or ill  avoid that risk but bah  what am i saying  i am wasting my words  girls are incurable on the subject of marriage  and all that we wise men can say will not prevent the waistcoat makers and the shoe stitchers from dreaming of husbands studded with diamonds  well  so be it  but  my beauties remember this  you eat too much sugar  you have but one fault  o woman and that is nibbling sugar  o nibbling sex  your pretty little white teeth adore sugar  now  heed me well  sugar is a salt  all salts are withering  sugar is the most desiccating of all salts  it sucks the liquids of the blood through the veins  hence the coagulation  and then the solidification of the blood  hence tubercles in the lungs  hence death  that is why diabetes borders on consumption  then  do not crunch sugar  and you will live  i turn to the men  gentlemen  make conquest rob each other of your well beloved without remorse  chassez across in love there are no friends  everywhere where there is a pretty woman hostility is open  no quarter  war to the death  a pretty woman is a casus belli  a pretty woman is flagrant misdemeanor  all the invasions of history have been determined by petticoats  woman is man s right romulus carried off the sabines  william carried off the saxon women caesar carried off the roman women  the man who is not loved soars like a vulture over the mistresses of other men  and for my own part  to all those unfortunate men who are widowers  i throw the sublime proclamation of bonaparte to the army of italy  soldiers  you are in need of everything  the enemy has it tholomyes paused take breath  tholomyes  said blachevelle at the same moment blachevelle  supported by listolier and fameuil struck up to a plaintive air  one of those studio songs composed of the first words which come to hand  rhymed richly and not at all  as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind which have their birth in the vapor of pipes  and are dissipated and take their flight with them  this is the couplet by which the group replied to tholomyes  harangue            the father turkey cocks so grave             some money to an agent gave             that master good clermont tonnerre             might be made pope on saint johns  day fair             but this good clermont could not be             made pope  because no priest was he             and then their agent  whose wrath burned             with all their money back returned this was not calculated to calm tholomyes  improvisation  he emptied his glass  filled  refilled it  and began again down with wisdom  forget all that i have said  let us be neither prudes nor prudent men nor prudhommes  i propose a toast to mirth  be merry let us complete our course of law by folly and eating  indigestion and the digest  let justinian be the male  and feasting  the female  joy in the depths  live  o creation  the world is a great diamond  i am happy the birds are astonishing  what a festival everywhere  the nightingale is a gratuitous elleviou  summer  i salute thee  o luxembourg  o georgics of the rue madame  and of the allee de l observatoire  o pensive infantry soldiers  o all those charming nurses who  while they guard the children  amuse themselves  the pampas of america would please me if i had not the arcades of the odeon  my soul flits away into the virgin forests and to the savannas  all is beautiful  the flies buzz in the sun  the sun has sneezed out the humming bird  embrace me  fantine he made a mistake and embraced favourite chapter viii the death of a horse the dinners are better at edon s than at bombarda s  exclaimed zephine i prefer bombarda to edon  declared blachevelle  there is more luxury  it is more asiatic  look at the room downstairs  there are mirrors glaces  on the walls i prefer them glaces  ices  on my plate  said favourite blachevelle persisted look at the knives  the handles are of silver at bombarda s and of bone at edon s  now  silver is more valuable than bone except for those who have a silver chin  observed tholomyes he was looking at the dome of the invalides  which was visible from bombarda s windows a pause ensued tholomyes  exclaimed fameuil  listolier and i were having a discussion just now a discussion is a good thing  replied tholomyes  a quarrel is better we were disputing about philosophy well which do you prefer  descartes or spinoza desaugiers  said tholomyes this decree pronounced  he took a drink  and went on i consent to live  all is not at an end on earth since we can still talk nonsense  for that i return thanks to the immortal gods  we lie one lies  but one laughs  one affirms  but one doubts  the unexpected bursts forth from the syllogism  that is fine  there are still human beings here below who know how to open and close the surprise box of the paradox merrily  this  ladies  which you are drinking with so tranquil an air is madeira wine  you must know  from the vineyard of coural das freiras  which is three hundred and seventeen fathoms above the level of the sea  attention while you drink  three hundred and seventeen fathoms and monsieur bombarda  the magnificent eating house keeper  gives you those three hundred and seventeen fathoms for four francs and fifty centimes again fameuil interrupted him tholomyes  your opinions fix the law  who is your favorite author ber quin no  choux and tholomyes continued honor to bombarda  he would equal munophis of elephanta if he could but get me an indian dancing girl  and thygelion of chaeronea if he could bring me a greek courtesan  for  oh  ladies  there were bombardas in greece and in egypt  apuleius tells us of them  alas  always the same and nothing new  nothing more unpublished by the creator in creation nil sub sole novum  says solomon  amor omnibus idem  says virgil  and carabine mounts with carabin into the bark at saint cloud  as aspasia embarked with pericles upon the fleet at samos  one last word  do you know what aspasia was  ladies  although she lived at an epoch when women had  as yet  no soul  she was a soul  a soul of a rosy and purple hue  more ardent hued than fire  fresher than the dawn  aspasia was a creature in whom two extremes of womanhood met  she was the goddess prostitute  socrates plus manon lescaut  aspasia was created in case a mistress should be needed for prometheus tholomyes  once started  would have found some difficulty in stopping had not a horse fallen down upon the quay just at that moment  the shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt  it was a beauceron mare  old and thin  and one fit for the knacker  which was dragging a very heavy cart  on arriving in front of bombarda s  the worn out  exhausted beast had refused to proceed any further  this incident attracted a crowd  hardly had the cursing and indignant carter had time to utter with proper energy the sacramental word  matin the jade  backed up with a pitiless cut of the whip  when the jade fell never to rise again  on hearing the hubbub made by the passersby tholomyes  merry auditors turned their heads  and tholomyes took advantage of the opportunity to bring his allocution to a close with this melancholy strophe       elle etait de ce monde ou coucous et carrosses           ont le meme destin       et  rosse  elle a vecu ce que vivant les rosses           l espace d un matin poor horse  sighed fantine and dahlia exclaimed there is fantine on the point of crying over horses  how can one be such a pitiful fool as that at that moment favourite  folding her arms and throwing her head back looked resolutely at tholomyes and said come  now  the surprise exactly  the moment has arrived  replied tholomyes  gentlemen the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck  wait for us a moment  ladies it begins with a kiss  said blachevelle on the brow  added tholomyes each gravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress s brow  then all four filed out through the door  with their fingers on their lips favourite clapped her hands on their departure it is beginning to be amusing already  said she don t be too long  murmured fantine  we are waiting for you chapter ix a merry end to mirth when the young girls were left alone  they leaned two by two on the window sills  chatting  craning out their heads  and talking from one window to the other they saw the young men emerge from the cafe bombarda arm in arm  the latter turned round  made signs to them  smiled  and disappeared in that dusty sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the champs elysees don t be long  cried fantine what are they going to bring us  said zephine it will certainly be something pretty  said dahlia for my part  said favourite  i want it to be of gold their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake  which they could see through the branches of the large trees  and which diverted them greatly it was the hour for the departure of the mail coaches and diligences nearly all the stage coaches for the south and west passed through the champs elysees  the majority followed the quay and went through the passy barrier  from moment to moment  some huge vehicle  painted yellow and black  heavily loaded  noisily harnessed  rendered shapeless by trunks  tarpaulins  and valises  full of heads which immediately disappeared  rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge with dust for smoke  and an air of fury  grinding the pavements changing all the paving stones into steels  this uproar delighted the young girls  favourite exclaimed what a row  one would say that it was a pile of chains flying away it chanced that one of these vehicles  which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms  halted for a moment  then set out again at a gallop  this surprised fantine that s odd  said she  i thought the diligence never stopped favourite shrugged her shoulders this fantine is surprising  i am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity  she is dazzled by the simplest things  suppose a case  i am a traveller  i say to the diligence  i will go on in advance  you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass  the diligence passes  sees me halts  and takes me  that is done every day  you do not know life  my dear in this manner a certain time elapsed  all at once favourite made a movement  like a person who is just waking up well  said she  and the surprise yes  by the way  joined in dahlia  the famous surprise they are a very long time about it  said fantine as fantine concluded this sigh  the waiter who had served them at dinner entered  he held in his hand something which resembled a letter what is that  demanded favourite the waiter replied it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies why did you not bring it at once because  said the waiter  the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour favourite snatched the paper from the waiter s hand  it was  in fact  a letter stop  said she  there is no address  but this is what is written on it                  this is the surprise she tore the letter open hastily  opened it  and read she knew how to read our beloved you must know that we have parents  parents you do not know much about such things  they are called fathers and mothers by the civil code which is puerile and honest  now  these parents groan  these old folks implore us  these good men and these good women call us prodigal sons they desire our return  and offer to kill calves for us  being virtuous we obey them  at the hour when you read this  five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas  we are pulling up our stakes  as bossuet says  we are going  we are gone  we flee in the arms of lafitte and on the wings of caillard  the toulouse diligence tears us from the abyss  and the abyss is you  o our little beauties  we return to society  to duty  to respectability  at full trot  at the rate of three leagues an hour  it is necessary for the good of the country that we should be  like the rest of the world  prefects  fathers of families rural police  and councillors of state  venerate us  we are sacrificing ourselves  mourn for us in haste  and replace us with speed  if this letter lacerates you  do the same by it  adieu for the space of nearly two years we have made you happy  we bear you no grudge for that                                  signed                                             blachevelle                                             famueil                                             listolier                                             felix tholomyes postscriptum  the dinner is paid for the four young women looked at each other favourite was the first to break the silence well  she exclaimed  it s a very pretty farce  all the same it is very droll  said zephine that must have been blachevelle s idea  resumed favourite  it makes me in love with him  no sooner is he gone than he is loved  this is an adventure  indeed no  said dahlia  it was one of tholomyes  ideas  that is evident in that case  retorted favourite  death to blachevelle  and long live tholomyes long live tholomyes  exclaimed dahlia and zephine and they burst out laughing fantine laughed with the rest an hour later  when she had returned to her room  she wept  it was her first love affair  as we have said  she had given herself to this tholomyes as to a husband  and the poor girl had a child book fourth to confide is sometimes to deliver into a person s power chapter i one mother meets another mother there was  at montfermeil  near paris  during the first quarter of this century  a sort of cook shop which no longer exists  this cook shop was kept by some people named thenardier  husband and wife  it was situated in boulanger lane  over the door there was a board nailed flat against the wall  upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back  the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general  with large silver stars  red spots represented blood  the rest of the picture consisted of smoke  and probably represented a battle  below ran this inscription  at the sign of sergeant of waterloo au sargent de waterloo nothing is more common than a cart or a truck at the door of a hostelry nevertheless  the vehicle  or  to speak more accurately  the fragment of a vehicle  which encumbered the street in front of the cook shop of the sergeant of waterloo  one evening in the spring of  would certainly have attracted  by its mass  the attention of any painter who had passed that way it was the fore carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country  and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees  this fore carriage was composed of a massive iron axle tree with a pivot  into which was fitted a heavy shaft  and which was supported by two huge wheels  the whole thing was compact overwhelming  and misshapen  it seemed like the gun carriage of an enormous cannon  the ruts of the road had bestowed on the wheels  the fellies  the hub  the axle  and the shaft  a layer of mud  a hideous yellowish daubing hue  tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals  the wood was disappearing under mud  and the iron beneath rust  under the axle tree hung  like drapery  a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict  this chain suggested  not the beams  which it was its office to transport  but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness  it had the air of the galleys  but of cyclopean and superhuman galleys  and it seemed to have been detached from some monster  homer would have bound polyphemus with it  and shakespeare  caliban why was that fore carriage of a truck in that place in the street  in the first place  to encumber the street  next  in order that it might finish the process of rusting  there is a throng of institutions in the old social order  which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors  and which have no other reasons for existence than the above the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle  and in the loop  as in the rope of a swing  there were seated and grouped  on that particular evening  in exquisite interlacement  two little girls one about two years and a half old  the other  eighteen months  the younger in the arms of the other  a handkerchief  cleverly knotted about them  prevented their falling out  a mother had caught sight of that frightful chain  and had said  come  there s a plaything for my children the two children  who were dressed prettily and with some elegance  were radiant with pleasure  one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron  their eyes were a triumph  their fresh cheeks were full of laughter  one had chestnut hair  the other  brown  their innocent faces were two delighted surprises  a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them  the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood  above and around these two delicate heads  all made of happiness and steeped in light  the gigantic fore carriage  black with rust  almost terrible  all entangled in curves and wild angles  rose in a vault  like the entrance of a cavern  a few paces apart  crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry  the mother  not a very prepossessing woman  by the way  though touching at that moment  was swinging the two children by means of a long cord watching them carefully  for fear of accidents  with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity  at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound  which resembled a cry of rage  the little girls were in ecstasies  the setting sun mingled in this joy  and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim as she rocked her little ones  the mother hummed in a discordant voice a romance then celebrated                  it must be  said a warrior her song  and the contemplation of her daughters  prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street in the meantime  some one had approached her  as she was beginning the first couplet of the romance  and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear you have two beautiful children there  madame                  to the fair and tender imogene replied the mother  continuing her romance  then she turned her head a woman stood before her  a few paces distant  this woman also had a child  which she carried in her arms she was carrying  in addition  a large carpet bag  which seemed very heavy this woman s child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold  it was a girl  two or three years of age  she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones  so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned  she wore a cap of fine linen ribbons on her bodice  and valenciennes lace on her cap  the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white  firm  and dimpled leg  she was admirably rosy and healthy  the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks  of her eyes nothing could be known  except that they must be very large  and that they had magnificent lashes  she was asleep she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age  the arms of mothers are made of tenderness  in them children sleep profoundly as for the mother  her appearance was sad and poverty stricken  she was dressed like a working woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again  she was young  was she handsome  perhaps  but in that attire it was not apparent  her hair  a golden lock of which had escaped  seemed very thick  but was severely concealed beneath an ugly  tight  close nun like cap  tied under the chin  a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them  but she did not smile  her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time  she was pale  she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance  she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child  a large blue handkerchief  such as the invalides use  was folded into a fichu  and concealed her figure clumsily  her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles  her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle  she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff  a linen gown and coarse shoes  it was fantine it was fantine  but difficult to recognize  nevertheless  on scrutinizing her attentively  it was evident that she still retained her beauty  a melancholy fold  which resembled the beginning of irony wrinkled her right cheek  as for her toilette  that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons  which seemed made of mirth  of folly  and of music full of bells  and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoar frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce what had taken place during those ten months  it can be divined after abandonment  straightened circumstances  fantine had immediately lost sight of favourite  zephine and dahlia  the bond once broken on the side of the men  it was loosed between the women  they would have been greatly astonished had any one told them a fortnight later  that they had been friends  there no longer existed any reason for such a thing fantine had remained alone  the father of her child gone alas  such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated  minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure  drawn away by her liaison with tholomyes to disdain the pretty trade which she knew  she had neglected to keep her market open  it was now closed to her  she had no resource  fantine barely knew how to read  and did not know how to write  in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public letter writer indite an epistle to tholomyes  then a second  then a third  tholomyes replied to none of them  fantine heard the gossips say  as they looked at her child  who takes those children seriously  one only shrugs one s shoulders over such children  then she thought of tholomyes  who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously  and her heart grew gloomy toward that man  but what was she to do  she no longer knew to whom to apply  she had committed a fault  but the foundation of her nature  as will be remembered  was modesty and virtue  she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress  and of gliding into a worse state  courage was necessary  she possessed it  and held herself firm  the idea of returning to her native town of m  sur m  occurred to her  there  some one might possibly know her and give her work  yes  but it would be necessary to conceal her fault  in a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one  her heart contracted  but she took her resolution  fantine  as we shall see  had the fierce bravery of life she had already valiantly renounced finery  had dressed herself in linen  and had put all her silks  all her ornaments  all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter  the only vanity which was left to her  and a holy one it was  she sold all that she had  which produced for her two hundred francs  her little debts paid  she had only about eighty francs left  at the age of twenty two  on a beautiful spring morning  she quitted paris  bearing her child on her back  any one who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them  this woman had in all the world  nothing but her child  and the child had  in all the world  no one but this woman  fantine had nursed her child  and this had tired her chest  and she coughed a little we shall have no further occasion to speak of m  felix tholomyes  let us confine ourselves to saying  that  twenty years later  under king louis philippe  he was a great provincial lawyer  wealthy and influential  a wise elector  and a very severe juryman  he was still a man of pleasure towards the middle of the day  after having  from time to time  for the sake of resting herself  travelled  for three or four sous a league  in what was then known as the petites voitures des environs de paris  the little suburban coach service  fantine found herself at montfermeil in the alley boulanger as she passed the thenardier hostelry  the two little girls  blissful in the monster swing  had dazzled her in a manner  and she had halted in front of that vision of joy charms exist  these two little girls were a charm to this mother she gazed at them in much emotion  the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise  she thought that  above this inn  she beheld the mysterious here of providence  these two little creatures were evidently happy  she gazed at them  she admired them  in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets of her song  she could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read you have two pretty children  madame the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young the mother raised her head and thanked her  and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door  she herself being seated on the threshold  the two women began to chat my name is madame thenardier  said the mother of the two little girls we keep this inn then  her mind still running on her romance  she resumed humming between her teeth                  it must be so  i am a knight                   and i am off to palestine this madame thenardier was a sandy complexioned woman  thin and angular the type of the soldier s wife in all its unpleasantness  and what was odd  with a languishing air  which she owed to her perusal of romances  she was a simpering  but masculine creature  old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cook shop woman  she was still young  she was barely thirty  if this crouching woman had stood upright  her lofty stature and her frame of a perambulating colossus suitable for fairs  might have frightened the traveller at the outset  troubled her confidence  and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish  a person who is seated instead of standing erect destinies hang upon such a thing as that the traveller told her story  with slight modifications that she was a working woman  that her husband was dead  that her work in paris had failed her  and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere  in her own native parts  that she had left paris that morning on foot  that  as she was carrying her child  and felt fatigued  she had got into the villemomble coach when she met it  that from villemomble she had come to montfermeil on foot  that the little one had walked a little  but not much  because she was so young  and that she had been obliged to take her up  and the jewel had fallen asleep at this word she bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss  which woke her  the child opened her eyes  great blue eyes like her mother s  and looked at what  nothing  with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children  which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue  one would say that they feel themselves to be angels  and that they know us to be men  then the child began to laugh  and although the mother held fast to her  she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run  all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short  and put out her tongue  in sign of admiration mother thenardier released her daughters  made them descend from the swing  and said now amuse yourselves  all three of you children become acquainted quickly at that age  and at the expiration of a minute the little thenardiers were playing with the new comer at making holes in the ground  which was an immense pleasure the new comer was very gay  the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child  she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel  and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly  the grave digger s business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child the two women pursued their chat what is your little one s name cosette for cosette  read euphrasie  the child s name was euphrasie  but out of euphrasie the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into pepita  and francoise into sillette  it is a sort of derivative which disarranges and disconcerts the whole science of etymologists  we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into gnon how old is she she is going on three that is the age of my eldest in the meantime  the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissfulness  an event had happened  a big worm had emerged from the ground  and they were afraid  and they were in ecstasies over it their radiant brows touched each other  one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole how easily children get acquainted at once  exclaimed mother thenardier  one would swear that they were three sisters this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for  she seized the thenardier s hand  looked at her fixedly and said will you keep my child for me the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent nor refusal cosette s mother continued you see  i cannot take my daughter to the country  my work will not permit it  with a child one can find no situation  people are ridiculous in the country  it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn  when i caught sight of your little ones  so pretty  so clean  and so happy it overwhelmed me  i said  here is a good mother  that is just the thing  that will make three sisters  and then  it will not be long before i return  will you keep my child for me i must see about it  replied the thenardier i will give you six francs a month here a man s voice called from the depths of the cook shop not for less than seven francs  and six months paid in advance six times seven makes forty two  said the thenardier i will give it  said the mother and fifteen francs in addition for preliminary expenses  added the man s voice total  fifty seven francs  said madame thenardier  and she hummed vaguely  with these figures                  it must be  said a warrior i will pay it  said the mother  i have eighty francs  i shall have enough left to reach the country  by travelling on foot  i shall earn money there  and as soon as i have a little i will return for my darling the man s voice resumed the little one has an outfit that is my husband  said the thenardier of course she has an outfit  the poor treasure i understood perfectly that it was your husband and a beautiful outfit  too  a senseless outfit  everything by the dozen  and silk gowns like a lady  it is here in my carpet bag you must hand it over  struck in the man s voice again of course i shall give it to you  said the mother  it would be very queer if i were to leave my daughter quite naked the master s face appeared that s good  said he the bargain was concluded  the mother passed the night at the inn  gave up her money and left her child  fastened her carpet bag once more  now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit  and light henceforth and set out on the following morning  intending to return soon  people arrange such departures tranquilly  but they are despairs a neighbor of the thenardiers met this mother as she was setting out and came back with the remark i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart when cosette s mother had taken her departure  the man said to the woman that will serve to pay my note for one hundred and ten francs which falls due to morrow  i lacked fifty francs  do you know that i should have had a bailiff and a protest after me  you played the mouse trap nicely with your young ones without suspecting it  said the woman chapter ii first sketch of two unprepossessing figures the mouse which had been caught was a pitiful specimen  but the cat rejoices even over a lean mouse who were these thenardiers let us say a word or two of them now  we will complete the sketch later on these beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful  and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale  which is between the class called middle  and the class denominated as inferior  and which combines some of the defects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first  without possessing the generous impulse of the workingman nor the honest order of the bourgeois they were of those dwarfed natures which  if a dull fire chances to warm them up  easily become monstrous  there was in the woman a substratum of the brute  and in the man the material for a blackguard  both were susceptible  in the highest degree  of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil  there exist crab like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness retrograding in life rather than advancing  employing experience to augment their deformity  growing incessantly worse  and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever augmenting blackness  this man and woman possessed such souls thenardier  in particular  was troublesome for a physiognomist  one can only look at some men to distrust them  for one feels that they are dark in both directions  they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front  there is something of the unknown about them  one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do  the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces them  from merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture  one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future this thenardier  if he himself was to be believed  had been a soldier a sergeant  he said  he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor  it would seem  we shall see later on how much truth there was in this  the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his feats of arms  he had painted it himself  for he knew how to do a little of everything  and badly it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which  after having been clelie  was no longer anything but lodoiska  still noble but ever more and more vulgar  having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame bournon malarme  and from madame de lafayette to madame barthelemy hadot  was setting the loving hearts of the portresses of paris aflame  and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent  madame thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books  she lived on them  in them she drowned what brains she possessed  this had given her  when very young  and even a little later  a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband  a scamp of a certain depth  a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar  coarse and fine at one and the same time  but  so far as sentimentalism was concerned  given to the perusal of pigault lebrun  and in what concerns the sex  as he said in his jargon a downright  unmitigated lout  his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was  later on  when her hair  arranged in a romantically drooping fashion  began to grow gray  when the magaera began to be developed from the pamela  the female thenardier was nothing but a coarse  vicious woman  who had dabbled in stupid romances  now one cannot read nonsense with impunity  the result was that her eldest daughter was named eponine  as for the younger  the poor little thing came near being called gulnare  i know not to what diversion  effected by a romance of ducray dumenil  she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of azelma however  we will remark by the way  everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluding  and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names  by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom  it is not rare for the neatherd s boy nowadays to bear the name of arthur  alfred  or alphonse  and for the vicomte if there are still any vicomtes to be called thomas  pierre  or jacques  this displacement  which places the elegant  name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocrat  is nothing else than an eddy of equality the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else  beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution chapter iii the lark it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper  the cook shop was in a bad way thanks to the traveller s fifty seven francs  thenardier had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature  on the following month they were again in need of money  the woman took cosette s outfit to paris  and pawned it at the pawnbroker s for sixty francs  as soon as that sum was spent  the thenardiers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity and they treated her accordingly  as she had no longer any clothes  they dressed her in the cast off petticoats and chemises of the thenardier brats  that is to say  in rags  they fed her on what all the rest had left a little better than the dog  a little worse than the cat moreover  the cat and the dog were her habitual table companions cosette ate with them under the table  from a wooden bowl similar to theirs the mother  who had established herself  as we shall see later on  at m sur m  wrote  or  more correctly  caused to be written  a letter every month  that she might have news of her child  the thenardiers replied invariably  cosette is doing wonderfully well at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month  and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month  the year was not completed when thenardier said  a fine favor she is doing us  in sooth  what does she expect us to do with her seven francs  and he wrote to demand twelve francs  the mother  whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy  and was coming on well  submitted  and forwarded the twelve francs certain natures cannot love on the one hand without hating on the other mother thenardier loved her two daughters passionately  which caused her to hate the stranger it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects  little as was the space occupied by cosette  it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own  and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed  this woman  like many women of her sort  had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day  if she had not had cosette  it is certain that her daughters  idolized as they were  would have received the whole of it  but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself  her daughters received nothing but caresses  cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement  the sweet  feeble being  who should not have understood anything of this world or of god  incessantly punished  scolded  ill used  beaten  and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself  who lived in a ray of dawn madame thenardier was vicious with cosette  eponine and azelma were vicious  children at that age are only copies of their mother  the size is smaller  that is all a year passed  then another people in the village said those thenardiers are good people  they are not rich  and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands they thought that cosette s mother had forgotten her in the meanwhile  thenardier  having learned  it is impossible to say by what obscure means  that the child was probably a bastard  and that the mother could not acknowledge it  exacted fifteen francs a month  saying that the creature  was growing and eating  and threatening to send her away  let her not bother me  he exclaimed  or i ll fire her brat right into the middle of her secrets  i must have an increase  the mother paid the fifteen francs from year to year the child grew  and so did her wretchedness as long as cosette was little  she was the scape goat of the two other children  as soon as she began to develop a little  that is to say before she was even five years old  she became the servant of the household five years old  the reader will say  that is not probable  alas  it is true  social suffering begins at all ages  have we not recently seen the trial of a man named dumollard  an orphan turned bandit  who  from the age of five  as the official documents state  being alone in the world worked for his living and stole cosette was made to run on errands  to sweep the rooms  the courtyard the street  to wash the dishes  to even carry burdens  the thenardiers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner since the mother  who was still at m  sur m  had become irregular in her payments  some months she was in arrears if this mother had returned to montfermeil at the end of these three years  she would not have recognized her child  cosette  so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house  was now thin and pale  she had an indescribably uneasy look  the sly creature  said the thenardiers injustice had made her peevish  and misery had made her ugly  nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes  which inspired pain  because large as they were  it seemed as though one beheld in them a still larger amount of sadness it was a heart breaking thing to see this poor child  not yet six years old  shivering in the winter in her old rags of linen  full of holes sweeping the street before daylight  with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands  and a tear in her great eyes illustration  cossette sweeping  b cossette sweeping she was called the lark in the neighborhood  the populace  who are fond of these figures of speech  had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling  frightened  and shivering little creature  no bigger than a bird  who was awake every morning before any one else in the house or the village  and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak only the little lark never sang book fifth the descent chapter i the history of a progress in black glass trinkets and in the meantime  what had become of that mother who according to the people at montfermeil  seemed to have abandoned her child  where was she  what was she doing after leaving her little cosette with the thenardiers  she had continued her journey  and had reached m  sur m this  it will be remembered  was in fantine had quitted her province ten years before  m  sur m  had changed its aspect  while fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness  her native town had prospered about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place this detail is important  and we regard it as useful to develop it at length  we should almost say  to underline it from time immemorial  m  sur m  had had for its special industry the imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany  this industry had always vegetated  on account of the high price of the raw material  which reacted on the manufacture  at the moment when fantine returned to m  sur m  an unheard of transformation had taken place in the production of black goods  towards the close of  a man a stranger  had established himself in the town  and had been inspired with the idea of substituting  in this manufacture  gum lac for resin and  for bracelets in particular  slides of sheet iron simply laid together  for slides of soldered sheet iron this very small change had effected a revolution this very small change had  in fact  prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material  which had rendered it possible in the first place  to raise the price of manufacture  a benefit to the country  in the second place  to improve the workmanship  an advantage to the consumer  in the third place  to sell at a lower price  while trebling the profit  which was a benefit to the manufacturer thus three results ensued from one idea in less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich which is good  and had made every one about him rich  which is better he was a stranger in the department  of his origin  nothing was known of the beginning of his career  very little  it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money  a few hundred francs at the most it was from this slender capital  enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea  developed by method and thought  that he had drawn his own fortune  and the fortune of the whole countryside on his arrival at m  sur m  he had only the garments  the appearance and the language of a workingman it appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of m  sur m  just at nightfall  on a december evening knapsack on back and thorn club in hand  a large fire had broken out in the town hall  this man had rushed into the flames and saved  at the risk of his own life  two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie  this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport afterwards they had learned his name  he was called father madeleine chapter ii madeleine he was a man about fifty years of age  who had a preoccupied air  and who was good  that was all that could be said about him thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably re constructed  m  sur m  had become a rather important centre of trade spain  which consumes a good deal of black jet  made enormous purchases there each year  m  sur m  almost rivalled london and berlin in this branch of commerce  father madeleine s profits were such  that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory  in which there were two vast workrooms  one for the men  and the other for women any one who was hungry could present himself there  and was sure of finding employment and bread  father madeleine required of the men good will  of the women pure morals  and of all  probity  he had separated the work rooms in order to separate the sexes  and so that the women and girls might remain discreet  on this point he was inflexible  it was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant  he was all the more firmly set on this severity  since m  sur m  being a garrison town opportunities for corruption abounded  however  his coming had been a boon  and his presence was a godsend  before father madeleine s arrival everything had languished in the country  now everything lived with a healthy life of toil  a strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere  slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown there was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it  no dwelling so lowly that there was not some little joy within it father madeleine gave employment to every one  he exacted but one thing be an honest man  be an honest woman as we have said  in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot  father madeleine made his fortune  but a singular thing in a simple man of business  it did not seem as though that were his chief care  he appeared to be thinking much of others  and little of himself  in  he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte  but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs  he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor the hospital was badly endowed  he founded six beds there  m  sur m  is divided into the upper and the lower town  the lower town  in which he lived  had but one school  a miserable hovel  which was falling to ruin he constructed two  one for girls  the other for boys  he allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors  a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary  and one day he said to some one who expressed surprise  the two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster  he created at his own expense an infant school  a thing then almost unknown in france  and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen  as his factory was a centre  a new quarter  in which there were a good many indigent families  rose rapidly around him  he established there a free dispensary at first  when they watched his beginnings  the good souls said  he s a jolly fellow who means to get rich  when they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself  the good souls said  he is an ambitious man  this seemed all the more probable since the man was religious  and even practised his religion to a certain degree  a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch  he went regularly to low mass every sunday  the local deputy  who nosed out all rivalry everywhere  soon began to grow uneasy over this religion  this deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the empire  and shared the religious ideas of a father of the oratoire  known under the name of fouche  duc d otrante  whose creature and friend he had been  he indulged in gentle raillery at god with closed doors  but when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going to low mass at seven o clock he perceived in him a possible candidate  and resolved to outdo him  he took a jesuit confessor  and went to high mass and to vespers  ambition was at that time  in the direct acceptation of the word  a race to the steeple  the poor profited by this terror as well as the good god  for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital  which made twelve nevertheless  in  a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that  on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country  father madeleine was to be appointed by the king  mayor of m  sur m  those who had pronounced this new comer to be an ambitious fellow  seized with delight on this opportunity which all men desire  to exclaim  there what did we say  all m  sur m  was in an uproar  the rumor was well founded  several days later the appointment appeared in the moniteur  on the following day father madeleine refused in this same year of  the products of the new process invented by madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition  when the jury made their report  the king appointed the inventor a chevalier of the legion of honor  a fresh excitement in the little town  well  so it was the cross that he wanted  father madeleine refused the cross decidedly this man was an enigma  the good souls got out of their predicament by saying  after all  he is some sort of an adventurer we have seen that the country owed much to him  the poor owed him everything  he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him  his workmen  in particular  adored him  and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity when he was known to be rich  people in society  bowed to him  and he received invitations in the town  he was called  in town  monsieur madeleine  his workmen and the children continued to call him father madeleine  and that was what was most adapted to make him smile  in proportion as he mounted  throve  invitations rained down upon him society  claimed him for its own  the prim little drawing rooms on m  sur m  which  of course  had at first been closed to the artisan opened both leaves of their folding doors to the millionnaire  they made a thousand advances to him  he refused this time the good gossips had no trouble  he is an ignorant man  of no education  no one knows where he came from  he would not know how to behave in society  it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read when they saw him making money  they said  he is a man of business when they saw him scattering his money about  they said  he is an ambitious man  when he was seen to decline honors  they said  he is an adventurer  when they saw him repulse society  they said  he is a brute in  five years after his arrival in m  sur m  the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling  the opinion of the whole country round about was so unanimous  that the king again appointed him mayor of the town  he again declined  but the prefect resisted his refusal  all the notabilities of the place came to implore him  the people in the street besought him  the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting  it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people  who called to him from her threshold  in an angry way  a good mayor is a useful thing  is he drawing back before the good which he can do this was the third phase of his ascent  father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine  monsieur madeleine became monsieur le maire chapter iii sums deposited with laffitte on the other hand  he remained as simple as on the first day  he had gray hair  a serious eye  the sunburned complexion of a laborer  the thoughtful visage of a philosopher  he habitually wore a hat with a wide brim  and a long coat of coarse cloth  buttoned to the chin  he fulfilled his duties as mayor  but  with that exception  he lived in solitude  he spoke to but few people  he avoided polite attentions he escaped quickly  he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking  he gave  in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling  the women said of him  what a good natured bear  his pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields he always took his meals alone  with an open book before him  which he read  he had a well selected little library  he loved books  books are cold but safe friends  in proportion as leisure came to him with fortune  he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind  it had been observed that  ever since his arrival at m  sur m  his language had grown more polished  more choice  and more gentle with every passing year  he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls  but he rarely made use of it  when he did happen to do so  his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror  he never killed an inoffensive animal  he never shot at a little bird although he was no longer young  it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong  he offered his assistance to any one who was in need of it  lifted a horse  released a wheel clogged in the mud  or stopped a runaway bull by the horns  he always had his pockets full of money when he went out  but they were empty on his return  when he passed through a village  the ragged brats ran joyously after him  and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats it was thought that he must  in the past  have lived a country life since he knew all sorts of useful secrets  which he taught to the peasants  he taught them how to destroy scurf on wheat  by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt  and how to chase away weevils by hanging up orviot in bloom everywhere  on the walls and the ceilings  among the grass and in the houses he had recipes  for exterminating from a field  blight  tares  foxtail and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat  he defended a rabbit warren against rats  simply by the odor of a guinea pig which he placed in it one day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles he examined the plants  which were uprooted and already dried  and said they are dead  nevertheless  it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them  when the nettle is young  the leaf makes an excellent vegetable  when it is older  it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax  nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth  chopped up  nettles are good for poultry  pounded  they are good for horned cattle  the seed of the nettle  mixed with fodder  gives gloss to the hair of animals  the root  mixed with salt  produces a beautiful yellow coloring matter moreover  it is an excellent hay  which can be cut twice  and what is required for the nettle  a little soil  no care  no culture  only the seed falls as it is ripe  and it is difficult to collect it  that is all  with the exercise of a little care  the nettle could be made useful  it is neglected and it becomes hurtful  it is exterminated  how many men resemble the nettle  he added  after a pause  remember this my friends  there are no such things as bad plants or bad men  there are only bad cultivators the children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts when he saw the door of a church hung in black  he entered  he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings  widowhood and the grief of others attracted him  because of his great gentleness  he mingled with the friends clad in mourning  with families dressed in black  with the priests groaning around a coffin  he seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psalmodies filled with the vision of the other world  with his eyes fixed on heaven  he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite  those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death he performed a multitude of good actions  concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions  he penetrated houses privately  at night  he ascended staircases furtively  a poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened sometimes even forced  during his absence  the poor man made a clamor over it  some malefactor had been there  he entered  and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten on some piece of furniture  the malefactor  who had been there was father madeleine he was affable and sad  the people said  there is a rich man who has not a haughty air  there is a happy man who has not a contented air some people maintained that he was a mysterious person  and that no one ever entered his chamber  which was a regular anchorite s cell furnished with winged hour glasses and enlivened by cross bones and skulls of dead men  this was much talked of  so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of m  sur m  came to him one day  and asked monsieur le maire  pray show us your chamber  it is said to be a grotto  he smiled  and introduced them instantly into this grotto they were well punished for their curiosity  the room was very simply furnished in mahogany  which was rather ugly  like all furniture of that sort  and hung with paper worth twelve sous  they could see nothing remarkable about it  except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney piece and appeared to be silver  for they were hall marked  an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns nevertheless  people continued to say that no one ever got into the room  and that it was a hermit s cave  a mysterious retreat  a hole  a tomb it was also whispered about that he had immense  sums deposited with laffitte  with this peculiar feature  that they were always at his immediate disposal  so that  it was added  m  madeleine could make his appearance at laffitte s any morning  sign a receipt  and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes  in reality  these two or three millions  were reducible  as we have said  to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs chapter iv m  madeleine in mourning at the beginning of  the newspapers announced the death of m myriel  bishop of d  surnamed monseigneur bienvenu  who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty two the bishop of d  to supply here a detail which the papers omitted had been blind for many years before his death  and content to be blind  as his sister was beside him let us remark by the way  that to be blind and to be loved  is  in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth where nothing is complete  to have continually at one s side a woman  a daughter  a sister  a charming being  who is there because you need her and because she cannot do without you  to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us  to be able to incessantly measure one s affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us and to say to ourselves  since she consecrates the whole of her time to me  it is because i possess the whole of her heart  to behold her thought in lieu of her face  to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world  to regard the rustle of a gown as the sound of wings  to hear her come and go  retire  speak  return sing  and to think that one is the centre of these steps  of this speech  to manifest at each instant one s personal attraction  to feel one s self all the more powerful because of one s infirmity  to become in one s obscurity  and through one s obscurity  the star around which this angel gravitates few felicities equal this  the supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved  loved for one s own sake let us say rather  loved in spite of one s self  this conviction the blind man possesses  to be served in distress is to be caressed  does he lack anything  no  one does not lose the sight when one has love  and what love  a love wholly constituted of virtue  there is no blindness where there is certainty  soul seeks soul  gropingly and finds it  and this soul  found and tested  is a woman  a hand sustains you  it is hers  a mouth lightly touches your brow  it is her mouth  you hear a breath very near you  it is hers  to have everything of her  from her worship to her pity  never to be left  to have that sweet weakness aiding you  to lean upon that immovable reed  to touch providence with one s hands  and to be able to take it in one s arms god made tangible what bliss  the heart  that obscure celestial flower  undergoes a mysterious blossoming  one would not exchange that shadow for all brightness  the angel soul is there uninterruptedly there  if she departs  it is but to return again  she vanishes like a dream  and reappears like reality  one feels warmth approaching  and behold  she is there  one overflows with serenity  with gayety  with ecstasy  one is a radiance amid the night  and there are a thousand little cares  nothings  which are enormous in that void  the most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you  and supplying the vanished universe to you  one is caressed with the soul one sees nothing  but one feels that one is adored  it is a paradise of shadows it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the other the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m sur m  on the following day  m  madeleine appeared clad wholly in black and with crape on his hat this mourning was noticed in the town  and commented on  it seemed to throw a light on m  madeleine s origin  it was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop  he has gone into mourning for the bishop of d  said the drawing rooms  this raised m  madeleine s credit greatly  and procured for him  instantly and at one blow  a certain consideration in the noble world of m  sur m  the microscopic faubourg saint germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against m  madeleine  the probable relative of a bishop m  madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained  by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones  one evening  a ruler in that petty great world  who was curious by right of seniority  ventured to ask him  m  le maire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d he said  no  madame but  resumed the dowager  you are wearing mourning for him he replied  it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth another thing which was remarked  was  that every time that he encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep  the mayor had him summoned inquired his name  and gave him money  the little savoyards told each other about it  a great many of them passed that way chapter v vague flashes on the horizon little by little  and in the course of time  all this opposition subsided  there had at first been exercised against m  madeleine in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to blackening and calumnies  then they grew to be nothing more than ill nature  then merely malicious remarks  then even this entirely disappeared  respect became complete  unanimous  cordial  and towards  the moment arrived when the word monsieur le maire  was pronounced at m  sur m  with almost the same accent as monseigneur the bishop had been pronounced in d  in  people came from a distance of ten leagues around to consult m  madeleine  he put an end to differences he prevented lawsuits  he reconciled enemies  every one took him for the judge  and with good reason  it seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law  it was like an epidemic of veneration  which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district one single man in the town  in the arrondissement  absolutely escaped this contagion  and  whatever father madeleine did  remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy  it seems  in fact  as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct  though pure and upright  like all instincts  which creates antipathies and sympathies which fatally separates one nature from another nature  which does not hesitate  which feels no disquiet  which does not hold its peace and which never belies itself  clear in its obscurity  infallible imperious  intractable  stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dissolvents of reason  and which  in whatever manner destinies are arranged  secretly warns the man dog of the presence of the man cat  and the man fox of the presence of the man lion it frequently happened that when m  madeleine was passing along a street  calm  affectionate  surrounded by the blessings of all  a man of lofty stature  clad in an iron gray frock coat  armed with a heavy cane  and wearing a battered hat  turned round abruptly behind him  and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared  with folded arms and a slow shake of the head  and his upper lip raised in company with his lower to his nose  a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by  what is that man  after all  i certainly have seen him somewhere  in any case  i am not his dupe this person  grave with a gravity which was almost menacing  was one of those men who  even when only seen by a rapid glimpse  arrest the spectator s attention his name was javert  and he belonged to the police at m  sur m  he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector  he had not seen madeleine s beginnings  javert owed the post which he occupied to the protection of m  chabouillet  the secretary of the minister of state  comte angeles  then prefect of police at paris when javert arrived at m  sur m  the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made  and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy  which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes  we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to some one of the species of the animal creation  and we could easily recognize this truth  hardly perceived by the thinker  that from the oyster to the eagle  from the pig to the tiger  all animals exist in man  and that each one of them is in a man sometimes even several of them at a time animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices straying before our eyes  the visible phantoms of our souls  god shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect  only since animals are mere shadows  god has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word  what is the use  on the contrary  our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them  god has bestowed on them intelligence  that is to say  the possibility of education  social education  when well done  can always draw from a soul  of whatever sort it may be  the utility which it contains this  be it said  is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent  and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man  the visible i  in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent i  having made this reservation  let us pass on now  if the reader will admit  for a moment  with us  that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation  it will be easy for us to say what there was in police officer javert the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog  which is killed by the mother because  otherwise  as he grew up  he would devour the other little ones give to this dog son of a wolf a human face  and the result will be javert javert had been born in prison  of a fortune teller  whose husband was in the galleys  as he grew up  he thought that he was outside the pale of society  and he despaired of ever re entering it  he observed that society unpardoningly excludes two classes of men those who attack it and those who guard it  he had no choice except between these two classes  at the same time  he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity  regularity  and probity  complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung  he entered the police  he succeeded there  at forty years of age he was an inspector during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the south before proceeding further  let us come to an understanding as to the words  human face  which we have just applied to javert the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose  with two deep nostrils  towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks  one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time  when javert laughed and his laugh was rare and terrible his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums  and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold  as on the muzzle of a wild beast  javert  serious  was a watchdog when he laughed  he was a tiger  as for the rest  he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw  his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows  between his eyes there was a permanent  central frown  like an imprint of wrath  his gaze was obscure  his mouth pursed up and terrible  his air that of ferocious command this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparatively  but he rendered them almost bad  by dint of exaggerating them respect for authority  hatred of rebellion  and in his eyes murder  robbery  all crimes  are only forms of rebellion  he enveloped in a blind and profound faith every one who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman  he covered with scorn aversion  and disgust every one who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil  he was absolute  and admitted no exceptions  on the one hand he said  the functionary can make no mistake  the magistrate is never the wrong  on the other hand  he said  these men are irremediably lost  nothing good can come from them  he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power of making  or  if the reader will have it so  of authenticating  demons and who place a styx at the base of society  he was stoical  serious austere  a melancholy dreamer  humble and haughty  like fanatics  his glance was like a gimlet  cold and piercing  his whole life hung on these two words  watchfulness and supervision  he had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness  the religion of his functions  and he was a spy as other men are priests  woe to the man who fell into his hands  he would have arrested his own father  if the latter had escaped from the galleys  and would have denounced his mother  if she had broken her ban  and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue  and  withal a life of privation  isolation  abnegation  chastity  with never a diversion  it was implacable duty  the police understood  as the spartans understood sparta  a pitiless lying in wait  a ferocious honesty  a marble informer  brutus in vidocq javert s whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation  the mystical school of joseph de maistre  which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers  would not have failed to declare that javert was a symbol  his brow was not visible  it disappeared beneath his hat  his eyes were not visible  since they were lost under his eyebrows  his chin was not visible  for it was plunged in his cravat  his hands were not visible  they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible  he carried it under his coat  but when the occasion presented itself  there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow  as from an ambuscade  a narrow and angular forehead  a baleful glance  a threatening chin  enormous hands  and a monstrous cudgel in his leisure moments  which were far from frequent  he read  although he hated books  this caused him to be not wholly illiterate  this could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech as we have said  he had no vices  when he was pleased with himself he permitted himself a pinch of snuff  therein lay his connection with humanity the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice designates under the rubric  vagrants  the name of javert routed them by its mere utterance  the face of javert petrified them at sight such was this formidable man javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m  madeleine  an eye full of suspicion and conjecture  m  madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him  he did not even put a question to javert  he neither sought nor avoided him  he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it he treated javert with ease and courtesy  as he did all the rest of the world it was divined  from some words which escaped javert  that he had secretly investigated  with that curiosity which belongs to the race and into which there enters as much instinct as will  all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere  he seemed to know  and he sometimes said in covert words  that some one had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared  once he chanced to say  as he was talking to himself  i think i have him  then he remained pensive for three days  and uttered not a word  it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken moreover  and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present  there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature  and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused  thrown off the track  and defeated otherwise  it would be superior to intelligence  and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of m  madeleine one day  nevertheless  his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on m  madeleine  it was on the following occasion chapter vi father fauchelevent one morning m  madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m  sur m  he heard a noise  and saw a group some distance away  he approached an old man named father fauchelevent had just fallen beneath his cart his horse having tumbled down this fauchelevent was one of the few enemies whom m  madeleine had at that time  when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood  fauchelevent  an ex notary and a peasant who was almost educated  had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way  fauchelevent had seen this simple workman grow rich  while he  a lawyer  was being ruined  this had filled him with jealousy  and he had done all he could  on every occasion to injure madeleine  then bankruptcy had come  and as the old man had nothing left but a cart and a horse  and neither family nor children  he had turned carter the horse had two broken legs and could not rise  the old man was caught in the wheels  the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast  the cart was quite heavily laden  father fauchelevent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner they had tried  but in vain  to drag him out  an unmethodical effort aid awkwardly given  a wrong shake  might kill him  it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him javert  who had come up at the moment of the accident  had sent for a jack screw m  madeleine arrived  people stood aside respectfully help  cried old fauchelevent  who will be good and save the old man m  madeleine turned towards those present is there a jack screw to be had one has been sent for  answered the peasant how long will it take to get it they have gone for the nearest  to flachot s place  where there is a farrier  but it makes no difference  it will take a good quarter of an hour a quarter of an hour  exclaimed madeleine it had rained on the preceding night  the soil was soaked the cart was sinking deeper into the earth every moment  and crushing the old carter s breast more and more  it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour  said madeleine to the peasants  who were staring at him we must but it will be too late then  don t you see that the cart is sinking well listen  resumed madeleine  there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back  only half a minute  and the poor man can be taken out  is there any one here who has stout loins and heart  there are five louis d or to be earned not a man in the group stirred ten louis  said madeleine the persons present dropped their eyes  one of them muttered  a man would need to be devilish strong  and then he runs the risk of getting crushed come  began madeleine again  twenty louis the same silence it is not the will which is lacking  said a voice m  madeleine turned round  and recognized javert  he had not noticed him on his arrival javert went on it is strength  one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lift a cart like that on his back then  gazing fixedly at m  madeleine  he went on  emphasizing every word that he uttered monsieur madeleine  i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask madeleine shuddered javert added  with an air of indifference  but without removing his eyes from madeleine he was a convict ah  said madeleine in the galleys at toulon madeleine turned pale meanwhile  the cart continued to sink slowly  father fauchelevent rattled in the throat  and shrieked i am strangling  my ribs are breaking  a screw  something  ah madeleine glanced about him is there  then  no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man no one stirred  javert resumed i have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw  and he was that convict ah  it is crushing me  cried the old man madeleine raised his head  met javert s falcon eye still fixed upon him  looked at the motionless peasants  and smiled sadly  then  without saying a word  he fell on his knees  and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry  he was underneath the vehicle a terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued they beheld madeleine  almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight  make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together  they shouted to him  father madeleine  come out  old fauchelevent himself said to him  monsieur madeleine  go away  you see that i am fated to die  leave me  you will get yourself crushed also madeleine made no reply all the spectators were panting  the wheels had continued to sink  and it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver  the cart rose slowly  the wheels half emerged from the ruts  they heard a stifled voice crying make haste  help  it was madeleine  who had just made a final effort they rushed forwards  the devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all  the cart was raised by twenty arms  old fauchelevent was saved madeleine rose  he was pale  though dripping with perspiration  his clothes were torn and covered with mud  all wept  the old man kissed his knees and called him the good god  as for him  he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering  and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert  who was still staring at him chapter vii fauchelevent becomes a gardener in paris fauchelevent had dislocated his kneepan in his fall  father madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his workmen in the factory building itself  and which was served by two sisters of charity  on the following morning the old man found a thousand franc bank note on his night stand  with these words in father madeleine s writing  i purchase your horse and cart  the cart was broken  and the horse was dead  fauchelevent recovered  but his knee remained stiff  m  madeleine  on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest  got the good man a place as gardener in a female convent in the rue saint antoine in paris some time afterwards  m  madeleine was appointed mayor  the first time that javert beheld m  madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town  he felt the sort of shudder which a watch dog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master s clothes  from that time forth he avoided him as much as he possibly could  when the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it  and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor  he addressed him with profound respect this prosperity created at m  sur m  by father madeleine had  besides the visible signs which we have mentioned  another symptom which was none the less significant for not being visible  this never deceives when the population suffers  when work is lacking  when there is no commerce  the tax payer resists imposts through penury  he exhausts and oversteps his respite  and the state expends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection  when work is abundant  when the country is rich and happy  the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing  it may be said  that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches the cost of collecting the taxes in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three fourths in the arrondissement of m  sur m  and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by m  de villele  then minister of finance such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither  no one remembered her  fortunately  the door of m  madeleine s factory was like the face of a friend  she presented herself there  and was admitted to the women s workroom  the trade was entirely new to fantine  she could not be very skilful at it  and she therefore earned but little by her day s work  but it was sufficient  the problem was solved  she was earning her living chapter viii madame victurnien expends thirty francs on morality when fantine saw that she was making her living  she felt joyful for a moment  to live honestly by her own labor  what mercy from heaven  the taste for work had really returned to her  she bought a looking glass took pleasure in surveying in it her youth  her beautiful hair  her fine teeth  she forgot many things  she thought only of cosette and of the possible future  and was almost happy  she hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work a lingering trace of her improvident ways  as she was not able to say that she was married she took good care  as we have seen  not to mention her little girl at first  as the reader has seen  she paid the thenardiers promptly  as she only knew how to sign her name  she was obliged to write through a public letter writer she wrote often  and this was noticed  it began to be said in an undertone  in the women s workroom  that fantine wrote letters  and that she had ways about her there is no one for spying on people s actions like those who are not concerned in them  why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall  why does mr  so and so never hang his key on its nail on tuesday  why does he always take the narrow streets  why does madame always descend from her hackney coach before reaching her house  why does she send out to purchase six sheets of note paper  when she has a whole stationer s shop full of it  etc  there exist beings who  for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas  which are  moreover  of no consequence whatever to them  spend more money  waste more time take more trouble  than would be required for ten good actions  and that gratuitously  for their own pleasure  without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity  they will follow up such and such a man or woman for whole days  they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets  under alley way doors at night in cold and rain  they will bribe errand porters  they will make the drivers of hackney coaches and lackeys tipsy  buy a waiting maid  suborn a porter  why  for no reason  a pure passion for seeing  knowing and penetrating into things  a pure itch for talking  and often these secrets once known  these mysteries made public  these enigmas illuminated by the light of day  bring on catastrophies  duels failures  the ruin of families  and broken lives  to the great joy of those who have found out everything  without any interest in the matter  and by pure instinct  a sad thing certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking their conversation  the chat of the drawing room  gossip of the anteroom  is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly  they need a great amount of combustibles  and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors so fantine was watched in addition  many a one was jealous of her golden hair and of her white teeth it was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside  in the midst of the rest  to wipe away a tear  these were the moments when she was thinking of her child  perhaps  also  of the man whom she had loved breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task it was observed that she wrote twice a month at least  and that she paid the carriage on the letter  they managed to obtain the address monsieur  monsieur thenardier  inn keeper at montfermeil  the public writer  a good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets  was made to talk in the wine shop  in short  it was discovered that fantine had a child  she must be a pretty sort of a woman  an old gossip was found  who made the trip to montfermeil  talked to the thenardiers  and said on her return for my five and thirty francs i have freed my mind  i have seen the child the gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named madame victurnien  the guardian and door keeper of every one s virtue  madame victurnien was fifty six  and re enforced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age a quavering voice  a whimsical mind  this old dame had once been young astonishing fact  in her youth  in  she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap  and passed from the bernardines to the jacobins  she was dry  rough  peevish  sharp captious  almost venomous  all this in memory of her monk  whose widow she was  and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will  she was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible at the restoration she had turned bigot  and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk  she had a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras  so this madame victurnien went to montfermeil  and returned with the remark  i have seen the child all this took time  fantine had been at the factory for more than a year  when  one morning  the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifty francs from the mayor  told her that she was no longer employed in the shop  and requested her  in the mayor s name  to leave the neighborhood this was the very month when the thenardiers  after having demanded twelve francs instead of six  had just exacted fifteen francs instead of twelve fantine was overwhelmed  she could not leave the neighborhood  she was in debt for her rent and furniture  fifty francs was not sufficient to cancel this debt  she stammered a few supplicating words  the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant  besides fantine was only a moderately good workwoman  overcome with shame  even more than with despair  she quitted the shop  and returned to her room so her fault was now known to every one she no longer felt strong enough to say a word  she was advised to see the mayor  she did not dare  the mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good  and had dismissed her because he was just  she bowed before the decision chapter ix madame victurnien s success so the monk s widow was good for something but m  madeleine had heard nothing of all this  life is full of just such combinations of events  m  madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women s workroom at the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster  whom the priest had provided for him  and he had full confidence in this superintendent a truly respectable person  firm  equitable  upright full of the charity which consists in giving  but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving m  madeleine relied wholly on her  the best men are often obliged to delegate their authority  it was with this full power  and the conviction that she was doing right  that the superintendent had instituted the suit  judged  condemned  and executed fantine as regards the fifty francs  she had given them from a fund which m madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes  and for giving assistance to the workwomen  and of which she rendered no account fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood she went from house to house  no one would have her  she could not leave town  the second hand dealer  to whom she was in debt for her furniture and what furniture said to her  if you leave  i will have you arrested as a thief  the householder  whom she owed for her rent said to her  you are young and pretty  you can pay  she divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture dealer  returned to the latter three quarters of his goods  kept only necessaries  and found herself without work  without a trade  with nothing but her bed  and still about fifty francs in debt she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison  and earned twelve sous a day  her daughter cost her ten  it was at this point that she began to pay the thenardiers irregularly however  the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night  taught her the art of living in misery  back of living on little  there is the living on nothing  these are the two chambers  the first is dark  the second is black fantine learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter  how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing s worth of millet every two days  how to make a coverlet of one s petticoat  and a petticoat of one s coverlet  how to save one s candle  by taking one s meals by the light of the opposite window  no one knows all that certain feeble creatures  who have grown old in privation and honesty  can get out of a sou  it ends by being a talent  fantine acquired this sublime talent and regained a little courage at this epoch she said to a neighbor  bah  i say to myself  by only sleeping five hours  and working all the rest of the time at my sewing i shall always manage to nearly earn my bread  and  then  when one is sad  one eats less  well  sufferings  uneasiness  a little bread on one hand  trouble on the other all this will support me it would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress  she thought of having her come  but what then  make her share her own destitution  and then  she was in debt to the thenardiers how could she pay them  and the journey  how pay for that the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence  was a sainted spinster named marguerite  who was pious with a true piety  poor and charitable towards the poor  and even towards the rich  knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself marguerite  and believing in god  which is science there are many such virtuous people in this lower world  some day they will be in the world above  this life has a morrow at first  fantine had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out when she was in the street  she divined that people turned round behind her  and pointed at her  every one stared at her and no one greeted her the cold and bitter scorn of the passers by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a north wind it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns  in paris  at least  no one knows you  and this obscurity is a garment  oh  how she would have liked to betake herself to paris  impossible she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute  as she had accustomed herself to indigence  gradually she decided on her course  at the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame  and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter  it is all the same to me  she said she went and came  bearing her head well up  with a bitter smile  and was conscious that she was becoming brazen faced madame victurnien sometimes saw her passing  from her window  noticed the distress of that creature  who  thanks to her  had been put back in her proper place  and congratulated herself  the happiness of the evil minded is black excess of toil wore out fantine  and the little dry cough which troubled her increased  she sometimes said to her neighbor  marguerite  just feel how hot my hands are nevertheless  when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb  and it flowed about her like floss silk  she experienced a moment of happy coquetry chapter x result of the success she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter  the summer passed but winter came again  short days  less work  winter  no warmth no light  no noonday  the evening joining on to the morning  fogs twilight  the window is gray  it is impossible to see clearly at it  the sky is but a vent hole  the whole day is a cavern  the sun has the air of a beggar  a frightful season  winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone  her creditors harrassed her fantine earned too little  her debts had increased  the thenardiers  who were not promptly paid  wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair  and whose carriage ruined her  one day they wrote to her that her little cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather that she needed a woollen skirt  and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this  she received the letter  and crushed it in her hands all day long  that evening she went into a barber s shop at the corner of the street  and pulled out her comb  her admirable golden hair fell to her knees what splendid hair  exclaimed the barber how much will you give me for it  said she ten francs cut it off she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardiers  this petticoat made the thenardiers furious  it was the money that they wanted  they gave the petticoat to eponine  the poor lark continued to shiver fantine thought  my child is no longer cold  i have clothed her with my hair  she put on little round caps which concealed her shorn head  and in which she was still pretty dark thoughts held possession of fantine s heart when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair  she began to hate every one about her  she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine  yet  by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her  that he was the cause of her unhappiness  she came to hate him also  and most of all  when she passed the factory in working hours  when the workpeople were at the door  she affected to laugh and sing an old workwoman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said  there s a girl who will come to a bad end she took a lover  the first who offered  a man whom she did not love out of bravado and with rage in her heart  he was a miserable scamp a sort of mendicant musician  a lazy beggar  who beat her  and who abandoned her as she had taken him  in disgust she adored her child the lower she descended  the darker everything grew about her  the more radiant shone that little angel at the bottom of her heart  she said when i get rich  i will have my cosette with me  and she laughed  her cough did not leave her  and she had sweats on her back one day she received from the thenardiers a letter couched in the following terms  cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood  a miliary fever  they call it  expensive drugs are required  this is ruining us  and we can no longer pay for them  if you do not send us forty francs before the week is out  the little one will be dead she burst out laughing  and said to her old neighbor  ah  they are good  forty francs  the idea  that makes two napoleons  where do they think i am to get them  these peasants are stupid  truly nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more  then she descended the stairs and emerged  running and leaping and still laughing some one met her and said to her  what makes you so gay she replied  a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written to me  they demand forty francs of me  so much for you  you peasants as she crossed the square  she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape  upon the top of which stood a man dressed in red  who was holding forth  he was a quack dentist on his rounds who was offering to the public full sets of teeth  opiates  powders and elixirs fantine mingled in the group  and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue  which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people  the tooth puller espied the lovely  laughing girl and suddenly exclaimed  you have beautiful teeth  you girl there  who are laughing  if you want to sell me your palettes  i will give you a gold napoleon apiece for them what are my palettes  asked fantine the palettes  replied the dental professor  are the front teeth  the two upper ones how horrible  exclaimed fantine two napoleons  grumbled a toothless old woman who was present  here s a lucky girl fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her  reflect  my beauty  two napoleons they may prove of service  if your heart bids you  come this evening to the inn of the tillac d argent  you will find me there fantine returned home  she was furious  and related the occurrence to her good neighbor marguerite  can you understand such a thing  is he not an abominable man  how can they allow such people to go about the country  pull out my two front teeth  why  i should be horrible  my hair will grow again  but my teeth  ah  what a monster of a man  i should prefer to throw myself head first on the pavement from the fifth story he told me that he should be at the tillac d argent this evening and what did he offer  asked marguerite two napoleons that makes forty francs yes  said fantine  that makes forty francs she remained thoughtful  and began her work  at the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the thenardiers letter once more on the staircase on her return  she said to marguerite  who was at work beside her what is a miliary fever  do you know yes  answered the old spinster  it is a disease does it require many drugs oh  terrible drugs how does one get it it is a malady that one gets without knowing how then it attacks children children in particular do people die of it they may  said marguerite fantine left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase that evening she went out  and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the rue de paris  where the inns are situated the next morning  when marguerite entered fantine s room before daylight for they always worked together  and in this manner used only one candle for the two she found fantine seated on her bed  pale and frozen  she had not lain down  her cap had fallen on her knees her candle had burned all night  and was almost entirely consumed marguerite halted on the threshold  petrified at this tremendous wastefulness  and exclaimed lord  the candle is all burned out  something has happened then she looked at fantine  who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night jesus  said marguerite  what is the matter with you  fantine nothing  replied fantine  quite the contrary  my child will not die of that frightful malady  for lack of succor  i am content so saying  she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering on the table ah  jesus god  cried marguerite  why  it is a fortune  where did you get those louis d or i got them  replied fantine at the same time she smiled  the candle illuminated her countenance  it was a bloody smile  a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips  and she had a black hole in her mouth the two teeth had been extracted she sent the forty francs to montfermeil after all it was a ruse of the thenardiers to obtain money  cosette was not ill fantine threw her mirror out of the window  she had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a latch to fasten it  next the roof  one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor  and knocks you on the head every instant  the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny  only by bending over more and more she had no longer a bed  a rag which she called her coverlet  a mattress on the floor  and a seatless chair still remained  a little rosebush which she had  had dried up  forgotten  in one corner  in the other corner was a butter pot to hold water  which froze in winter  and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice  she had lost her shame  she lost her coquetry  a final sign  she went out  with dirty caps  whether from lack of time or from indifference  she no longer mended her linen  as the heels wore out she dragged her stockings down into her shoes  this was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles  she patched her bodice  which was old and worn out  with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement  the people to whom she was indebted made scenes  and gave her no peace she found them in the street  she found them again on her staircase  she passed many a night weeping and thinking  her eyes were very bright and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder blade  she coughed a great deal  she deeply hated father madeleine  but made no complaint  she sewed seventeen hours a day  but a contractor for the work of prisons  who made the prisoners work at a discount  suddenly made prices fall  which reduced the daily earnings of working women to nine sous  seventeen hours of toil  and nine sous a day  her creditors were more pitiless than ever  the second hand dealer who had taken back nearly all his furniture  said to her incessantly when will you pay me  you hussy  what did they want of her  good god she felt that she was being hunted  and something of the wild beast developed in her  about the same time  thenardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once  otherwise he would turn little cosette out of doors  convalescent as she was from her heavy illness  into the cold and the streets  and that she might do what she liked with herself  and die if she chose  a hundred francs  thought fantine  but in what trade can one earn a hundred sous a day come  said she  let us sell what is left the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town chapter xi christus nos liberavit what is this history of fantine  it is society purchasing a slave from whom  from misery from hunger  cold  isolation  destitution  a dolorous bargain  a soul for a morsel of bread  misery offers  society accepts the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization  but it does not  as yet  permeate it  it is said that slavery has disappeared from european civilization  this is a mistake  it still exists  but it weighs only upon the woman  and it is called prostitution it weighs upon the woman  that is to say  upon grace  weakness  beauty maternity  this is not one of the least of man s disgraces at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached  nothing is left to fantine of that which she had formerly been she has become marble in becoming mire  whoever touches her feels cold she passes  she endures you  she ignores you  she is the severe and dishonored figure  life and the social order have said their last word for her  all has happened to her that will happen to her  she has felt everything  borne everything  experienced everything  suffered everything  lost everything  mourned everything  she is resigned  with that resignation which resembles indifference  as death resembles sleep she no longer avoids anything  let all the clouds fall upon her  and all the ocean sweep over her  what matters it to her  she is a sponge that is soaked at least  she believes it to be so  but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted  and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever alas  what are all these fates  driven on pell mell  whither are they going  why are they thus he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow he is alone  his

one would say  they are idlers  they are simply men without employment  among these unemployed there are bores  the bored  dreamers and some knaves at that period a dandy was composed of a tall collar  a big cravat  a watch with trinkets  three vests of different colors  worn one on top of the other the red and blue inside  of a short waisted olive coat  with a codfish tail  a double row of silver buttons set close to each other and running up to the shoulder  and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive  ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite  but always uneven  number of lines  varying from one to eleven a limit which was never exceeded  add to this  high shoes with little irons on the heels  a tall hat with a narrow brim  hair worn in a tuft  an enormous cane  and conversation set off by puns of potier  over all spurs and a mustache  at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois and spurs the pedestrian the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with the king of spain  of bolivar against morillo  narrow brimmed hats were royalist  and were called morillos  liberals wore hats with wide brims which were called bolivars eight or ten months  then  after that which is related in the preceding pages  towards the first of january   on a snowy evening  one of these dandies  one of these unemployed  a right thinker  for he wore a morillo  and was  moreover  warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather  was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about in a ball dress  with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair  in front of the officers  cafe  this dandy was smoking  for he was decidedly fashionable each time that the woman passed in front of him  he bestowed on her together with a puff from his cigar  some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful  such as  how ugly you are will you get out of my sight you have no teeth  etc  etc  this gentleman was known as m bamatabois  the woman  a melancholy  decorated spectre which went and came through the snow  made him no reply  did not even glance at him and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence  and with a sombre regularity  which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm  like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods  the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger  and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned  he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf  and stifling his laugh  bent down  picked up a handful of snow from the pavement  and thrust it abruptly into her back between her bare shoulders  the woman uttered a roar  whirled round gave a leap like a panther  and hurled herself upon the man  burying her nails in his face  with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard room into the gutter  these insults  poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy  did  indeed  proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth  it was fantine at the noise thus produced  the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe  passers by collected  and a large and merry circle  hooting and applauding  was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman  the man struggling  his hat on the ground  the woman striking out with feet and fists  bareheaded  howling  minus hair and teeth  livid with wrath horrible suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her satin bodice  which was covered with mud  and said to her  follow me the woman raised her head  her furious voice suddenly died away  her eyes were glassy  she turned pale instead of livid  and she trembled with a quiver of terror  she had recognized javert the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape chapter xiii the solution of some questions connected with the municipal police javert thrust aside the spectators  broke the circle  and set out with long strides towards the police station  which is situated at the extremity of the square  dragging the wretched woman after him  she yielded mechanically  neither he nor she uttered a word  the cloud of spectators followed  jesting  in a paroxysm of delight  supreme misery an occasion for obscenity on arriving at the police station  which was a low room  warmed by a stove  with a glazed and grated door opening on the street  and guarded by a detachment  javert opened the door  entered with fantine  and shut the door behind him  to the great disappointment of the curious  who raised themselves on tiptoe  and craned their necks in front of the thick glass of the station house  in their effort to see  curiosity is a sort of gluttony  to see is to devour on entering  fantine fell down in a corner  motionless and mute crouching down like a terrified dog the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table  javert seated himself  drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket  and began to write this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police  the latter do what they please  punish them  as seems good to them  and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty  javert was impassive  his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever  nevertheless  he was seriously and deeply preoccupied  it was one of those moments when he was exercising without control  but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience  his redoubtable discretionary power  at that moment he was conscious that his police agent s stool was a tribunal  he was entering judgment  he judged and condemned  he summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind  around the great thing which he was doing the more he examined the deed of this woman  the more shocked he felt it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime he had just beheld  yonder  in the street  society  in the person of a freeholder and an elector  insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pales  a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen  he had seen that  he  javert  he wrote in silence when he had finished he signed the paper  folded it  and said to the sergeant of the guard  as he handed it to him  take three men and conduct this creature to jail then  turning to fantine  you are to have six months of it  the unhappy woman shuddered six months  six months of prison  she exclaimed  six months in which to earn seven sous a day  but what will become of cosette  my daughter my daughter  but i still owe the thenardiers over a hundred francs  do you know that  monsieur inspector she dragged herself across the damp floor  among the muddy boots of all those men  without rising  with clasped hands  and taking great strides on her knees monsieur javert  said she  i beseech your mercy  i assure you that i was not in the wrong  if you had seen the beginning  you would have seen  i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame  that gentleman  the bourgeois  whom i do not know  put snow in my back  has any one the right to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably  and doing no harm to any one  i am rather ill  as you see and then  he had been saying impertinent things to me for a long time you are ugly  you have no teeth  i know well that i have no longer those teeth  i did nothing  i said to myself  the gentleman is amusing himself  i was honest with him  i did not speak to him  it was at that moment that he put the snow down my back  monsieur javert  good monsieur inspector  is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true  perhaps i did wrong to get angry  you know that one is not master of one s self at the first moment  one gives way to vivacity  and then  when some one puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it  i did wrong to spoil that gentleman s hat  why did he go away  i would ask his pardon  oh  my god it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon  do me the favor to day  for this once  monsieur javert  hold  you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sous a day  it is not the government s fault  but seven sous is one s earnings  and just fancy  i must pay one hundred francs  or my little girl will be sent to me  oh  my god i cannot have her with me  what i do is so vile  oh  my cosette  oh  my little angel of the holy virgin  what will become of her  poor creature i will tell you  it is the thenardiers  inn keepers  peasants  and such people are unreasonable  they want money  don t put me in prison  you see  there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may  in the very heart of the winter  and you must have pity on such a being  my good monsieur javert  if she were older she might earn her living  but it cannot be done at that age  i am not a bad woman at bottom  it is not cowardliness and gluttony that have made me what i am  if i have drunk brandy  it was out of misery  i do not love it  but it benumbs the senses  when i was happy  it was only necessary to glance into my closets  and it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and untidy woman  i had linen  a great deal of linen  have pity on me  monsieur javert she spoke thus  rent in twain  shaken with sobs  blinded with tears her neck bare  wringing her hands  and coughing with a dry  short cough stammering softly with a voice of agony  great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray  which transfigures the unhappy  at that moment fantine had become beautiful once more  from time to time she paused  and tenderly kissed the police agent s coat  she would have softened a heart of granite  but a heart of wood cannot be softened come  said javert  i have heard you out  have you entirely finished you will get six months  now march  the eternal father in person could do nothing more at these solemn words  the eternal father in person could do nothing more  she understood that her fate was sealed  she sank down murmuring  mercy javert turned his back the soldiers seized her by the arms a few moments earlier a man had entered  but no one had paid any heed to him  he shut the door  leaned his back against it  and listened to fantine s despairing supplications at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman  who would not rise  he emerged from the shadow  and said one moment  if you please javert raised his eyes and recognized m  madeleine  he removed his hat and  saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness excuse me  mr  mayor the words mr  mayor  produced a curious effect upon fantine  she rose to her feet with one bound  like a spectre springing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms  walked straight up to m madeleine before any one could prevent her  and gazing intently at him with a bewildered air  she cried ah  so it is you who are m  le maire then she burst into a laugh  and spit in his face m  madeleine wiped his face  and said inspector javert  set this woman at liberty javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad  he experienced at that moment  blow upon blow and almost simultaneously  the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life  to see a woman of the town spit in the mayor s face was a thing so monstrous that  in his most daring flights of fancy  he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible  on the other hand  at the very bottom of his thought  he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was  and as to what this mayor might be  and then he  with horror  caught a glimpse of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack  but when he beheld that mayor  that magistrate  calmly wipe his face and say  set this woman at liberty  he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement  thought and word failed him equally  the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case  he remained mute the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantine  she raised her bare arm  and clung to the damper of the stove  like a person who is reeling  nevertheless  she glanced about her  and began to speak in a low voice  as though talking to herself at liberty  i am to be allowed to go  i am not to go to prison for six months  who said that  it is not possible that any one could have said that  i did not hear aright  it cannot have been that monster of a mayor  was it you  my good monsieur javert  who said that i was to be set free  oh  see here  i will tell you about it  and you will let me go  that monster of a mayor  that old blackguard of a mayor  is the cause of all  just imagine  monsieur javert  he turned me out  all because of a pack of rascally women  who gossip in the workroom  if that is not a horror  what is  to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly  then i could no longer earn enough  and all this misery followed  in the first place  there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make  and that is  to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people  i will explain it to you  you see  you are earning twelve sous at shirt making  the price falls to nine sous  and it is not enough to live on  then one has to become whatever one can  as for me  i had my little cosette  and i was actually forced to become a bad woman  now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief  after that i stamped on that gentleman s hat in front of the officers  cafe  but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow  we women have but one silk dress for evening wear  you see that i did not do wrong deliberately truly  monsieur javert  and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i and who are much happier  o monsieur javert  it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free  was it not  make inquiries  speak to my landlord  i am paying my rent now  they will tell you that i am perfectly honest  ah  my god  i beg your pardon  i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove  and it has made it smoke m  madeleine listened to her with profound attention  while she was speaking  he fumbled in his waistcoat  drew out his purse and opened it  it was empty  he put it back in his pocket  he said to fantine  how much did you say that you owed fantine  who was looking at javert only  turned towards him was i speaking to you then  addressing the soldiers say  you fellows  did you see how i spit in his face  ah  you old wretch of a mayor  you came here to frighten me  but i m not afraid of you  i am afraid of monsieur javert  i am afraid of my good monsieur javert so saying  she turned to the inspector again and yet  you see  mr  inspector  it is necessary to be just  i understand that you are just  mr  inspector  in fact  it is perfectly simple  a man amuses himself by putting snow down a woman s back  and that makes the officers laugh  one must divert themselves in some way and we well  we are here for them to amuse themselves with  of course and then  you  you come  you are certainly obliged to preserve order you lead off the woman who is in the wrong  but on reflection  since you are a good man  you say that i am to be set at liberty  it is for the sake of the little one  for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child  only  don t do it again  you hussy  oh  i won t do it again  monsieur javert  they may do whatever they please to me now  i will not stir  but to day  you see  i cried because it hurt me i was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all  and then as i told you  i am not well  i have a cough  i seem to have a burning ball in my stomach  and the doctor tells me  take care of yourself  here feel  give me your hand  don t be afraid it is here she no longer wept  her voice was caressing  she placed javert s coarse hand on her delicate  white throat and looked smilingly at him all at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments  dropped the folds of her skirt  which had been pushed up as she dragged herself along  almost to the height of her knee  and stepped towards the door saying to the soldiers in a low voice  and with a friendly nod children  monsieur l inspecteur has said that i am to be released  and i am going she laid her hand on the latch of the door  one step more and she would be in the street javert up to that moment had remained erect  motionless  with his eyes fixed on the ground  cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere the sound of the latch roused him  he raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority  an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level  ferocious in the wild beast  atrocious in the man of no estate sergeant  he cried  don t you see that that jade is walking off  who bade you let her go i  said madeleine fantine trembled at the sound of javert s voice  and let go of the latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen  at the sound of madeleine s voice she turned around  and from that moment forth she uttered no word  nor dared so much as to breathe freely  but her glance strayed from madeleine to javert  and from javert to madeleine in turn according to which was speaking it was evident that javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apostrophize the sergeant as he had done  after the mayor s suggestion that fantine should be set at liberty  had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor s presence had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority  should have given such an order  and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another  without intending it  or  in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours  did he say to himself  that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions  that it was indispensable that the small should be made great  that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate  that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice  and that  in this prodigious extremity  order  law  morality  government society in its entirety  was personified in him  javert however that may be  when m  madeleine uttered that word  i  as we have just heard  police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor  pale  cold  with blue lips  and a look of despair  his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence  and say to him  with downcast eyes but a firm voice mr  mayor  that cannot be why not  said m  madeleine this miserable woman has insulted a citizen inspector javert  replied the mayor  in a calm and conciliating tone listen  you are an honest man  and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you  here is the true state of the case  i was passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away  there were still groups of people standing about  and i made inquiries and learned everything  it was the townsman who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police javert retorted this wretch has just insulted monsieur le maire that concerns me  said m  madeleine  my own insult belongs to me  i think  i can do what i please about it i beg monsieur le maire s pardon  the insult is not to him but to the law inspector javert  replied m  madeleine  the highest law is conscience  i have heard this woman  i know what i am doing and i  mr  mayor  do not know what i see then content yourself with obeying i am obeying my duty  my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison m  madeleine replied gently heed this well  she will not serve a single day at this decisive word  javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say  but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful i am sorry to oppose monsieur le maire  it is for the first time in my life  but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority  i confine myself  since monsieur le maire desires it  to the question of the gentleman  i was present  this woman flung herself on monsieur bamatabnois  who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony  which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cut stone  such things as there are in the world  in any case  monsieur le maire  this is a question of police regulations in the streets  and concerns me  and i shall detain this woman fantine then m  madeleine folded his arms  and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto the matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police  according to the terms of articles nine  eleven  fifteen  and sixty six of the code of criminal examination  i am the judge  i order that this woman shall be set at liberty javert ventured to make a final effort but  mr  mayor i refer you to article eighty one of the law of the th of december  in regard to arbitrary detention monsieur le maire  permit me not another word but leave the room  said m  madeleine javert received the blow erect  full in the face  in his breast  like a russian soldier  he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room fantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed nevertheless  she also was the prey to a strange confusion  she had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers  she had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty  her life  her soul her child  in combat before her very eyes  one of these men was drawing her towards darkness  the other was leading her back towards the light in this conflict  viewed through the exaggerations of terror  these two men had appeared to her like two giants  the one spoke like her demon the other like her good angel  the angel had conquered the demon  and strange to say  that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel  this liberator  was the very man whom she abhorred  that mayor whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes  that madeleine  and at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion  he had saved her  had she  then  been mistaken  must she change her whole soul  she did not know  she trembled  she listened in bewilderment  she looked on in affright  and at every word uttered by m  madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her  and something warm and ineffable indescribable  which was both joy  confidence and love  dawn in her heart when javert had taken his departure  m  madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice  like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking i have heard you  i knew nothing about what you have mentioned  i believe that it is true  and i feel that it is true  i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop  why did you not apply to me  but here  i will pay your debts  i will send for your child  or you shall go to her  you shall live here  in paris  or where you please  i undertake the care of your child and yourself  you shall not work any longer if you do not like  i will give all the money you require  you shall be honest and happy once more  and listen  i declare to you that if all is as you say and i do not doubt it you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of god  oh  poor woman this was more than fantine could bear  to have cosette  to leave this life of infamy  to live free  rich  happy  respectable with cosette  to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery  she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her  and could only give vent to two or three sobs  oh  oh  oh her limbs gave way beneath her  she knelt in front of m  madeleine  and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it then she fainted book sixth javert chapter i the beginning of repose m  madeleine had fantine removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house  he confided her to the sisters  who put her to bed  a burning fever had come on  she passed a part of the night in delirium and raving  at length  however  she fell asleep on the morrow  towards midday  fantine awoke  she heard some one breathing close to her bed  she drew aside the curtain and saw m madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head  his gaze was full of pity  anguish  and supplication  she followed its direction  and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall thenceforth  m  madeleine was transfigured in fantine s eyes  he seemed to her to be clothed in light  he was absorbed in a sort of prayer  she gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him  at last she said timidly what are you doing m  madeleine had been there for an hour  he had been waiting for fantine to awake  he took her hand  felt of her pulse  and replied how do you feel well  i have slept  she replied  i think that i am better  it is nothing he answered  responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it i was praying to the martyr there on high and he added in his own mind  for the martyr here below m  madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries he knew all now  he knew fantine s history in all its heart rending details  he went on you have suffered much  poor mother  oh  do not complain  you now have the dowry of the elect  it is thus that men are transformed into angels it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise you see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven  it was necessary to begin there he sighed deeply  but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking that same night  javert wrote a letter  the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m  sur m  it was addressed to paris  and the superscription ran  to monsieur chabouillet  secretary of monsieur le prefet of police  as the affair in the station house had been bruited about  the post mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off  and who recognized javert s handwriting on the cover  thought that he was sending in his resignation m  madeleine made haste to write to the thenardiers  fantine owed them one hundred and twenty francs  he sent them three hundred francs telling them to pay themselves from that sum  and to fetch the child instantly to m  sur m  where her sick mother required her presence this dazzled thenardier  the devil  said the man to his wife  don t let s allow the child to go  this lark is going to turn into a milch cow  i see through it  some ninny has taken a fancy to the mother he replied with a very well drawn up bill for five hundred and some odd francs  in this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs one for the doctor  the other for the apothecary who had attended and physicked eponine and azelma through two long illnesses  cosette  as we have already said  had not been ill  it was only a question of a trifling substitution of names  at the foot of the memorandum thenardier wrote  received on account  three hundred francs m  madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more  and wrote make haste to bring cosette christi  said thenardier  let s not give up the child in the meantime  fantine did not recover  she still remained in the infirmary the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman  with repugnance  those who have seen the bas reliefs of rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins  the ancient scorn of the vestals for the ambubajae is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity  the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion  but in a few days fantine disarmed them  she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness  one day the sisters heard her say amid her fever  i have been a sinner  but when i have my child beside me  it will be a sign that god has pardoned me  while i was leading a bad life  i should not have liked to have my cosette with me i could not have borne her sad  astonished eyes  it was for her sake that i did evil  and that is why god pardons me  i shall feel the benediction of the good god when cosette is here  i shall gaze at her it will do me good to see that innocent creature  she knows nothing at all  she is an angel  you see  my sisters  at that age the wings have not fallen off m  madeleine went to see her twice a day  and each time she asked him shall i see my cosette soon he answered to morrow  perhaps  she may arrive at any moment  i am expecting her and the mother s pale face grew radiant oh  she said  how happy i am going to be we have just said that she did not recover her health  on the contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week  that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration  as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last  at that time people were beginning to follow the fine laennec s fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies  the doctor sounded fantine s chest and shook his head m  madeleine said to the doctor well has she not a child which she desires to see  said the doctor yes well  make haste and get it here m  madeleine shuddered fantine inquired what did the doctor say m  madeleine forced himself to smile he said that your child was to be brought speedily  that that would restore your health oh  she rejoined  he is right  but what do those thenardiers mean by keeping my cosette from me  oh  she is coming  at last i behold happiness close beside me in the meantime thenardier did not let go of the child  and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it  cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter  and then  there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood  and they were collecting the bills for them  etc  etc i shall send some one to fetch cosette  said father madeleine  if necessary  i will go myself he wrote the following letter to fantine s dictation  and made her sign it  monsieur thenardier           you will deliver cosette to this person           you will be paid for all the little things           i have the honor to salute you with respect                                                   fantine in the meantime a serious incident occurred  carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made  the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it chapter ii how jean may become champ one morning m  madeleine was in his study  occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor s office  in case he should decide to take the trip to montfermeil  when he was informed that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name  javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police station  and m  madeleine had not seen him admit him  he said javert entered m  madeleine had retained his seat near the fire  pen in hand  his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating  and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations  he did not disturb himself on javert s account  he could not help thinking of poor fantine  and it suited him to be glacial in his manner javert bestowed a respectful salute on the mayor  whose back was turned to him  the mayor did not look at him  but went on annotating this docket javert advanced two or three paces into the study  and halted  without breaking the silence if any physiognomist who had been familiar with javert  and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman  the spartan  the monk  and the corporal  this spy who was incapable of a lie  this unspotted police agent if any physiognomist had known his secret and long cherished aversion for m  madeleine  his conflict with the mayor on the subject of fantine  and had examined javert at that moment  he would have said to himself  what has taken place  it was evident to any one acquainted with that clear  upright  sincere  honest  austere  and ferocious conscience  that javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle  javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance  like violent people in general  he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion  his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling  on entering he bowed to m  madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor  anger  nor distrust  he halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor s arm chair  and there he stood  perfectly erect in an attitude almost of discipline  with the cold  ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient  he waited without uttering a word  without making a movement  in genuine humility and tranquil resignation  calm  serious  hat in hand  with eyes cast down  and an expression which was half way between that of a soldier in the presence of his officer and a criminal in the presence of his judge  until it should please the mayor to turn round  all the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared  that face  as impenetrable and simple as granite  no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression  his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round well  what is it  what is the matter  javert javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity  which did not however  preclude simplicity this is the matter  mr  mayor  a culpable act has been committed what act an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect  and in the gravest manner  towards a magistrate  i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge  as it is my duty to do who is the agent  asked m  madeleine i  said javert you i and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent you  mr  mayor m  madeleine sat erect in his arm chair  javert went on  with a severe air and his eyes still cast down mr  mayor  i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me m  madeleine opened his mouth in amazement  javert interrupted him you will say that i might have handed in my resignation  but that does not suffice  handing in one s resignation is honorable  i have failed in my duty  i ought to be punished  i must be turned out and after a pause he added mr  mayor  you were severe with me the other day  and unjustly  be so to day  with justice come  now  why  exclaimed m  madeleine  what nonsense is this what is the meaning of this  what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me  what have you done to me  what are your wrongs with regard to me  you accuse yourself  you wish to be superseded turned out  said javert turned out  so it be  then  that is well  i do not understand you shall understand  mr  mayor javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest  and resumed  still coldly and sadly mr  mayor  six weeks ago  in consequence of the scene over that woman i was furious  and i informed against you informed against me at the prefecture of police in paris m  madeleine  who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than javert himself  burst out laughing now as a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police as an ex convict the mayor turned livid javert  who had not raised his eyes  went on i thought it was so  i had had an idea for a long time  a resemblance inquiries which you had caused to be made at faverolles  the strength of your loins  the adventure with old fauchelevant  your skill in marksmanship  your leg  which you drag a little i hardly know what all absurdities  but  at all events  i took you for a certain jean valjean a certain what did you say the name was jean valjean  he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago  when i was adjutant guard of convicts at toulon  on leaving the galleys  this jean valjean  as it appears  robbed a bishop  then he committed another theft  accompanied with violence  on a public highway on the person of a little savoyard  he disappeared eight years ago  no one knows how  and he has been sought  i fancied  in short  i did this thing  wrath impelled me  i denounced you at the prefecture m  madeleine  who had taken up the docket again several moments before this  resumed with an air of perfect indifference and what reply did you receive that i was mad well well  they were right it is lucky that you recognize the fact i am forced to do so  since the real jean valjean has been found the sheet of paper which m  madeleine was holding dropped from his hand  he raised his head  gazed fixedly at javert  and said with his indescribable accent ah javert continued this is the way it is  mr  mayor  it seems that there was in the neighborhood near ailly le haut clocher an old fellow who was called father champmathieu  he was a very wretched creature  no one paid any attention to him  no one knows what such people subsist on  lately  last autumn  father champmathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from well  no matter  a theft had been committed  a wall scaled branches of trees broken  my champmathieu was arrested  he still had the branch of apple tree in his hand  the scamp is locked up  up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor  but here is where providence intervened the jail being in a bad condition  the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer champmathieu to arras  where the departmental prison is situated  in this prison at arras there is an ex convict named brevet  who is detained for i know not what  and who has been appointed turnkey of the house  because of good behavior  mr  mayor  no sooner had champmathieu arrived than brevet exclaims  eh  why  i know that man he is a fagot  take a good look at me  my good man  you are jean valjean  jean valjean  who s jean valjean  champmathieu feigns astonishment  don t play the innocent dodge  says brevet  you are jean valjean  you have been in the galleys of toulon  it was twenty years ago  we were there together  champmathieu denies it  parbleu  you understand  the case is investigated  the thing was well ventilated for me  this is what they discovered  this champmathieu had been  thirty years ago  a pruner of trees in various localities  notably at faverolles  there all trace of him was lost  a long time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne  then in paris  where he is said to have been a wheelwright  and to have had a daughter  who was a laundress  but that has not been proved  now  before going to the galleys for theft  what was jean valjean  a pruner of trees  where  at faverolles  another fact this valjean s christian name was jean  and his mother s surname was mathieu  what more natural to suppose than that  on emerging from the galleys  he should have taken his mother s name for the purpose of concealing himself  and have called himself jean mathieu  he goes to auvergne  the local pronunciation turns jean into chan he is called chan mathieu  our man offers no opposition  and behold him transformed into champmathieu  you follow me  do you not  inquiries were made at faverolles  the family of jean valjean is no longer there  it is not known where they have gone  you know that among those classes a family often disappears  search was made  and nothing was found  when such people are not mud  they are dust  and then  as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back  there is no longer any one at faverolles who knew jean valjean  inquiries were made at toulon  besides brevet there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean they are cochepaille and chenildieu  and are sentenced for life they are taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended champmathieu  they do not hesitate  he is jean valjean for them as well as for brevet  the same age he is fifty four the same height  the same air  the same man  in short  it is he  it was precisely at this moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris  i was told that i had lost my reason  and that jean valjean is at arras in the power of the authorities  you can imagine whether this surprised me  when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here  i write to the examining judge  he sends for me  champmathieu is conducted to me well  interposed m  madeleine javert replied  his face incorruptible  and as melancholy as ever mr  mayor  the truth is the truth  i am sorry  but that man is jean valjean  i recognized him also m  madeleine resumed in  a very low voice you are sure javert began to laugh  with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction o  sure he stood there thoughtfully for a moment  mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table  and he added and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean  i do not see how i could have thought otherwise  i beg your pardon  mr  mayor javert  as he addressed these grave and supplicating words to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station house  and bade him leave the room javert  that haughty man was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity m  madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question and what does this man say ah  indeed  mr  mayor  it s a bad business  if he is jean valjean  he has his previous conviction against him  to climb a wall  to break a branch  to purloin apples  is a mischievous trick in a child  for a man it is a misdemeanor  for a convict it is a crime  robbing and housebreaking it is all there  it is no longer a question of correctional police  it is a matter for the court of assizes  it is no longer a matter of a few days in prison  it is the galleys for life  and then  there is the affair with the little savoyard  who will return  i hope  the deuce  there is plenty to dispute in the matter  is there not yes  for any one but jean valjean  but jean valjean is a sly dog  that is the way i recognized him  any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him  he would struggle  he would cry out the kettle sings before the fire  he would not be jean valjean  et cetera  but he has not the appearance of understanding  he says  i am champmathieu  and i won t depart from that  he has an astonished air he pretends to be stupid  it is far better  oh  the rogue is clever  but it makes no difference  the proofs are there  he has been recognized by four persons  the old scamp will be condemned  the case has been taken to the assizes at arras  i shall go there to give my testimony  i have been summoned m  madeleine had turned to his desk again  and taken up his docket  and was turning over the leaves tranquilly  reading and writing by turns like a busy man  he turned to javert that will do  javert  in truth  all these details interest me but little  we are wasting our time  and we have pressing business on hand javert  you will betake yourself at once to the house of the woman buseaupied  who sells herbs at the corner of the rue saint saulve  you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre chesnelong  the man is a brute  who came near crushing this woman and her child  he must be punished  you will then go to m  charcellay rue montre de champigny  he complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rain water on his premises  and is undermining the foundations of his house  after that  you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the rue guibourg  at widow doris s  and rue du garraud blanc  at madame renee le bosse s  and you will prepare documents  but i am giving you a great deal of work  are you not to be absent  did you not tell me that you were going to arras on that matter in a week or ten days sooner than that  mr  mayor on what day  then why  i thought that i had said to monsieur le maire that the case was to be tried to morrow  and that i am to set out by diligence to night m  madeleine made an imperceptible movement and how long will the case last one day  at the most  the judgment will be pronounced to morrow evening at latest  but i shall not wait for the sentence  which is certain  i shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken that is well  said m  madeleine and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand javert did not withdraw excuse me  mr  mayor  said he what is it now  demanded m  madeleine mr  mayor  there is still something of which i must remind you what is it that i must be dismissed m  madeleine rose javert  you are a man of honor  and i esteem you  you exaggerate your fault  moreover  this is an offence which concerns me  javert  you deserve promotion instead of degradation  i wish you to retain your post javert gazed at m  madeleine with his candid eyes  in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible  and said in a tranquil voice mr  mayor  i cannot grant you that i repeat  replied m  madeleine  that the matter concerns me but javert  heeding his own thought only  continued so far as exaggeration is concerned  i am not exaggerating  this is the way i reason  i have suspected you unjustly  that is nothing  it is our right to cherish suspicion  although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse  but without proofs  in a fit of rage  with the object of wreaking my vengeance  i have denounced you as a convict  you  a respectable man  a mayor  a magistrate  that is serious  very serious  i have insulted authority in your person  i  an agent of the authorities if one of my subordinates had done what i have done  i should have declared him unworthy of the service  and have expelled him  well  stop mr  mayor  one word more  i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others  that is just  i have done well  now  if i were not severe towards myself  all the justice that i have done would become injustice  ought i to spare myself more than others  no  what  i should be good for nothing but to chastise others  and not myself  why  i should be a blackguard  those who say  that blackguard of a javert would be in the right  mr  mayor  i do not desire that you should treat me kindly  your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others  i want none of it for myself  the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen  the police agent against the mayor  the man who is down against the man who is up in the world  is what i call false kindness  that is the sort of kindness which disorganizes society  good god  it is very easy to be kind  the difficulty lies in being just  come  if you had been what i thought you  i should not have been kind to you  not i  you would have seen  mr  mayor  i must treat myself as i would treat any other man when i have subdued malefactors  when i have proceeded with vigor against rascals  i have often said to myself  if you flinch  if i ever catch you in fault  you may rest at your ease  i have flinched  i have caught myself in a fault  so much the worse  come  discharged cashiered  expelled  that is well  i have arms  i will till the soil  it makes no difference to me  mr  mayor  the good of the service demands an example  i simply require the discharge of inspector javert all this was uttered in a proud  humble  despairing  yet convinced tone which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular  honest man we shall see  said m  madeleine and he offered him his hand javert recoiled  and said in a wild voice excuse me  mr  mayor  but this must not be  a mayor does not offer his hand to a police spy he added between his teeth a police spy  yes  from the moment when i have misused the police  i am no more than a police spy then he bowed profoundly  and directed his steps towards the door there he wheeled round  and with eyes still downcast mr  mayor  he said  i shall continue to serve until i am superseded he withdrew  m  madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm sure step  which died away on the pavement of the corridor book seventh the champmathieu affair chapter i sister simplice the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at m  sur m  but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details  among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances  which we preserve out of respect for the truth on the afternoon following the visit of javert  m  madeleine went to see fantine according to his wont before entering fantine s room  he had sister simplice summoned the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazariste ladies  like all sisters of charity  bore the names of sister perpetue and sister simplice sister perpetue was an ordinary villager  a sister of charity in a coarse style  who had entered the service of god as one enters any other service  she was a nun as other women are cooks  this type is not so very rare  the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware  which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline these rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion  the transition from a drover to a carmelite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort  the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk  a little more amplitude in the smock  and it becomes a frock  sister perpetue was a robust nun from marines near pontoise  who chattered her patois droned  grumbled  sugared the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid  treated her patients abruptly  roughly  was crabbed with the dying  almost flung god in their faces  stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rage  was bold  honest  and ruddy sister simplice was white  with a waxen pallor  beside sister perpetue she was the taper beside the candle  vincent de paul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words  in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude  they shall have for their convent only the house of the sick  for cell only a hired room  for chapel only their parish church  for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals  for enclosure only obedience  for gratings only the fear of god  for veil only modesty  this ideal was realized in the living person of sister simplice  she had never been young  and it seemed as though she would never grow old  no one could have told sister simplice s age  she was a person we dare not say a woman who was gentle  austere  well bred  cold  and who had never lied she was so gentle that she appeared fragile  but she was more solid than granite  she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine  there was  so to speak  silence in her speech  she said just what was necessary  and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing room  this delicacy accommodated itself to the serge gown  finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of god  let us emphasize one detail  never to have lied  never to have said  for any interest whatever  even in indifference  any single thing which was not the truth  the sacred truth  was sister simplice s distinctive trait  it was the accent of her virtue  she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity  the abbe sicard speaks of sister simplice in a letter to the deaf mute massieu  however pure and sincere we may be  we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little  innocent lie  she did not  little lie  innocent lie does such a thing exist  to lie is the absolute form of evil  to lie a little is not possible  he who lies  lies the whole lie  to lie is the very face of the demon satan has two names  he is called satan and lying  that is what she thought  and as she thought  so she did  the result was the whiteness which we have mentioned a whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance  her smile was white  her glance was white  there was not a single spider s web  not a grain of dust  on the glass window of that conscience  on entering the order of saint vincent de paul  she had taken the name of simplice by special choice  simplice of sicily  as we know  is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse a lie which would have saved her  this patron saint suited this soul sister simplice  on her entrance into the order  had had two faults which she had gradually corrected  she had a taste for dainties  and she liked to receive letters  she never read anything but a book of prayers printed in latin  in coarse type  she did not understand latin  but she understood the book this pious woman had conceived an affection for fantine  probably feeling a latent virtue there  and she had devoted herself almost exclusively to her care m  madeleine took sister simplice apart and recommended fantine to her in a singular tone  which the sister recalled later on on leaving the sister  he approached fantine fantine awaited m  madeleine s appearance every day as one awaits a ray of warmth and joy  she said to the sisters  i only live when monsieur le maire is here she had a great deal of fever that day  as soon as she saw m  madeleine she asked him and cosette he replied with a smile soon m  madeleine was the same as usual with fantine  only he remained an hour instead of half an hour  to fantine s great delight  he urged every one repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything  it was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him  she is losing ground fast then he returned to the town hall  and the clerk observed him attentively examining a road map of france which hung in his study  he wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil chapter ii the perspicacity of master scaufflaire from the town hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town  to a fleming named master scaufflaer  french scaufflaire  who let out horses and cabriolets as desired in order to reach this scaufflaire  the shortest way was to take the little frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which m  madeleine resided  the cure was  it was said  a worthy  respectable  and sensible man  at the moment when m  madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passer by in the street  and this person noticed this  after the mayor had passed the priest s house he halted  stood motionless  then turned about  and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage  which had an iron knocker  he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it  then he paused again and stopped short  as though in thought  and after the lapse of a few seconds  instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly  he placed it gently  and resumed his way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously m  madeleine found master scaufflaire at home  engaged in stitching a harness over master scaufflaire  he inquired  have you a good horse mr  mayor  said the fleming  all my horses are good  what do you mean by a good horse i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day the deuce  said the fleming  twenty leagues yes hitched to a cabriolet yes and how long can he rest at the end of his journey he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary to traverse the same road yes the deuce  the deuce  and it is twenty leagues m  madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures  he showed it to the fleming  the figures were    you see  he said  total  nineteen and a half  as well say twenty leagues mr  mayor  returned the fleming  i have just what you want  my little white horse you may have seen him pass occasionally  he is a small beast from lower boulonnais  he is full of fire  they wanted to make a saddle horse of him at first  bah  he reared  he kicked  he laid everybody flat on the ground  he was thought to be vicious  and no one knew what to do with him  i bought him  i harnessed him to a carriage that is what he wanted  sir  he is as gentle as a girl  he goes like the wind  ah  indeed he must not be mounted  it does not suit his ideas to be a saddle horse  every one has his ambition  draw  yes  carry  no we must suppose that is what he said to himself and he will accomplish the trip your twenty leagues all at a full trot  and in less than eight hours but here are the conditions state them in the first place  you will give him half an hour s breathing spell midway of the road  he will eat  and some one must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his oats  for i have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable men than eaten by the horses some one will be by in the second place is the cabriolet for monsieur le maire yes does monsieur le maire know how to drive yes well  monsieur le maire will travel alone and without baggage  in order not to overload the horse agreed but as monsieur le maire will have no one with him  he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen that is understood i am to have thirty francs a day  the days of rest to be paid for also not a farthing less  and the beast s food to be at monsieur le maire s expense m  madeleine drew three napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table here is the pay for two days in advance fourthly  for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy  and would fatigue the horse  monsieur le maire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own i consent to that it is light  but it has no cover that makes no difference to me has monsieur le maire reflected that we are in the middle of winter m  madeleine did not reply  the fleming resumed that it is very cold m  madeleine preserved silence master scaufflaire continued that it may rain m  madeleine raised his head and said the tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door to morrow morning at half past four o clock of course  monsieur le maire  replied scaufflaire  then  scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumb nail  he resumed with that careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness but this is what i am thinking of now  monsieur le maire has not told me where he is going  where is monsieur le maire going he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation  but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question are your horse s forelegs good  said m  madeleine yes  monsieur le maire  you must hold him in a little when going down hill  are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going do not forget to be at my door at precisely half past four o clock to morrow morning  replied m  madeleine  and he took his departure the fleming remained utterly stupid  as he himself said some time afterwards the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air monsieur scaufflaire  said he  at what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let to me the one bearing the other the one dragging the other  monsieur le maire  said the fleming  with a broad smile so be it  well does monsieur le maire wish to purchase them or me no  but i wish to guarantee you in any case  you shall give me back the sum at my return  at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet five hundred francs  monsieur le maire here it is m  madeleine laid a bank bill on the table  then left the room  and this time he did not return master scaufflaire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs  besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns the fleming called his wife  and related the affair to her  where the devil could monsieur le maire be going  they held counsel together he is going to paris  said the wife  i don t believe it  said the husband m  madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it  and it lay on the chimney piece  the fleming picked it up and studied it  five six  eight and a half  that must designate the posting relays  he turned to his wife i have found out what it is five leagues from here to hesdin  six from hesdin to saint pol eight and a half from saint pol to arras  he is going to arras meanwhile  m  madeleine had returned home  he had taken the longest way to return from master scaufflaire s  as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him  and he had wished to avoid it  he ascended to his room  and there he shut himself up  which was a very simple act since he liked to go to bed early  nevertheless  the portress of the factory  who was  at the same time  m  madeleine s only servant  noticed that the latter s light was extinguished at half past eight  and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home  adding is monsieur le maire ill  i thought he had a rather singular air this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m  madeleine s chamber  he paid no heed to the portress s words  but went to bed and to sleep  towards midnight he woke up with a start  in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head  he listened  it was a footstep pacing back and forth  as though some one were walking in the room above him  he listened more attentively  and recognized m  madeleine s step  this struck him as strange  usually  there was no noise in m  madeleine s chamber until he rose in the morning  a moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened  and then shut again  then a piece of furniture was disarranged  then a pause ensued then the step began again  the cashier sat up in bed  quite awake now and staring  and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall  from the direction of the rays  it could only come from the window of m  madeleine s chamber  the reflection wavered  as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighted than from a candle  the shadow of the window frame was not shown  which indicated that the window was wide open  the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising  the cashier fell asleep again  an hour or two later he waked again  the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead the reflection was still visible on the wall  but now it was pale and peaceful  like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle  the window was still open this is what had taken place in m  madeleine s room chapter iii a tempest in a skull the reader has  no doubt  already divined that m  madeleine is no other than jean valjean we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience  the moment has now come when we must take another look into it  we do so not without emotion and trepidation  there is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation  the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man  it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable  more complicated  more mysterious  and more infinite  there is a spectacle more grand than the sea  it is heaven  there is a spectacle more grand than heaven  it is the inmost recesses of the soul to make the poem of the human conscience  were it only with reference to a single man  were it only in connection with the basest of men  would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic  conscience is the chaos of chimeras  of lusts  and of temptations  the furnace of dreams  the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed  it is the pandemonium of sophisms  it is the battlefield of the passions  penetrate  at certain hours  past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection  and look behind  gaze into that soul  gaze into that obscurity  there  beneath that external silence  battles of giants like those recorded in homer  are in progress  skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms  as in milton  visionary circles  as in dante  what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him  and which he measures with despair against the caprices of his brain and the actions of his life alighieri one day met with a sinister looking door  before which he hesitated  here is one before us  upon whose threshold we hesitate  let us enter  nevertheless we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais  from that moment forth he was  as we have seen  a totally different man  what the bishop had wished to make of him  that he carried out  it was more than a transformation  it was a transfiguration he succeeded in disappearing  sold the bishop s silver  reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir  crept from town to town  traversed france  came to m  sur m  conceived the idea which we have mentioned accomplished what we have related  succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible  and  thenceforth  established at m  sur m  happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last  he lived in peace  reassured and hopeful  having henceforth only two thoughts to conceal his name and to sanctify his life  to escape men and to return to god these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there  both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions  in general  they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life  they turned him towards the gloom they rendered him kindly and simple  they counselled him to the same things  sometimes  however  they conflicted  in that case  as the reader will remember  the man whom all the country of m  sur m  called m madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second his security to his virtue  thus  in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence  he had preserved the bishop s candlesticks  worn mourning for him  summoned and interrogated all the little savoyards who passed that way  collected information regarding the families at faverolles  and saved old fauchelevent s life  despite the disquieting insinuations of javert  it seemed  as we have already remarked  as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise  holy  and just that his first duty was not towards himself at the same time  it must be confessed  nothing just like this had yet presented itself never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating  engaged in so serious a struggle  he understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by javert when the latter entered his study  at the moment when that name  which he had buried beneath so many layers  was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor  and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny  and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks  he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm  like a soldier at the approach of an assault  he felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head as he listened to javert  the first thought which occurred to him was to go  to run and denounce himself  to take that champmathieu out of prison and place himself there  this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh  then it passed away  and he said to himself  we will see  we will see  he repressed this first  generous instinct  and recoiled before heroism it would be beautiful  no doubt  after the bishop s holy words  after so many years of repentance and abnegation  in the midst of a penitence admirably begun  if this man had not flinched for an instant  even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture  but had continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice  at the bottom of which lay heaven  that would have been beautiful  but it was not thus  we must render an account of the things which went on in this soul  and we can only tell what there was there  he was carried away  at first  by the instinct of self preservation  he rallied all his ideas in haste stifled his emotions  took into consideration javert s presence  that great danger  postponed all decision with the firmness of terror  shook off thought as to what he had to do  and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler he remained in this state during the rest of the day  a whirlwind within  a profound tranquillity without  he took no preservative measures  as they may be called  everything was still confused  and jostling together in his brain  his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly  and he could have told nothing about himself  except that he had received a great blow he repaired to fantine s bed of suffering  as usual  and prolonged his visit  through a kindly instinct  telling himself that he must behave thus  and recommend her well to the sisters  in case he should be obliged to be absent himself  he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to arras  and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip  he said to himself that being  as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion  there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place  and he engaged the tilbury from scaufflaire in order to be prepared in any event he dined with a good deal of appetite on returning to his room  he communed with himself he examined the situation  and found it unprecedented  so unprecedented that in the midst of his revery he rose from his chair  moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety  and bolted his door  he feared lest something more should enter  he was barricading himself against possibilities a moment later he extinguished his light  it embarrassed him it seemed to him as though he might be seen by whom alas  that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience his conscience  that is to say  god nevertheless  he deluded himself at first  he had a feeling of security and of solitude  the bolt once drawn  he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished  he felt himself invisible  then he took possession of himself  he set his elbows on the table  leaned his head on his hand  and began to meditate in the dark where do i stand  am not i dreaming  what have i heard  is it really true that i have seen that javert  and that he spoke to me in that manner  who can that champmathieu be  so he resembles me  is it possible  when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil  and so far from suspecting anything  what was i doing yesterday at this hour  what is there in this incident  what will the end be  what is to be done this was the torment in which he found himself  his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas  they passed like waves  and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason  and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution his head was burning  he went to the window and threw it wide open there were no stars in the sky  he returned and seated himself at the table the first hour passed in this manner gradually  however  vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation  and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality not the whole situation  but some of the details  he began by recognizing the fact that  critical and extraordinary as was this situation  he was completely master of it this only caused an increase of his stupor independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions  all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name  that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self communion  during his sleepless nights  was to ever hear that name pronounced  he had said to himself  that that would be the end of all things for him  that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him  and who knows perhaps even his new soul within him  also  he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible  assuredly  if any one had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears  when the hideous words  jean valjean  would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him  when that formidable light  capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself  would suddenly blaze forth above his head  and that that name would not menace him  that that light would but produce an obscurity more dense  that this rent veil would but increase the mystery  that this earthquake would solidify his edifice  that this prodigious incident would have no other result  so far as he was concerned  if so it seemed good to him  than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable  and that  out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean  the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored  more peaceful  and more respected than ever if any one had told him that  he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman  well  all this was precisely what had just come to pass  all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact  and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things his revery continued to grow clearer  he came more and more to an understanding of his position it seemed to him that he had but just waked up from some inexplicable dream  and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night  erect  shivering  holding back all in vain  on the very brink of the abyss  he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger a man unknown to him  whom destiny had mistaken for him  and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead  in order that the gulf might close once more  it was necessary that some one  himself or that other man  should fall into it  he had only let things take their course the light became complete  and he acknowledged this to himself  that his place was empty in the galleys  that do what he would  it was still awaiting him  that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him  and draw him on until he filled it  that this was inevitable and fatal  and then he said to himself that  at this moment  he had a substitute  that it appeared that a certain champmathieu had that ill luck  and that  as regards himself being present in the galleys in the person of that champmathieu  present in society under the name of m  madeleine  he had nothing more to fear provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that champmathieu this stone of infamy which  like the stone of the sepulchre  falls once  never to rise again all this was so strange and so violent  that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement  which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life  a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart  which is composed of irony  of joy  and of despair  and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter he hastily relighted his candle well  what then  he said to himself  what am i afraid of  what is there in all that for me to think about  i am safe  all is over  i had but one partly open door through which my past might invade my life and behold that door is walled up forever  that javert  who has been annoying me so long  that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me  which had divined me good god  and which followed me everywhere that frightful hunting dog  always making a point at me  is thrown off the scent  engaged elsewhere  absolutely turned from the trail henceforth he is satisfied  he will leave me in peace  he has his jean valjean  who knows  it is even probable that he will wish to leave town and all this has been brought about without any aid from me  and i count for nothing in it  ah  but where is the misfortune in this  upon my honor  people would think  to see me  that some catastrophe had happened to me  after all  if it does bring harm to some one  that is not my fault in the least  it is providence which has done it all  it is because it wishes it so to be  evidently  have i the right to disarrange what it has arranged  what do i ask now  why should i meddle  it does not concern me  what  i am not satisfied  but what more do i want  the goal to which i have aspired for so many years  the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to heaven security i have now attained  it is god who wills it  i can do nothing against the will of god  and why does god will it  in order that i may continue what i have begun  that i may do good  that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example  that it may be said at last  that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone  and to that virtue to which i have returned  really  i do not understand why i was afraid  a little while ago  to enter the house of that good cure  and to ask his advice  this is evidently what he would have said to me  it is settled  let things take their course  let the good god do as he likes thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience  bending over what may be called his own abyss  he rose from his chair  and began to pace the room  come  said he  let us think no more about it  my resolve is taken  but he felt no joy quite the reverse one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore  the sailor calls it the tide  the guilty man calls it remorse  god upheaves the soul as he does the ocean after the expiration of a few moments  do what he would  he resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened  saying that which he would have preferred to ignore  and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear  yielding to that mysterious power which said to him  think  as it said to another condemned man  two thousand years ago  march on before proceeding further  and in order to make ourselves fully understood  let us insist upon one necessary observation it is certain that people do talk to themselves  there is no living being who has not done it  it may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man  and when it returns from conscience to thought  it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter  he said  he exclaimed  must be understood  one speaks to one s self  talks to one s self  exclaims to one s self without breaking the external silence  there is a great tumult  everything about us talks except the mouth  the realities of the soul are none the less realities because they are not visible and palpable so he asked himself where he stood  he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve  he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous  that to let things take their course  to let the good god do as he liked  was simply horrible  to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out  not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence  to do nothing  in short was to do everything  that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree  that it was a base  cowardly  sneaking  abject  hideous crime for the first time in eight years  the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action he spit it out with disgust he continued to question himself  he asked himself severely what he had meant by this  my object is attained  he declared to himself that his life really had an object  but what object  to conceal his name to deceive the police  was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done  had he not another and a grand object  which was the true one to save  not his person  but his soul  to become honest and good once more  to be a just man  was it not that above all  that alone which he had always desired  which the bishop had enjoined upon him to shut the door on his past  but he was not shutting it  great god  he was re opening it by committing an infamous action  he was becoming a thief once more  and the most odious of thieves  he was robbing another of his existence  his life  his peace  his place in the sunshine  he was becoming an assassin  he was murdering  morally murdering  a wretched man  he was inflicting on him that frightful living death  that death beneath the open sky  which is called the galleys  on the other hand to surrender himself to save that man  struck down with so melancholy an error  to resume his own name  to become once more  out of duty  the convict jean valjean  that was  in truth  to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that hell whence he had just emerged  to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality  this must be done  he had done nothing if he did not do all this  his whole life was useless  all his penitence was wasted  there was no longer any need of saying  what is the use  he felt that the bishop was there  that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead  that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him  that henceforth mayor madeleine  with all his virtues  would be abominable to him  and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight  that men beheld his mask  but that the bishop saw his face  that men saw his life  but that the bishop beheld his conscience  so he must go to arras  deliver the false jean valjean  and denounce the real one  alas  that was the greatest of sacrifices  the most poignant of victories  the last step to take  but it must be done  sad fate  he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men well  said he  let us decide upon this  let us do our duty  let us save this man  he uttered these words aloud  without perceiving that he was speaking aloud he took his books  verified them  and put them in order  he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen  he wrote and sealed a letter  and on the envelope it might have been read  had there been any one in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte  banker  rue d artois  paris  he drew from his secretary a pocket book which contained several bank notes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections any one who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought  would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him  only occasionally did his lips move  at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall  as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate when he had finished the letter to m  laffitte  he put it into his pocket  together with the pocket book  and began his walk once more his revery had not swerved from its course  he continued to see his duty clearly  written in luminous letters  which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance go  tell your name  denounce yourself in the same way he beheld  as though they had passed before him in visible forms  the two ideas which had  up to that time  formed the double rule of his soul the concealment of his name  the sanctification of his life  for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct  and he perceived the distance which separated them he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was  necessarily  good while the other might become bad  that the first was self devotion  and that the other was personality  that the one said  my neighbor  and that the other said  myself  that one emanated from the light  and the other from darkness they were antagonistic  he saw them in conflict  in proportion as he meditated  they grew before the eyes of his spirit  they had now attained colossal statures  and it seemed to him that he beheld within himself  in that infinity of which we were recently speaking  in the midst of the darkness and the lights  a goddess and a giant contending he was filled with terror  but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny  that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life  and that champmathieu marked the second  after the grand crisis  the grand test but the fever  allayed for an instant  gradually resumed possession of him  a thousand thoughts traversed his mind  but they continued to fortify him in his resolution one moment he said to himself that he was  perhaps  taking the matter too keenly  that  after all  this champmathieu was not interesting  and that he had actually been guilty of theft he answered himself  if this man has  indeed  stolen a few apples  that means a month in prison  it is a long way from that to the galleys  and who knows  did he steal  has it been proved  the name of jean valjean overwhelms him  and seems to dispense with proofs  do not the attorneys for the crown always proceed in this manner  he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict in another instant the thought had occurred to him that  when he denounced himself  the heroism of his deed might  perhaps  be taken into consideration  and his honest life for the last seven years  and what he had done for the district  and that they would have mercy on him but this supposition vanished very quickly  and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up  and  according to the precise terms of the law  would render him liable to penal servitude for life he turned aside from all illusions  detached himself more and more from earth  and sought strength and consolation elsewhere  he told himself that he must do his duty  that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it  that if he allowed things to take their own course  if he remained at m  sur m  his consideration  his good name  his good works  the deference and veneration paid to him  his charity  his wealth  his popularity  his virtue  would be seasoned with a crime  and what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing  while  if he accomplished his sacrifice  a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys  the post  the iron necklet  the green cap  unceasing toil and pitiless shame at length he told himself that it must be so  that his destiny was thus allotted  that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high  that  in any case  he must make his choice  virtue without and abomination within  or holiness within and infamy without the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail  but his brain grow weary  he began to think of other things  of indifferent matters  in spite of himself the veins in his temples throbbed violently  he still paced to and fro midnight sounded first from the parish church  then from the town hall he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks  and compared the sounds of the two bells  he recalled in this connection the fact that  a few days previously  he had seen in an ironmonger s shop an ancient clock for sale  upon which was written the name  antoine albin de romainville he was cold  he lighted a small fire  it did not occur to him to close the window in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor  he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck  he finally succeeded in doing this ah  yes  he said to himself  i had resolved to inform against myself and then  all of a sudden  he thought of fantine hold  said he  and what about that poor woman here a fresh crisis declared itself fantine  by appearing thus abruptly in his revery  produced the effect of an unexpected ray of light  it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect  he exclaimed ah  but i have hitherto considered no one but myself  it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself  to conceal my person or to save my soul  to be a despicable and respected magistrate  or an infamous and venerable convict  it is i  it is always i and nothing but i  but  good god  all this is egotism  these are diverse forms of egotism  but it is egotism all the same  what if i were to think a little about others  the highest holiness is to think of others  come let us examine the matter  the i  excepted  the i  effaced  the i forgotten  what would be the result of all this  what if i denounce myself  i am arrested  this champmathieu is released  i am put back in the galleys  that is well and what then  what is going on here  ah here is a country  a town  here are factories  an industry  workers both men and women  aged grandsires  children  poor people  all this i have created  all these i provide with their living  everywhere where there is a smoking chimney  it is i who have placed the brand on the hearth and meat in the pot  i have created ease  circulation  credit before me there was nothing  i have elevated  vivified  informed with life  fecundated  stimulated  enriched the whole country side  lacking me  the soul is lacking  i take myself off  everything dies  and this woman  who has suffered so much  who possesses so many merits in spite of her fall  the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been  and that child whom i meant to go in search of  whom i have promised to her mother  do i not also owe something to this woman  in reparation for the evil which i have done her  if i disappear  what happens  the mother dies  the child becomes what it can  that is what will take place  if i denounce myself  if i do not denounce myself  come  let us see how it will be if i do not denounce myself after putting this question to himself  he paused  he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation  but it did not last long  and he answered himself calmly well  this man is going to the galleys  it is true  but what the deuce he has stolen  there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft  for he has  i remain here  i go on  in ten years i shall have made ten millions  i scatter them over the country  i have nothing of my own  what is that to me  it is not for myself that i am doing it the prosperity of all goes on augmenting  industries are aroused and animated  factories and shops are multiplied  families  a hundred families  a thousand families  are happy  the district becomes populated  villages spring up where there were only farms before farms rise where there was nothing  wretchedness disappears  and with wretchedness debauchery  prostitution  theft  murder  all vices disappear  all crimes  and this poor mother rears her child  and behold a whole country rich and honest  ah  i was a fool  i was absurd what was that i was saying about denouncing myself  i really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything  what  because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous  this is melodrama  after all  because i should have thought of no one but myself  the idea  for the sake of saving from a punishment  a trifle exaggerated  perhaps but just at bottom  no one knows whom  a thief  a good for nothing evidently  a whole country side must perish  a poor woman must die in the hospital  a poor little girl must die in the street  like dogs  ah this is abominable  and without the mother even having seen her child once more  almost without the child s having known her mother  and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple thief who  most assuredly  has deserved the galleys for something else  if not for that  fine scruples  indeed  which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent  which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most  and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel and which sacrifice a whole population  mothers  wives  children  this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but me  and who is  no doubt  blue with cold at this moment in the den of those thenardiers those peoples are rascals  and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures  and i was going off to denounce myself  and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly  let us put it at the worst suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this  and that my conscience will reproach me for it some day  to accept  for the good of others  these reproaches which weigh only on myself  this evil action which compromises my soul alone  in that lies self sacrifice  in that alone there is virtue he rose and resumed his march  this time  he seemed to be content diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth  truths are found only in the depths of thought  it seemed to him  that  after having descended into these depths  after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows  he had at last found one of these diamonds one of these truths  and that he now held it in his hand  and he was dazzled as he gazed upon it yes  he thought  this is right  i am on the right road  i have the solution  i must end by holding fast to something  my resolve is taken let things take their course  let us no longer vacillate  let us no longer hang back  this is for the interest of all  not for my own  i am madeleine  and madeleine i remain  woe to the man who is jean valjean i am no longer he  i do not know that man  i no longer know anything  it turns out that some one is jean valjean at the present moment  let him look out for himself  that does not concern me  it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night  if it halts and descends on a head  so much the worse for that head he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece  and said hold  it has relieved me to come to a decision  i am quite another man now he proceeded a few paces further  then he stopped short come  he said  i must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which i have once adopted  there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean  they must be broken  in this very room there are objects which would betray me  dumb things which would bear witness against me  it is settled  all these things must disappear he fumbled in his pocket  drew out his purse  opened it  and took out a small key  he inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen  so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the wall paper  a secret receptacle opened  a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney piece  in this hiding place there were some rags a blue linen blouse  an old pair of trousers  an old knapsack  and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends  those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through d in october   could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks  in order to remind himself continually of his starting point  but he had concealed all that came from the galleys  and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen he cast a furtive glance towards the door  as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it  then  with a quick and abrupt movement  he took the whole in his arms at once  without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years  and flung them all  rags cudgel  knapsack  into the fire illustration  candlesticks into the fire  b into the fire he closed the false cupboard again  and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary  since it was now empty  he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture  which he pushed in front of it after the lapse of a few seconds  the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce  red  tremulous glow  everything was on fire the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber as the knapsack was consumed  together with the hideous rags which it contained  it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes  by bending over  one could have readily recognized a coin no doubt the forty sou piece stolen from the little savoyard he did not look at the fire  but paced back and forth with the same step all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks  which shone vaguely on the chimney piece  through the glow hold  he thought  the whole of jean valjean is still in them  they must be destroyed also he seized the two candlesticks there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment  he felt a sense of real comfort  how good warmth is  said he he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks a minute more  and they were both in the fire at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting  jean valjean  jean valjean his hair rose upright  he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing yes  that s it  finish  said the voice  complete what you are about destroy these candlesticks  annihilate this souvenir  forget the bishop forget everything  destroy this champmathieu  do  that is right  applaud yourself  so it is settled  resolved  fixed  agreed  here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him  who has  perhaps  done nothing an innocent man  whose whole misfortune lies in your name  upon whom your name weighs like a crime  who is about to be taken for you  who will be condemned  who will finish his days in abjectness and horror that is good  be an honest man yourself  remain monsieur le maire remain honorable and honored  enrich the town  nourish the indigent rear the orphan  live happy  virtuous  and admired  and  during this time  while you are here in the midst of joy and light  there will be a man who will wear your red blouse  who will bear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys  yes  it is well arranged thus  ah  wretch the perspiration streamed from his brow  he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks  but that within him which had spoken had not finished  the voice continued jean valjean  there will be around you many voices  which will make a great noise  which will talk very loud  and which will bless you  and only one which no one will hear  and which will curse you in the dark well  listen  infamous man  all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven  and only the malediction will ascend to god this voice  feeble at first  and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience  had gradually become startling and formidable  and he now heard it in his very ear  it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him  and that it was now speaking outside of him  he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly  that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror is there any one here  he demanded aloud  in utter bewilderment then he resumed  with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot how stupid i am  there can be no one there was some one  but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp  which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him  and awoke him with a start this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him it sometimes seems  on supreme occasions  as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change of place  after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn  the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal  what a fatality  what conjunction that that champmathieu should have been taken for him  to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed  at first  to strengthen his position there was a moment when he reflected on the future  denounce himself great god  deliver himself up  with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave  all that he should be obliged to take up once more  he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good  so pure  so radiant  to the respect of all  to honor  to liberty he should never more stroll in the fields  he should never more hear the birds sing in the month of may  he should never more bestow alms on the little children  he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him  he should quit that house which he had built  that little chamber  everything seemed charming to him at that moment  never again should he read those books  never more should he write on that little table of white wood  his old portress the only servant whom he kept  would never more bring him his coffee in the morning  great god  instead of that  the convict gang  the iron necklet  the red waistcoat  the chain on his ankle  fatigue  the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew so well  at his age after having been what he was  if he were only young again  but to be addressed in his old age as thou  by any one who pleased  to be searched by the convict guard  to receive the galley sergeant s cudgellings  to wear iron bound shoes on his bare feet  to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the roundsman who visits the gang  to submit to the curiosity of strangers  who would be told  that man yonder is the famous jean valjean  who was mayor of m  sur m  and at night  dripping with perspiration  overwhelmed with lassitude  their green caps drawn over their eyes  to remount  two by two  the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant s whip oh  what misery  can destiny  then  be as malicious as an intelligent being  and become as monstrous as the human heart and do what he would  he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revery  should he remain in paradise and become a demon  should he return to hell and become an angel what was to be done  great god  what was to be done the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him  his ideas began to grow confused once more  they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair  the name of romainville recurred incessantly to his mind  with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past he thought that romainville was a little grove near paris  where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly  he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone at intervals  as he combated his lassitude  he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind  he tried to put to himself  for the last time and definitely  the problem over which he had  in a manner  fallen prostrate with fatigue  ought he to denounce himself  ought he to hold his peace  he could not manage to see anything distinctly  the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished  one after the other  into smoke he only felt that  to whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die  and that of necessity  and without his being able to escape the fact  that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left  that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness  or the agony of his virtue alas  all his resolution had again taken possession of him  he was no further advanced than at the beginning thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish  eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man  the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctities and all the sufferings of humanity had also long thrust aside with his hand  while the olive trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite  the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars chapter iv forms assumed by suffering during sleep three o clock in the morning had just struck  and he had been walking thus for five hours  almost uninterruptedly  when he at length allowed himself to drop into his chair there he fell asleep and had a dream this dream  like the majority of dreams  bore no relation to the situation  except by its painful and heart rending character  but it made an impression on him  this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on  it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us  we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text of whatever nature this dream may be  the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it  it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul here it is  on the envelope we find this line inscribed  the dream i had that night i was in a plain  a vast  gloomy plain  where there was no grass  it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night i was walking with my brother  the brother of my childish years the brother of whom  i must say  i never think  and whom i now hardly remember we were conversing and we met some passers by  we were talking of a neighbor of ours in former days  who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street  as we talked we felt cold because of that open window there were no trees in the plain  we saw a man passing close to us  he was entirely nude  of the hue of ashes  and mounted on a horse which was earth color  the man had no hair  we could see his skull and the veins on it  in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a vine shoot and as heavy as iron  this horseman passed and said nothing to us my brother said to me  let us take to the hollow road there existed a hollow way wherein one saw neither a single shrub nor a spear of moss  everything was dirt colored  even the sky  after proceeding a few paces  i received no reply when i spoke  i perceived that my brother was no longer with me i entered a village which i espied  i reflected that it must be romainville  why romainville the first street that i entered was deserted  i entered a second street  behind the angle formed by the two streets  a man was standing erect against the wall  i said to this man what country is this  where am i  the man made no reply  i saw the door of a house open  and i entered the first chamber was deserted  i entered the second  behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall  i inquired of this man  whose house is this  where am i  the man replied not the house had a garden  i quitted the house and entered the garden the garden was deserted  behind the first tree i found a man standing upright  i said to this man  what garden is this  where am i  the man did not answer i strolled into the village  and perceived that it was a town  all the streets were deserted  all the doors were open  not a single living being was passing in the streets  walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens  but behind each angle of the walls  behind each door  behind each tree  stood a silent man  only one was to be seen at a time  these men watched me pass i left the town and began to ramble about the fields after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me  i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town they had strange heads  they did not seem to be in a hurry  yet they walked faster than i did  they made no noise as they walked  in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me  the faces of these men were earthen in hue then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me whither are you going  do you not know that you have been dead this long time i opened my mouth to reply  and i perceived that there was no one near me he woke  he was icy cold  a wind which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window  which had been left open on their hinges  the fire was out  the candle was nearing its end  it was still black night he rose  he went to the window  there were no stars in the sky even yet from his window the yard of the house and the street were visible  a sharp  harsh noise  which made him drop his eyes  resounded from the earth below him he perceived two red stars  whose rays lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep  hold said he  there are no stars in the sky  they are on earth now but this confusion vanished  a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly  he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage  by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle  it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse  the noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse s hoofs on the pavement what vehicle is this  he said to himself  who is coming here so early in the morning at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber he shuddered from head to foot  and cried in a terrible voice who is there some one said i  monsieur le maire he recognized the voice of the old woman who was his portress well  he replied  what is it monsieur le maire  it is just five o clock in the morning what is that to me the cabriolet is here  monsieur le maire what cabriolet the tilbury what tilbury did not monsieur le maire order a tilbury no  said he the coachman says that he has come for monsieur le maire what coachman m  scaufflaire s coachman m  scaufflaire that name sent a shudder over him  as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face ah  yes  he resumed  m  scaufflaire if the old woman could have seen him at that moment  she would have been frightened a tolerably long silence ensued  he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air  and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax  which he rolled between his fingers  the old woman waited for him she even ventured to uplift her voice once more what am i to say  monsieur le maire say that it is well  and that i am coming down chapter v hindrances the posting service from arras to m  sur m  was still operated at this period by small mail wagons of the time of the empire  these mail wagons were two wheeled cabriolets  upholstered inside with fawn colored leather  hung on springs  and having but two seats  one for the postboy the other for the traveller  the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance  and which may still be seen on the road in germany  the despatch box  an immense oblong coffer  was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it this coffer was painted black  and the cabriolet yellow these vehicles  which have no counterparts nowadays  had something distorted and hunchbacked about them  and when one saw them passing in the distance  and climbing up some road to the horizon  they resembled the insects which are called  i think  termites  and which  though with but little corselet  drag a great train behind them  but they travelled at a very rapid rate  the post wagon which set out from arras at one o clock every night  after the mail from paris had passed  arrived at m sur m  a little before five o clock in the morning that night the wagon which was descending to m  sur m  by the hesdin road  collided at the corner of a street  just as it was entering the town  with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse  which was going in the opposite direction  and in which there was but one person  a man enveloped in a mantle  the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock  the postman shouted to the man to stop  but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop that man is in a devilish hurry  said the postman the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity whither was he going  he could not have told  why was he hastening he did not know  he was driving at random  straight ahead  whither to arras  no doubt  but he might have been going elsewhere as well at times he was conscious of it  and he shuddered  he plunged into the night as into a gulf  something urged him forward  something drew him on  no one could have told what was taking place within him  every one will understand it  what man is there who has not entered  at least once in his life  into that obscure cavern of the unknown however  he had resolved on nothing  decided nothing  formed no plan done nothing  none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive he was  more than ever  as he had been at the first moment why was he going to arras he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired scaufflaire s cabriolet  that  whatever the result was to be  there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes  and judge of matters for himself  that this was even prudent  that he must know what took place  that no decision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized  that one made mountains out of everything from a distance that  at any rate  when he should have seen that champmathieu  some wretch  his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead  that javert would indeed be there and that brevet  that chenildieu  that cochepaille  old convicts who had known him  but they certainly would not recognize him bah  what an idea  that javert was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth  that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champmathieu  and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger that it was  no doubt  a dark moment  but that he should emerge from it that  after all  he held his destiny  however bad it might be  in his own hand  that he was master of it  he clung to this thought at bottom  to tell the whole truth  he would have preferred not to go to arras nevertheless  he was going thither as he meditated  he whipped up his horse  which was proceeding at that fine  regular  and even trot which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour in proportion as the cabriolet advanced  he felt something within him draw back at daybreak he was in the open country  the town of m  sur m  lay far behind him  he watched the horizon grow white  he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter s dawn as they passed before his eyes but without seeing them  the morning has its spectres as well as the evening  he did not see them  but without his being aware of it  and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical  these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway  he said to himself  and yet there are people there within who are sleeping the trot of the horse  the bells on the harness  the wheels on the road produced a gentle  monotonous noise  these things are charming when one is joyous  and lugubrious when one is sad it was broad daylight when he arrived at hesdin  he halted in front of the inn  to allow the horse a breathing spell  and to have him given some oats the horse belonged  as scaufflaire had said  to that small race of the boulonnais  which has too much head  too much belly  and not enough neck and shoulders  but which has a broad chest  a large crupper  thin  fine legs  and solid hoofs a homely  but a robust and healthy race  the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours  and had not a drop of sweat on his loins he did not get out of the tilbury  the stableman who brought the oats suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel are you going far in this condition  said the man he replied  with an air of not having roused himself from his revery why have you come from a great distance  went on the man five leagues ah why do you say  ah the man bent down once more  was silent for a moment  with his eyes fixed on the wheel  then he rose erect and said because  though this wheel has travelled five leagues  it certainly will not travel another quarter of a league he sprang out of the tilbury what is that you say  my friend i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway  just see here the wheel really had suffered serious damage  the shock administered by the mail wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub  so that the nut no longer held firm my friend  he said to the stableman  is there a wheelwright here certainly  sir do me the service to go and fetch him he is only a step from here  hey  master bourgaillard master bourgaillard  the wheelwright  was standing on his own threshold he came  examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken can you repair this wheel immediately yes  sir when can i set out again to morrow to morrow there is a long day s work on it  are you in a hurry  sir in a very great hurry  i must set out again in an hour at the latest impossible  sir i will pay whatever you ask impossible well  in two hours  then impossible to day  two new spokes and a hub must be made  monsieur will not be able to start before to morrow morning the matter cannot wait until to morrow  what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it how so you are a wheelwright certainly  sir have you not a wheel that you can sell me  then i could start again at once a spare wheel yes i have no wheel on hand that would fit your cabriolet  two wheels make a pair  two wheels cannot be put together hap hazard in that case  sell me a pair of wheels not all wheels fit all axles  sir try  nevertheless it is useless  sir  i have nothing to sell but cart wheels  we are but a poor country here have you a cabriolet that you can let me have the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle  he shrugged his shoulders you treat the cabriolets that people let you so well  if i had one  i would not let it to you well  sell it to me  then i have none what  not even a spring cart  i am not hard to please  as you see we live in a poor country  there is  in truth  added the wheelwright an old calash under the shed yonder  which belongs to a bourgeois of the town  who gave it to me to take care of  and who only uses it on the thirty sixth of the month never  that is to say  i might let that to you  for what matters it to me  but the bourgeois must not see it pass and then  it is a calash  it would require two horses i will take two post horses where is monsieur going to arras and monsieur wishes to reach there to day yes  of course by taking two post horses why not does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four o clock to morrow morning certainly not there is one thing to be said about that  you see  by taking post horses monsieur has his passport yes well  by taking post horses  monsieur cannot reach arras before to morrow  we are on a cross road  the relays are badly served  the horses are in the fields  the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required  and horses are seized upon everywhere  from the post as well as elsewhere  monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay  and  then  they drive at a walk there are many hills to ascend come then  i will go on horseback  unharness the cabriolet  some one can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood without doubt  but will this horse bear the saddle that is true  you remind me of that  he will not bear it then but i can surely hire a horse in the village a horse to travel to arras at one stretch yes that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts  you would have to buy it to begin with  because no one knows you  but you will not find one for sale nor to let  for five hundred francs  or for a thousand what am i to do the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man  and set out on your journey to morrow to morrow will be too late the deuce is there not a mail wagon which runs to arras  when will it pass to night  both the posts pass at night  the one going as well as the one coming what  it will take you a day to mend this wheel a day  and a good long one if you set two men to work if i set ten men to work what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes that could be done with the spokes  not with the hub  and the felly is in a bad state  too is there any one in this village who lets out teams no is there another wheelwright the stableman and the wheelwright replied in concert  with a toss of the head no he felt an immense joy it was evident that providence was intervening  that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road he had not yielded to this sort of first summons  he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey  he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means  he had been deterred neither by the season  nor fatigue  nor by the expense  he had nothing with which to reproach himself  if he went no further  that was no fault of his  it did not concern him further  it was no longer his fault  it was not the act of his own conscience  but the act of providence he breathed again  he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since javert s visit  it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him it seemed to him that god was for him now  and was manifesting himself he said himself that he had done all he could  and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn  it would have had no witnesses  no one would have heard him things would have rested there  and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse  but this conversation had taken place in the street  any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd  there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators  while he was questioning the wheelwright  some people who were passing back and forth halted around them  after listening for a few minutes  a young lad  to whom no one had paid any heed  detached himself from the group and ran off at the moment when the traveller  after the inward deliberation which we have just described  resolved to retrace his steps  this child returned he was accompanied by an old woman monsieur  said the woman  my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs  he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him  ready to seize him once more he answered yes  my good woman  i am in search of a cabriolet which i can hire and he hastened to add but there is none in the place certainly there is  said the old woman where  interpolated the wheelwright at my house  replied the old woman he shuddered  the fatal hand had grasped him again the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring cart the wheelwright and the stable man  in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches  interfered it was a frightful old trap  it rests flat on the axle  it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs  the rain came into it  the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture  it would not go much further than the tilbury  a regular ramshackle old stage wagon  the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it  etc  etc all this was true  but this trap  this ramshackle old vehicle  this thing  whatever it was  ran on its two wheels and could go to arras he paid what was asked  left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired  intending to reclaim it on his return  had the white horse put to the cart  climbed into it  and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning at the moment when the cart moved off  he admitted that he had felt  a moment previously  a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding  he examined this joy with a sort of wrath  and found it absurd  why should he feel joy at turning back after all  he was taking this trip of his own free will  no one was forcing him to it and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose as he left hesdin  he heard a voice shouting to him  stop  stop  he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope it was the old woman s little boy monsieur  said the latter  it was i who got the cart for you well you have not given me anything he who gave to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious ah  it s you  you scamp  said he  you shall have nothing he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed he had lost a great deal of time at hesdin  he wanted to make it good the little horse was courageous  and pulled for two  but it was the month of february  there had been rain  the roads were bad  and then it was no longer the tilbury  the cart was very heavy  and in addition there were many ascents he took nearly four hours to go from hesdin to saint pol  four hours for five leagues at saint pol he had the horse unharnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable  as he had promised scaufflaire  he stood beside the manger while the horse was eating  he thought of sad and confusing things the inn keeper s wife came to the stable does not monsieur wish to breakfast come  that is true  i even have a good appetite he followed the woman  who had a rosy  cheerful face  she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth make haste  said he  i must start again  i am in a hurry a big flemish servant maid placed his knife and fork in all haste  he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort that is what ailed me  he thought  i had not breakfasted his breakfast was served  he seized the bread  took a mouthful  and then slowly replaced it on the table  and did not touch it again a carter was eating at another table  he said to this man why is their bread so bitter here the carter was a german and did not understand him he returned to the stable and remained near the horse an hour later he had quitted saint pol and was directing his course towards tinques  which is only five leagues from arras what did he do during this journey  of what was he thinking  as in the morning  he watched the trees  the thatched roofs  the tilled fields pass by  and the way in which the landscape  broken at every turn of the road  vanished  this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul  and almost relieves it from thought  what is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time  to travel is to be born and to die at every instant  perhaps  in the vaguest region of his mind  he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence  all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us  the dark and bright intervals are intermingled  after a dazzling moment  an eclipse we look  we hasten  we stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road  and  all at once  we are old  we feel a shock  all is black  we distinguish an obscure door  the gloomy horse of life  which has been drawing us halts  and we see a veiled and unknown person unharnessing amid the shadows twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter tinques  it is true that the days were still short  he did not halt at tinques  as he emerged from the village  a laborer  who was mending the road with stones  raised his head and said to him that horse is very much fatigued the poor beast was  in fact  going at a walk are you going to arras  added the road mender yes if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early he stopped his horse  and asked the laborer how far is it from here to arras nearly seven good leagues how is that  the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter ah  returned the road mender  so you don t know that the road is under repair  you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further really you will take the road on the left  leading to carency  you will cross the river  when you reach camblin  you will turn to the right  that is the road to mont saint eloy which leads to arras but it is night  and i shall lose my way you do not belong in these parts no and  besides  it is all cross roads  stop  sir  resumed the road mender  shall i give you a piece of advice  your horse is tired return to tinques  there is a good inn there  sleep there  you can reach arras to morrow i must be there this evening that is different  but go to the inn all the same  and get an extra horse  the stable boy will guide you through the cross roads he followed the road mender s advice  retraced his steps  and  half an hour later  he passed the same spot again  but this time at full speed with a good horse to aid  a stable boy  who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the cariole still  he felt that he had lost time night had fully come they turned into the cross road  the way became frightfully bad  the cart lurched from one rut to the other  he said to the postilion keep at a trot  and you shall have a double fee in one of the jolts  the whiffle tree broke there s the whiffle tree broken  sir  said the postilion  i don t know how to harness my horse now  this road is very bad at night  if you wish to return and sleep at tinques  we could be in arras early to morrow morning he replied  have you a bit of rope and a knife yes  sir he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiffle tree of it this caused another loss of twenty minutes  but they set out again at a gallop the plain was gloomy  low hanging  black  crisp fogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke  there were whitish gleams in the clouds  a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon  as of some one moving furniture everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror  how many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night he was stiff with cold  he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of d  eight years previously  and it seemed but yesterday the hour struck from a distant tower  he asked the boy what time is it seven o clock  sir  we shall reach arras at eight  we have but three leagues still to go at that moment  he for the first time indulged in this reflection thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner  that all this trouble which he was taking was  perhaps  useless  that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial  that he should  at least have informed himself of that  that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not  then he sketched out some calculations in his mind  that  ordinarily  the sittings of the court of assizes began at nine o clock in the morning that it could not be a long affair  that the theft of the apples would be very brief  that there would then remain only a question of identity four or five depositions  and very little for the lawyers to say  that he should arrive after all was over the postilion whipped up the horses  they had crossed the river and left mont saint eloy behind them the night grew more profound chapter vi sister simplice put to the proof but at that moment fantine was joyous she had passed a very bad night  her cough was frightful  her fever had doubled in intensity  she had had dreams  in the morning  when the doctor paid his visit  she was delirious  he assumed an alarmed look and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m  madeleine arrived all the morning she was melancholy  said but little  and laid plaits in her sheets  murmuring the while  in a low voice  calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances  her eyes were hollow and staring  they seemed almost extinguished at intervals  then lighted up again and shone like stars  it seems as though  at the approach of a certain dark hour  the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth each time that sister simplice asked her how she felt  she replied invariably  well  i should like to see m  madeleine some months before this  at the moment when fantine had just lost her last modesty  her last shame  and her last joy  she was the shadow of herself  now she was the spectre of herself  physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering  this creature of five and twenty had a wrinkled brow  flabby cheeks  pinched nostrils  teeth from which the gums had receded  a leaden complexion  a bony neck  prominent shoulder blades  frail limbs  a clayey skin  and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray  alas  how illness improvises old age at mid day the physician returned  gave some directions  inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary  and shook his head m  madeleine usually came to see the invalid at three o clock  as exactness is kindness  he was exact about half past two  fantine began to be restless  in the course of twenty minutes  she asked the nun more than ten times  what time is it sister three o clock struck  at the third stroke  fantine sat up in bed  she who could  in general  hardly turn over  joined her yellow  fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp  and the nun heard her utter one of those profound sighs which seem to throw off dejection  then fantine turned and looked at the door no one entered  the door did not open she remained thus for a quarter of an hour  her eyes riveted on the door  motionless and apparently holding her breath  the sister dared not speak to her  the clock struck a quarter past three  fantine fell back on her pillow she said nothing  but began to plait the sheets once more half an hour passed  then an hour  no one came  every time the clock struck  fantine started up and looked towards the door  then fell back again her thought was clearly perceptible  but she uttered no name  she made no complaint  she blamed no one  but she coughed in a melancholy way one would have said that something dark was descending upon her  she was livid and her lips were blue  she smiled now and then five o clock struck  then the sister heard her say  very low and gently he is wrong not to come to day  since i am going away to morrow sister simplice herself was surprised at m  madeleine s delay in the meantime  fantine was staring at the tester of her bed  she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something  all at once she began to sing in a voice as feeble as a breath  the nun listened  this is what fantine was singing           lovely things we will buy            as we stroll the faubourgs through            roses are pink  corn flowers are blue            i love my love  corn flowers are blue yestere en the virgin mary came near my stove  in a broidered mantle clad  and said to me  here  hide neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me  haste to the city  buy linen  buy a needle  buy thread           lovely things we will buy            as we stroll the faubourgs through dear holy virgin  beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons decked  god may give me his loveliest star  i prefer the child thou hast granted me  madame  what shall i do with this linen fine make of it clothes for thy new born babe           roses are pink and corn flowers are blue            i love my love  and corn flowers are blue wash this linen where in the stream  make of it  soiling not  spoiling not  a petticoat fair with its bodice fine  which i will embroider and fill with flowers madame  the child is no longer here what is to be done then make of it a winding sheet in which to bury me           lovely things we will buy            as we stroll the faubourgs through            roses are pink  corn flowers are blue            i love my love  corn flowers are blue this song was an old cradle romance with which she had  in former days lulled her little cosette to sleep  and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child  she sang it in so sad a voice  and to so sweet an air  that it was enough to make any one  even a nun  weep  the sister  accustomed as she was to austerities  felt a tear spring to her eyes the clock struck six  fantine did not seem to hear it  she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her sister simplice sent a serving maid to inquire of the portress of the factory  whether the mayor had returned  and if he would not come to the infirmary soon  the girl returned in a few minutes fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts the servant informed sister simplice in a very low tone  that the mayor had set out that morning before six o clock  in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse  cold as the weather was  that he had gone alone  without even a driver  that no one knew what road he had taken that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to arras  that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris  that when he went away he had been very gentle  as usual  and that he had merely told the portress not to expect him that night while the two women were whispering together  with their backs turned to fantine s bed  the sister interrogating  the servant conjecturing fantine  with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies  which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death  had raised herself to her knees in bed  with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster  and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains  and was listening  all at once she cried you are speaking of m  madeleine  why are you talking so low  what is he doing  why does he not come her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man  they wheeled round in affright answer me  cried fantine the servant stammered the portress told me that he could not come to day be calm  my child  said the sister  lie down again fantine  without changing her attitude  continued in a loud voice  and with an accent that was both imperious and heart rending he cannot come  why not  you know the reason  you are whispering it to each other there  i want to know it the servant maid hastened to say in the nun s ear  say that he is busy with the city council sister simplice blushed faintly  for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her on the other hand  it seemed to her that the mere communication of the truth to the invalid would  without doubt  deal her a terrible blow  and that this was a serious matter in fantine s present state  her flush did not last long  the sister raised her calm  sad eyes to fantine  and said  monsieur le maire has gone away fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed  her eyes sparkled  indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face gone  she cried  he has gone to get cosette then she raised her arms to heaven  and her white face became ineffable her lips moved  she was praying in a low voice when her prayer was finished  sister  she said  i am willing to lie down again  i will do anything you wish  i was naughty just now  i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud  it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that well  my good sister  but  you see  i am very happy  the good god is good  m  madeleine is good  just think  he has gone to montfermeil to get my little cosette she lay down again  with the nun s assistance  helped the nun to arrange her pillow  and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck  and which sister simplice had given her my child  said the sister  try to rest now  and do not talk any more fantine took the sister s hand in her moist hands  and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration he set out this morning for paris  in fact  he need not even go through paris  montfermeil is a little to the left as you come thence  do you remember how he said to me yesterday  when i spoke to him of cosette soon  soon  he wants to give me a surprise  you know  he made me sign a letter so that she could be taken from the thenardiers  they cannot say anything  can they  they will give back cosette  for they have been paid  the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay  do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister  i am extremely happy  i am doing well  i am not ill at all any more  i am going to see cosette again  i am even quite hungry  it is nearly five years since i saw her last  you cannot imagine how much attached one gets to children  and then  she will be so pretty  you will see  if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had  in the first place  she will have very beautiful hands  she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old  like this  she must be a big girl now  she is seven years old  she is quite a young lady  i call her cosette  but her name is really euphrasie  stop  this morning i was looking at the dust on the chimney piece  and i had a sort of idea come across me  like that  that i should see cosette again soon  mon dieu how wrong it is not to see one s children for years  one ought to reflect that life is not eternal  oh  how good m  le maire is to go  it is very cold  it is true  he had on his cloak  at least  he will be here to morrow  will he not  to morrow will be a festival day  to morrow morning  sister  you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it  what a place that montfermeil is  i took that journey on foot once  it was very long for me  but the diligences go very quickly he will be here to morrow with cosette  how far is it from here to montfermeil the sister  who had no idea of distances  replied  oh  i think that he will be here to morrow to morrow  to morrow  said fantine  i shall see cosette to morrow you see  good sister of the good god  that i am no longer ill  i am mad i could dance if any one wished it a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the change  she was all rosy now  she spoke in a lively and natural voice  her whole face was one smile  now and then she talked she laughed softly  the joy of a mother is almost infantile well  resumed the nun  now that you are happy  mind me  and do not talk any more fantine laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice  yes lie down again  be good  for you are going to have your child  sister simplice is right  every one here is right and then  without stirring  without even moving her head  she began to stare all about her with wide open eyes and a joyous air  and she said nothing more the sister drew the curtains together again  hoping that she would fall into a doze  between seven and eight o clock the doctor came  not hearing any sound  he thought fantine was asleep  entered softly  and approached the bed on tiptoe  he opened the curtains a little  and  by the light of the taper  he saw fantine s big eyes gazing at him she said to him  she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed  will she not  sir the doctor thought that she was delirious  she added see  there is just room the doctor took sister simplice aside  and she explained matters to him that m  madeleine was absent for a day or two  and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid  who believed that the mayor had gone to montfermeil  that it was possible  after all  that her guess was correct  the doctor approved he returned to fantine s bed  and she went on you see  when she wakes up in the morning  i shall be able to say good morning to her  poor kitten  and when i cannot sleep at night  i can hear her asleep  her little gentle breathing will do me good give me your hand  said the doctor she stretched out her arm  and exclaimed with a laugh ah  hold  in truth  you did not know it  i am cured  cosette will arrive to morrow the doctor was surprised  she was better  the pressure on her chest had decreased  her pulse had regained its strength  a sort of life had suddenly supervened and reanimated this poor  worn out creature doctor  she went on  did the sister tell you that m  le maire has gone to get that mite of a child the doctor recommended silence  and that all painful emotions should be avoided  he prescribed an infusion of pure chinchona  and  in case the fever should increase again during the night  a calming potion  as he took his departure  he said to the sister she is doing better  if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive to morrow with the child  who knows  there are crises so astounding  great joy has been known to arrest maladies  i know well that this is an organic disease  and in an advanced state  but all those things are such mysteries  we may be able to save her chapter vii the traveller on his arrival takes precautions for departure it was nearly eight o clock in the evening when the cart  which we left on the road  entered the porte cochere of the hotel de la poste in arras  the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it  responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn  sent back the extra horse  and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable  then he opened the door of a billiard room which was situated on the ground floor  sat down there and leaned his elbows on a table  he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six  he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault  but at bottom  he was not sorry the landlady of the hotel entered does monsieur wish a bed  does monsieur require supper he made a sign of the head in the negative the stableman says that monsieur s horse is extremely fatigued here he broke his silence will not the horse be in a condition to set out again to morrow morning oh  monsieur  he must rest for two days at least he inquired is not the posting station located here yes  sir the hostess conducted him to the office  he showed his passport  and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night to m sur m  by the mail wagon  the seat beside the post boy chanced to be vacant  he engaged it and paid for it  monsieur  said the clerk do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely one o clock in the morning this done  he left the hotel and began to wander about the town he was not acquainted with arras  the streets were dark  and he walked on at random  but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passers by  he crossed the little river crinchon  and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way  a citizen was passing along with a lantern  after some hesitation  he decided to apply to this man  not without having first glanced behind and in front of him  as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put monsieur  said he  where is the court house  if you please you do not belong in town  sir  replied the bourgeois  who was an oldish man  well  follow me  i happen to be going in the direction of the court house  that is to say  in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture  for the court house is undergoing repairs just at this moment  and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture is it there that the assizes are held  he asked certainly  sir  you see  the prefecture of to day was the bishop s palace before the revolution  m  de conzie  who was bishop in  built a grand hall there  it is in this grand hall that the court is held on the way  the bourgeois said to him if monsieur desires to witness a case  it is rather late  the sittings generally close at six o clock when they arrived on the grand square  however  the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up  in the front of a vast and gloomy building upon my word  sir  you are in luck  you have arrived in season  do you see those four windows  that is the court of assizes  there is light there  so they are not through  the matter must have been greatly protracted  and they are holding an evening session  do you take an interest in this affair  is it a criminal case  are you a witness he replied i have not come on any business  i only wish to speak to one of the lawyers that is different  said the bourgeois  stop  sir  here is the door where the sentry stands  you have only to ascend the grand staircase he conformed to the bourgeois s directions  and a few minutes later he was in a hall containing many people  and where groups  intermingled with lawyers in their gowns  were whispering together here and there it is always a heart breaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black  murmuring together in low voices  on the threshold of the halls of justice  it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words  condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result  all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre hives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices this spacious hall  illuminated by a single lamp  was the old hall of the episcopal palace  and served as the large hall of the palace of justice  a double leaved door  which was closed at that moment separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met what stage have they reached  sir  he asked it is finished  said the lawyer finished this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round excuse me sir  perhaps you are a relative no  i know no one here  has judgment been pronounced of course  nothing else was possible to penal servitude for life he continued  in a voice so weak that it was barely audible then his identity was established what identity  replied the lawyer  there was no identity to be established  the matter was very simple  the woman had murdered her child  the infanticide was proved  the jury threw out the question of premeditation  and she was condemned for life so it was a woman  said he why  certainly  the limosin woman  of what are you speaking nothing  but since it is all over  how comes it that the hall is still lighted for another case  which was begun about two hours ago what other case oh  this one is a clear case also  it is about a sort of blackguard a man arrested for a second offence  a convict who has been guilty of theft  i don t know his name exactly  there s a bandit s phiz for you i d send him to the galleys on the strength of his face alone is there any way of getting into the court room  sir  said he i really think that there is not  there is a great crowd  however the hearing has been suspended  some people have gone out  and when the hearing is resumed  you might make an effort where is the entrance through yonder large door the lawyer left him  in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously  almost intermingled with each other  all possible emotions  the words of this indifferent spectator had  in turn  pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire  when he saw that nothing was settled  he breathed freely once more  but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying  the docket of the session was very heavy  the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases  they had begun with the infanticide  and now they had reached the convict  the old offender  the return horse  this man had stolen apples  but that did not appear to be entirely proved  what had been proved was  that he had already been in the galleys at toulon  it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case  however  the man s examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed  but the lawyer s plea  and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come  it could not be finished before midnight  the man would probably be condemned  the attorney general was very clever  and never missed his culprits  he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the assizes he inquired of this usher will the door be opened soon  sir it will not be opened at all  replied the usher what  it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed  is not the hearing suspended the hearing has just been begun again  replied the usher  but the door will not be opened again why because the hall is full what  there is not room for one more not another one  the door is closed  no one can enter now the usher added after a pause  there are  to tell the truth  two or three extra places behind monsieur le president  but monsieur le president only admits public functionaries to them so saying  the usher turned his back he retired with bowed head  traversed the antechamber  and slowly descended the stairs  as though hesitating at every step  it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself  the violent conflict which had been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended and every moment he encountered some new phase of it  on reaching the landing place  he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms  all at once he opened his coat  drew out his pocket book  took from it a pencil  tore out a leaf  and upon that leaf he wrote rapidly by the light of the street lantern  this line  m  madeleine  mayor of m sur m  then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides  made his way through the crowd  walked straight up to the usher  handed him the paper  and said in an authoritative manner take this to monsieur le president the usher took the paper  cast a glance upon it  and obeyed chapter viii an entrance by favor although he did not suspect the fact  the mayor of m  sur m  enjoyed a sort of celebrity  for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of bas boulonnais  it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments  besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m  sur m  which was not indebted to him for some benefit  he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissements  it was thus that he had  when occasion offered  supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne  the flax spinning industry at frevent  and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at boubers sur canche  everywhere the name of m  madeleine was pronounced with veneration  arras and douai envied the happy little town of m  sur m  its mayor the councillor of the royal court of douai  who was presiding over this session of the assizes at arras  was acquainted  in common with the rest of the world  with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored  when the usher  discreetly opening the door which connected the council chamber with the court room  bent over the back of the president s arm chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused  adding  the gentleman desires to be present at the trial  the president  with a quick and deferential movement  seized a pen and wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher  saying  admit him the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall  in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him  in the midst of his revery he heard some one saying to him  will monsieur do me the honor to follow me  it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously  and who was now bowing to the earth before him  at the same time  the usher handed him the paper  he unfolded it  and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it the president of the court of assizes presents his respects to m madeleine he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste he followed the usher a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscoted cabinet of severe aspect  lighted by two wax candles  placed upon a table with a green cloth  the last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears  monsieur  you are now in the council chamber  you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the court room  behind the president s chair  these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed the usher had left him alone  the supreme moment had arrived  he sought to collect his faculties  but could not  it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life  that the threads of thought snap within the brain  he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned  with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken  which was soon to ring with his name  and which his fate was at that moment traversing  he stared at the wall  then he looked at himself  wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours  he was worn out by the jolts of the cart  but he was not conscious of it  it seemed to him that he felt nothing he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall  and which contained  under glass  an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas pache  mayor of paris and minister  and dated  through an error  no doubt  the th of june  of the year ii  and in which pache forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment  and who had watched him  would have imagined  doubtless  that this letter struck him as very curious  for he did not take his eyes from it  and he read it two or three times  he read it without paying any attention to it  and unconsciously  he was thinking of fantine and cosette as he dreamed  he turned round  and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes  he had almost forgotten that door  his glance  calm at first  paused there  remained fixed on that brass handle  then grew terrified  and little by little became impregnated with fear  beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion  which is intended to convey  and which does so well convey  pardieu  who compels me to this  then he wheeled briskly round  caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him  went to it  opened it  and passed out  he was no longer in that chamber  he was outside in a corridor  a long  narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings  making all sorts of angles  lighted here and there by lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids  the corridor through which he had approached  he breathed  he listened  not a sound in front  not a sound behind him  and he fled as though pursued when he had turned many angles in this corridor  he still listened  the same silence reigned  and there was the same darkness around him  he was out of breath  he staggered  he leaned against the wall  the stone was cold  the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow  he straightened himself up with a shiver then  there alone in the darkness  trembling with cold and with something else  too  perchance  he meditated he had meditated all night long  he had meditated all the day  he heard within him but one voice  which said  alas a quarter of an hour passed thus  at length he bowed his head  sighed with agony  dropped his arms  and retraced his steps  he walked slowly and as though crushed  it seemed as though some one had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back he re entered the council chamber  the first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door  this knob  which was round and of polished brass  shone like a terrible star for him  he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger he could not take his eyes from it  from time to time he advanced a step and approached the door had he listened  he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur  but he did not listen  and he did not hear suddenly  without himself knowing how it happened  he found himself near the door  he grasped the knob convulsively  the door opened he was in the court room chapter ix a place where convictions are in process of formation he advanced a pace  closed the door mechanically behind him  and remained standing  contemplating what he saw it was a vast and badly lighted apartment  now full of uproar  now full of silence  where all the apparatus of a criminal case  with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng  was in process of development at the one end of the hall  the one where he was  were judges  with abstracted air  in threadbare robes  who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids  at the other end  a ragged crowd  lawyers in all sorts of attitudes  soldiers with hard but honest faces  ancient spotted woodwork  a dirty ceiling  tables covered with serge that was yellow rather than green  doors blackened by handmarks  tap room lamps which emitted more smoke than light  suspended from nails in the wainscot  on the tables candles in brass candlesticks  darkness ugliness  sadness  and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression  for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law  and that grand divine thing which is called justice no one in all that throng paid any attention to him  all glances were directed towards a single point  a wooden bench placed against a small door  in the stretch of wall on the president s left  on this bench illuminated by several candles  sat a man between two gendarmes this man was the man he did not seek him  he saw him  his eyes went thither naturally  as though they had known beforehand where that figure was he thought he was looking at himself  grown old  not absolutely the same in face  of course  but exactly similar in attitude and aspect  with his bristling hair  with that wild and uneasy eye  with that blouse  just as it was on the day when he entered d  full of hatred  concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison he said to himself with a shudder  good god  shall i become like that again this creature seemed to be at least sixty  there was something indescribably coarse  stupid  and frightened about him at the sound made by the opening door  people had drawn aside to make way for him  the president had turned his head  and  understanding that the personage who had just entered was the mayor of m  sur m  he had bowed to him  the attorney general  who had seen m  madeleine at m sur m  whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognized him and saluted him also  he had hardly perceived it  he was the victim of a sort of hallucination  he was watching judges  clerks  gendarmes  a throng of cruelly curious heads  all these he had already beheld once  in days gone by  twenty seven years before he had encountered those fatal things once more  there they were  they moved  they existed  it was no longer an effort of his memory  a mirage of his thought  they were real gendarmes and real judges  a real crowd  and real men of flesh and blood  it was all over  he beheld the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him with all that there is formidable in reality all this was yawning before him he was horrified by it  he shut his eyes  and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul  never and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble  and rendered him nearly mad  it was another self of his that was there  all called that man who was being tried jean valjean under his very eyes  unheard of vision  he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life  enacted by his spectre everything was there  the apparatus was the same  the hour of the night the faces of the judges  of soldiers  and of spectators  all were the same  only above the president s head there hung a crucifix  something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation  god had been absent when he had been judged there was a chair behind him  he dropped into it  terrified at the thought that he might be seen  when he was seated  he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes  which stood on the judge s desk  to conceal his face from the whole room  he could now see without being seen  he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things  gradually he recovered  he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen m  bamatabois was one of the jurors he looked for javert  but did not see him  the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk s table  and then  as we have just said the hall was sparely lighted at the moment of this entrance  the defendant s lawyer had just finished his plea the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch  the affair had lasted for three hours  for three hours that crowd had been watching a strange man  a miserable specimen of humanity  either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle  gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness  this man  as the reader already knows  was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples  broken in the orchard of a neighbor  called the pierron orchard  who was this man  an examination had been made  witnesses had been heard  and they were unanimous  light had abounded throughout the entire debate  the accusation said  we have in our grasp not only a marauder  a stealer of fruit  we have here  in our hands  a bandit  an old offender who has broken his ban  an ex convict  a miscreant of the most dangerous description  a malefactor named jean valjean  whom justice has long been in search of  and who  eight years ago  on emerging from the galleys at toulon  committed a highway robbery  accompanied by violence  on the person of a child  a savoyard named little gervais  a crime provided for by article  of the penal code  the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter  when his identity shall have been judicially established  he has just committed a fresh theft  it is a case of a second offence  condemn him for the fresh deed  later on he will be judged for the old crime  in the face of this accusation  in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses  the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else  he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey no  or else he stared at the ceiling  he spoke with difficulty replied with embarrassment  but his whole person  from head to foot  was a denial  he was an idiot in the presence of all these minds ranged in order of battle around him  and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him  nevertheless  it was a question of the most menacing future for him  the likeness increased every moment  and the entire crowd surveyed  with more anxiety than he did himself  that sentence freighted with calamity  which descended ever closer over his head  there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded  besides the galleys  a possible death penalty  in case his identity were established  and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation  who was this man  what was the nature of his apathy  was it imbecility or craft  did he understand too well  or did he not understand at all  these were questions which divided the crowd and seemed to divide the jury  there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case  the drama was not only melancholy  it was also obscure the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well  in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates  at paris as well as at romorantin or at montbrison  and which to day  having become classic  is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy  to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorousness and its majestic stride  a tongue in which a husband is called a consort  and a woman a spouse  paris  the centre of art and civilization  the king the monarch  monseigneur the bishop  a sainted pontiff  the district attorney  the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution  the arguments  the accents which we have just listened to  the age of louis xiv  the grand age  a theatre  the temple of melpomene  the reigning family  the august blood of our kings  a concert  a musical solemnity the general commandant of the province  the illustrious warrior  who etc  the pupils in the seminary  these tender levities  errors imputed to newspapers  the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs  etc  the lawyer had  accordingly  begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apples an awkward matter couched in fine style  but benigne bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration  and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion  the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantially proved his client  whom he  in his character of counsel  persisted in calling champmathieu  had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by any one  he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call a bough  in his possession  but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground  and had picked it up where was there any proof to the contrary  no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall  then thrown away by the alarmed marauder  there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case  but what proof was there that that thief had been champmathieu  one thing only  his character as an ex convict  the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be  unhappily well attested  the accused had resided at faverolles  the accused had exercised the calling of a tree pruner there  the name of champmathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu  all that was true in short  four witnesses recognize champmathieu  positively and without hesitation  as that convict  jean valjean  to these signs  to this testimony  the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client  the denial of an interested party  but supposing that he was the convict jean valjean  did that prove that he was the thief of the apples  that was a presumption at the most  not a proof  the prisoner it was true  and his counsel  in good faith  was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence  he obstinately denied everything the theft and his character of convict  an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better  and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges  the counsel had advised him to do this  but the accused had obstinately refused  thinking  no doubt  that he would save everything by admitting nothing  it was an error  but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration  this man was visibly stupid  long continued wretchedness in the galleys  long misery outside the galleys  had brutalized him  etc  he defended himself badly  was that a reason for condemning him  as for the affair with little gervais  the counsel need not discuss it  it did not enter into the case  the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court  if the identity of jean valjean appeared to them to be evident  to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his ban  and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence  he was violent and florid  as district attorneys usually are he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty  and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty  he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer  the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean  he took note of this  so this man was jean valjean  this point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed  here  by means of a clever autonomasia which went back to the sources and causes of crime  the district attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school  then dawning under the name of the satanic school  which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and the oriflamme  he attributed  not without some probability  to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of champmathieu  or rather to speak more correctly  of jean valjean  having exhausted these considerations  he passed on to jean valjean himself  who was this jean valjean  description of jean valjean  a monster spewed forth  etc the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of theramene  which is not useful to tragedy  but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence  the audience and the jury shuddered  the description finished  the district attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day  and it is such a man  etc  etc  etc  vagabond  beggar  without means of existence  etc  etc  inured by his past life to culpable deeds  and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys  as was proved by the crime committed against little gervais  etc  etc  it is such a man caught upon the highway in the very act of theft  a few paces from a wall that had been scaled  still holding in his hand the object stolen  who denies the crime  the theft  the climbing the wall  denies everything  denies even his own identity  in addition to a hundred other proofs  to which we will not recur  four witnesses recognize him javert  the upright inspector of police  javert  and three of his former companions in infamy  the convicts brevet  chenildieu  and cochepaille  what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity  his denial  what obduracy  you will do justice  gentlemen of the jury  etc  etc  while the district attorney was speaking  the accused listened to him open mouthed  with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended  he was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that  from time to time  at those energetic moments of the prosecutor s speech  when eloquence which cannot contain itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm  he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument  two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice  that is what comes of not having asked m  baloup  the district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude  evidently deliberate  which denoted not imbecility  but craft skill  a habit of deceiving justice  and which set forth in all its nakedness the profound perversity  of this man  he ended by making his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding a severe sentence at that time  as the reader will remember  it was penal servitude for life the counsel for the defence rose  began by complimenting monsieur l avocat general on his admirable speech  then replied as best he could  but he weakened  the ground was evidently slipping away from under his feet chapter x the system of denials the moment for closing the debate had arrived  the president had the accused stand up  and addressed to him the customary question  have you anything to add to your defence the man did not appear to understand  as he stood there  twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had the president repeated the question this time the man heard it  he seemed to understand  he made a motion like a man who is just waking up  cast his eyes about him  stared at the audience  the gendarmes  his counsel  the jury  the court  laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench took another look  and all at once  fixing his glance upon the district attorney  he began to speak  it was like an eruption it seemed  from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth incoherent  impetuous  pell mell  tumbling over each other as though they were all pressing forward to issue forth at once  he said this is what i have to say  that i have been a wheelwright in paris and that it was with monsieur baloup  it is a hard trade  in the wheelwright s trade one works always in the open air  in courtyards under sheds when the masters are good  never in closed workshops because space is required  you see  in winter one gets so cold that one beats one s arms together to warm one s self  but the masters don t like it  they say it wastes time  handling iron when there is ice between the paving stones is hard work  that wears a man out quickly  one is old while he is still quite young in that trade  at forty a man is done for i was fifty three  i was in a bad state  and then  workmen are so mean when a man is no longer young  they call him nothing but an old bird old beast  i was not earning more than thirty sous a day  they paid me as little as possible  the masters took advantage of my age and then i had my daughter  who was a laundress at the river  she earned a little also  it sufficed for us two  she had trouble  also  all day long up to her waist in a tub  in rain  in snow  when the wind cuts your face  when it freezes  it is all the same  you must still wash  there are people who have not much linen  and wait until late  if you do not wash  you lose your custom  the planks are badly joined  and water drops on you from everywhere  you have your petticoats all damp above and below  that penetrates  she has also worked at the laundry of the enfants rouges where the water comes through faucets  you are not in the tub there  you wash at the faucet in front of you  and rinse in a basin behind you  as it is enclosed  you are not so cold  but there is that hot steam  which is terrible  and which ruins your eyes  she came home at seven o clock in the evening  and went to bed at once  she was so tired  her husband beat her  she is dead  we have not been very happy  she was a good girl who did not go to the ball  and who was very peaceable  i remember one shrove tuesday when she went to bed at eight o clock  there  i am telling the truth  you have only to ask  ah  yes  how stupid i am  paris is a gulf  who knows father champmathieu there  but m  baloup does  i tell you  go see at m  baloup s  and after all  i don t know what is wanted of me the man ceased speaking  and remained standing  he had said these things in a loud  rapid  hoarse voice  with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness  once he paused to salute some one in the crowd  the sort of affirmations which he seemed to fling out before him at random came like hiccoughs  and to each he added the gesture of a wood cutter who is splitting wood  when he had finished  the audience burst into a laugh he stared at the public  and  perceiving that they were laughing  and not understanding why  he began to laugh himself it was inauspicious the president  an attentive and benevolent man  raised his voice he reminded the gentlemen of the jury  that the sieur baloup  formerly a master wheelwright  with whom the accused stated that he had served had been summoned in vain  he had become bankrupt  and was not to be found  then turning to the accused  he enjoined him to listen to what he was about to say  and added  you are in a position where reflection is necessary  the gravest presumptions rest upon you  and may induce vital results  prisoner  in your own interests  i summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points  in the first place did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard  break the branch  and steal the apples  that is to say  commit the crime of breaking in and theft  in the second place  are you the discharged convict  jean valjean yes or no the prisoner shook his head with a capable air  like a man who has thoroughly understood  and who knows what answer he is going to make  he opened his mouth  turned towards the president  and said in the first place then he stared at his cap  stared at the ceiling  and held his peace prisoner  said the district attorney  in a severe voice  pay attention  you are not answering anything that has been asked of you your embarrassment condemns you  it is evident that your name is not champmathieu  that you are the convict  jean valjean  concealed first under the name of jean mathieu  which was the name of his mother  that you went to auvergne  that you were born at faverolles  where you were a pruner of trees  it is evident that you have been guilty of entering and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard  the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion illustration  father champmathieu on trial the prisoner had finally resumed his seat  he arose abruptly when the district attorney had finished  and exclaimed you are very wicked  that you are  this what i wanted to say  i could not find words for it at first  i have stolen nothing  i am a man who does not have something to eat every day  i was coming from ailly  i was walking through the country after a shower  which had made the whole country yellow  even the ponds were overflowed  and nothing sprang from the sand any more but the little blades of grass at the wayside  i found a broken branch with apples on the ground  i picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble  i have been in prison  and they have been dragging me about for the last three months more than that i cannot say  people talk against me  they tell me answer  the gendarme  who is a good fellow  nudges my elbow  and says to me in a low voice  come  answer  i don t know how to explain  i have no education  i am a poor man  that is where they wrong me  because they do not see this  i have not stolen  i picked up from the ground things that were lying there  you say  jean valjean  jean mathieu  i don t know those persons  they are villagers  i worked for m  baloup boulevard de l hopital  my name is champmathieu  you are very clever to tell me where i was born  i don t know myself  it s not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world  that would be too convenient  i think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways  i know nothing different  when i was a child they called me young fellow  now they call me old fellow  those are my baptismal names  take that as you like  i have been in auvergne  i have been at faverolles  pardi  well  can t a man have been in auvergne  or at faverolles  without having been in the galleys  i tell you that i have not stolen  and that i am father champmathieu  i have been with m baloup  i have had a settled residence  you worry me with your nonsense there  why is everybody pursuing me so furiously the district attorney had remained standing  he addressed the president monsieur le president  in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prisoner  who would like to pass himself off as an idiot but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to that we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts brevet  cochepaille  and chenildieu  and police inspector javert  and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean i would remind the district attorney  said the president  that police inspector javert  recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement  left the court room and the town as soon as he had made his deposition  we have accorded him permission  with the consent of the district attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner that is true  mr  president  responded the district attorney  in the absence of sieur javert  i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago  javert is an estimable man  who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions  these are the terms of his deposition  i do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner s denial  i recognize him perfectly  the name of this man is not champmathieu  he is an ex convict named jean valjean  and is very vicious and much to be feared  it is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term  he underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft  he made five or six attempts to escape  besides the theft from little gervais  and from the pierron orchard  i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of his grace the late bishop of d  i often saw him at the time when i was adjutant of the galley guard at the prison in toulon  i repeat that i recognize him perfectly this extremely precise statement appeared to produce a vivid impression on the public and on the jury  the district attorney concluded by insisting  that in default of javert  the three witnesses brevet chenildieu  and cochepaille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated the president transmitted the order to an usher  and  a moment later the door of the witnesses  room opened  the usher  accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance  introduced the convict brevet  the audience was in suspense  and all breasts heaved as though they had contained but one soul the ex convict brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons  brevet was a person sixty years of age  who had a sort of business man s face  and the air of a rascal  the two sometimes go together  in prison  whither fresh misdeeds had led him  he had become something in the nature of a turnkey  he was a man of whom his superiors said  he tries to make himself of use  the chaplains bore good testimony as to his religious habits  it must not be forgotten that this passed under the restoration brevet  said the president  you have undergone an ignominious sentence  and you cannot take an oath brevet dropped his eyes nevertheless  continued the president  even in the man whom the law has degraded  there may remain  when the divine mercy permits it  a sentiment of honor and of equity  it is to this sentiment that i appeal at this decisive hour  if it still exists in you and i hope it does reflect before replying to me  consider on the one hand  this man  whom a word from you may ruin  on the other hand  justice  which a word from you may enlighten  the instant is solemn  there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken  rise  prisoner  brevet take a good look at the accused  recall your souvenirs  and tell us on your soul and conscience  if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys  jean valjean brevet looked at the prisoner  then turned towards the court yes  mr  president  i was the first to recognize him  and i stick to it  that man is jean valjean  who entered at toulon in  and left in  i left a year later  he has the air of a brute now  but it must be because age has brutalized him  he was sly at the galleys  i recognize him positively take your seat  said the president  prisoner  remain standing chenildieu was brought in  a prisoner for life  as was indicated by his red cassock and his green cap  he was serving out his sentence at the galleys of toulon  whence he had been brought for this case  he was a small man of about fifty  brisk  wrinkled  frail  yellow  brazen faced feverish  who had a sort of sickly feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person  and an immense force in his glance  his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i deny god je nie dieu  chenildieu the president addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to brevet  at the moment when he reminded him of his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath  chenildieu raised his head and looked the crowd in the face  the president invited him to reflection  and asked him as he had asked brevet  if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner chenildieu burst out laughing pardieu  as if i didn t recognize him  we were attached to the same chain for five years  so you are sulking  old fellow go take your seat  said the president the usher brought in cochepaille  he was another convict for life  who had come from the galleys  and was dressed in red  like chenildieu  was a peasant from lourdes  and a half bear of the pyrenees  he had guarded the flocks among the mountains  and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand  cochepaille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner  he was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts  and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words and asked him  as he had asked the other two  if he persisted  without hesitation or trouble  in recognizing the man who was standing before him he is jean valjean  said cochepaille  he was even called jean the screw  because he was so strong each of these affirmations from these three men  evidently sincere and in good faith  had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding the prisoner had listened to them  with that astounded face which was according to the accusation  his principal means of defence  at the first  the gendarmes  his neighbors  had heard him mutter between his teeth  ah  well  he s a nice one  after the second  he said  a little louder  with an air that was almost that of satisfaction  good  at the third  he cried  famous the president addressed him have you heard  prisoner  what have you to say he replied i say  famous an uproar broke out among the audience  and was communicated to the jury  it was evident that the man was lost ushers  said the president  enforce silence  i am going to sum up the arguments at that moment there was a movement just beside the president  a voice was heard crying brevet  chenildieu  cochepaille  look here all who heard that voice were chilled  so lamentable and terrible was it  all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded  a man placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court  had just risen  had pushed open the half door which separated the tribunal from the audience  and was standing in the middle of the hall the president  the district attorney  m  bamatabois  twenty persons recognized him  and exclaimed in concert m  madeleine chapter xi champmathieu more and more astonished it was he  in fact  the clerk s lamp illumined his countenance  he held his hat in his hand  there was no disorder in his clothing  his coat was carefully buttoned  he was very pale  and he trembled slightly his hair  which had still been gray on his arrival in arras  was now entirely white  it had turned white during the hour he had sat there all heads were raised  the sensation was indescribable  there was a momentary hesitation in the audience  the voice had been so heart rending  the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first  they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry  they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry this indecision only lasted a few seconds  even before the president and the district attorney could utter a word  before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture  the man whom all still called  at that moment  m  madeleine  had advanced towards the witnesses cochepaille brevet  and chenildieu do you not recognize me  said he all three remained speechless  and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him  cochepaille  who was intimidated  made a military salute  m  madeleine turned towards the jury and the court  and said in a gentle voice gentlemen of the jury  order the prisoner to be released  mr president  have me arrested  he is not the man whom you are in search of  it is i  i am jean valjean not a mouth breathed  the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave  those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done in the meantime  the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness  he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a few low toned words with the assistant judges  he addressed the public and asked in accents which all understood is there a physician present the district attorney took the word gentlemen of the jury  the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us  like yourselves  only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express  you all know  by reputation at least  the honorable m  madeleine  mayor of m  sur m if there is a physician in the audience  we join the president in requesting him to attend to m  madeleine  and to conduct him to his home m  madeleine did not allow the district attorney to finish  he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority  these are the words which he uttered  here they are literally  as they were written down  immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago i thank you  mr  district attorney  but i am not mad  you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error  release this man  i am fulfilling a duty  i am that miserable criminal  i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly  and i am telling you the truth  god who is on high  looks down on what i am doing at this moment  and that suffices  you can take me  for here i am  but i have done my best  i concealed myself under another name  i have become rich  i have become a mayor  i have tried to re enter the ranks of the honest  it seems that that is not to be done  in short  there are many things which i cannot tell  i will not narrate the story of my life to you  you will hear it one of these days  i robbed monseigneur the bishop  it is true  it is true that i robbed little gervais  they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch  perhaps it was not altogether his fault  listen  honorable judges  a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have has neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society  but  you see  the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing  the galleys make the convict what he is  reflect upon that  if you please  before going to the galleys  i was a poor peasant  with very little intelligence  a sort of idiot  the galleys wrought a change in me  i was stupid  i became vicious  i was a block of wood  i became a firebrand  later on indulgence and kindness saved me  as severity had ruined me  but  pardon me  you cannot understand what i am saying  you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace  the forty sou piece which i stole seven years ago  from little gervais  i have nothing farther to add take me  good god  the district attorney shakes his head  you say  m madeleine has gone mad  you do not believe me  that is distressing  do not  at least  condemn this man  what  these men do not recognize me  i wish javert were here  he would recognize me nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words he turned to the three convicts  and said well  i recognize you  do you remember  brevet he paused  hesitated for an instant  and said do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys brevet gave a start of surprise  and surveyed him from head to foot with a frightened air  he continued chenildieu  you who conferred on yourself the name of jenie dieu your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn  because you one day laid your shoulder against the chafing dish full of coals  in order to efface the three letters t  f  p  which are still visible  nevertheless answer  is this true it is true  said chenildieu he addressed himself to cochepaille cochepaille  you have  near the bend in your left arm  a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder  the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes  march   pull up your sleeve cochepaille pushed up his sleeve  all eyes were focused on him and on his bare arm a gendarme held a light close to it  there was the date the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still rends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it  it was a smile of triumph  it was also a smile of despair you see plainly  he said  that i am jean valjean in that chamber there were no longer either judges  accusers  nor gendarmes  there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play  the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting  the president that he was there to preside  the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend  it was a striking circumstance that no question was put  that no authority intervened  the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is  that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators  no one  probably  could have explained what he felt no one  probably  said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light  all felt themselves inwardly dazzled it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes  that was clear  the appearance of this man had sufficed to suffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously  without any further explanation  the whole crowd  as by a sort of electric revelation  understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead  the details  the hesitations  little possible oppositions  were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact it was an impression which vanished speedily  but which was irresistible at the moment i do not wish to disturb the court further  resumed jean valjean  i shall withdraw  since you do not arrest me  i have many things to do the district attorney knows who i am  he knows whither i am going  he can have me arrested when he likes he directed his steps towards the door  not a voice was raised  not an arm extended to hinder him  all stood aside  at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man  he traversed the crowd slowly  it was never known who opened the door  but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it  on arriving there he turned round and said i am at your command  mr  district attorney then he addressed the audience all of you  all who are present consider me worthy of pity  do you not  good god  when i think of what i was on the point of doing  i consider that i am to be envied  nevertheless  i should have preferred not to have had this occur he withdrew  and the door closed behind him as it had opened  for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by some one in the crowd less than an hour after this  the verdict of the jury freed the said champmathieu from all accusations  and champmathieu  being at once released  went off in a state of stupefaction  thinking that all men were fools  and comprehending nothing of this vision book eighth a counter blow chapter i in what mirror m  madeleine contemplates his hair the day had begun to dawn  fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish night  filled with happy visions  at daybreak she fell asleep  sister simplice  who had been watching with her  availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchona  the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments  bending over her drugs and phials  and scrutinizing things very closely  on account of the dimness which the half light of dawn spreads over all objects  suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek  m madeleine stood before her  he had just entered silently is it you  mr  mayor  she exclaimed he replied in a low voice how is that poor woman not so bad just now  but we have been very uneasy she explained to him what had passed  that fantine had been very ill the day before  and that she was better now  because she thought that the mayor had gone to montfermeil to get her child  the sister dared not question the mayor  but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there all that is good  said he  you were right not to undeceive her yes  responded the sister  but now  mr  mayor  she will see you and will not see her child  what shall we say to her he reflected for a moment god will inspire us  said he but we cannot tell a lie  murmured the sister  half aloud it was broad daylight in the room  the light fell full on m  madeleine s face  the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it good god  sir  she exclaimed  what has happened to you  your hair is perfectly white white  said he sister simplice had no mirror  she rummaged in a drawer  and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed  m  madeleine took the mirror  looked at his hair  and said well he uttered the word indifferently  and as though his mind were on something else the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this he inquired can i see her is not monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her said the sister  hardly venturing to put the question of course  but it will take two or three days at least if she were not to see monsieur le maire until that time  went on the sister  timidly  she would not know that monsieur le maire had returned  and it would be easy to inspire her with patience  and when the child arrived  she would naturally think monsieur le maire had just come with the child  we should not have to enact a lie m  madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments  then he said with his calm gravity no  sister  i must see her  i may  perhaps  be in haste the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps  which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor s speech  she replied  lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully in that case  she is asleep  but monsieur le maire may enter he made some remarks about a door which shut badly  and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman  then he entered fantine s chamber approached the bed and drew aside the curtains  she was asleep  her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies  and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death  but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which overspread her countenance  and which transfigured her in her sleep  her pallor had become whiteness  her cheeks were crimson  her long golden lashes  the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her  palpitated  though they remained closed and drooping  her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings  all ready to open wide and bear her away  which could be felt as they rustled  though they could not be seen  to see her thus  one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of  she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower  and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul m  madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed  gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix  as he had done two months before  on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum  they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping  he praying  only now  after the lapse of two months  her hair was gray and his was white the sister had not entered with him  he stood beside the bed  with his finger on his lips  as though there were some one in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence she opened her eyes  saw him  and said quietly  with a smile and cosette chapter ii fantine happy she made no movement of either surprise or of joy  she was joy itself that simple question  and cosette  was put with so profound a faith with so much certainty  with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt  that he found not a word of reply  she continued i knew that you were there  i was asleep  but i saw you  i have seen you for a long  long time  i have been following you with my eyes all night long  you were in a glory  and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms he raised his glance to the crucifix but  she resumed  tell me where cosette is  why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall fortunately  the doctor had been warned  and he now made his appearance he came to the aid of m  madeleine calm yourself  my child  said the doctor  your child is here fantine s eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light  she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness oh  she exclaimed  bring her to me touching illusion of a mother  cosette was  for her  still the little child who is carried not yet  said the doctor  not just now  you still have some fever the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm  you must be cured first she interrupted him impetuously but i am cured  oh  i tell you that i am cured  what an ass that doctor is  the idea  i want to see my child you see  said the doctor  how excited you become  so long as you are in this state i shall oppose your having your child  it is not enough to see her  it is necessary that you should live for her  when you are reasonable  i will bring her to you myself the poor mother bowed her head i beg your pardon  doctor  i really beg your pardon  formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done  so many misfortunes have happened to me  that i sometimes do not know what i am saying  i understand you you fear the emotion  i will wait as long as you like  but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter  i have been seeing her  i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening do you know  if she were brought to me now  i should talk to her very gently  that is all  is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter  who has been brought to me expressly from montfermeil  i am not angry  i know well that i am about to be happy  all night long i have seen white things  and persons who smiled at me  when monsieur le docteur pleases  he shall bring me cosette  i have no longer any fever i am well  i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me any more  but i am going to behave as though i were ill  and not stir  to please these ladies here  when it is seen that i am very calm they will say  she must have her child m  madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed  she turned towards him  she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good  as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy  in order that  seeing her so peaceable  they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her  but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m  madeleine did you have a pleasant trip  monsieur le maire  oh  how good you were to go and get her for me  only tell me how she is  did she stand the journey well  alas  she will not recognize me  she must have forgotten me by this time  poor darling  children have no memories  they are like birds  a child sees one thing to day and another thing to morrow  and thinks of nothing any longer  and did she have white linen  did those thenardiers keep her clean  how have they fed her  oh  if you only knew how i have suffered  putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness  now  it is all past  i am happy  oh  how i should like to see her  do you think her pretty  monsieur le maire is not my daughter beautiful  you must have been very cold in that diligence  could she not be brought for just one little instant  she might be taken away directly afterwards  tell me  you are the master  it could be so if you chose he took her hand  cosette is beautiful  he said  cosette is well you shall see her soon  but calm yourself  you are talking with too much vivacity  and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes  and that makes you cough in fact  fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word fantine did not murmur  she feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring  and she began to talk of indifferent things montfermeil is quite pretty  is it not  people go there on pleasure parties in summer  are the thenardiers prosperous  there are not many travellers in their parts  that inn of theirs is a sort of a cook shop m  madeleine was still holding her hand  and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated  the doctor  having finished his visit  retired  sister simplice remained alone with them but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed i hear her  mon dieu  i hear her she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her  held her breath and began to listen with rapture there was a child playing in the yard the child of the portress or of some work woman  it was one of those accidents which are always occurring  and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage setting of mournful scenes  the child a little girl was going and coming running to warm herself  laughing  singing at the top of her voice alas  in what are the plays of children not intermingled  it was this little girl whom fantine heard singing oh  she resumed  it is my cosette  i recognize her voice the child retreated as it had come  the voice died away  fantine listened for a while longer  then her face clouded over  and m madeleine heard her say  in a low voice  how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter  that man has an evil countenance  that he has but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again  she continued to talk to herself  with her head resting on the pillow  how happy we are going to be  we shall have a little garden the very first thing  m  madeleine has promised it to me  my daughter will play in the garden  she must know her letters by this time  i will make her spell she will run over the grass after butterflies  i will watch her  then she will take her first communion  ah  when will she take her first communion she began to reckon on her fingers one  two  three  four she is seven years old  in five years she will have a white veil  and openwork stockings  she will look like a little woman  o my good sister  you do not know how foolish i become when i think of my daughter s first communion she began to laugh he had released fantine s hand  he listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze  with his eyes on the ground  his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom  all at once she ceased speaking  and this caused him to raise his head mechanically  fantine had become terrible she no longer spoke  she no longer breathed  she had raised herself to a sitting posture  her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise  her face which had been radiant but a moment before  was ghastly  and she seemed to have fixed her eyes  rendered large with terror  on something alarming at the other extremity of the room good god  he exclaimed  what ails you  fantine she made no reply  she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see  she removed one hand from his arm  and with the other made him a sign to look behind him he turned  and beheld javert chapter iii javert satisfied this is what had taken place the half hour after midnight had just struck when m  madeleine quitted the hall of assizes in arras  he regained his inn just in time to set out again by the mail wagon  in which he had engaged his place  a little before six o clock in the morning he had arrived at m  sur m  and his first care had been to post a letter to m  laffitte  then to enter the infirmary and see fantine however  he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes  when the district attorney  recovering from his first shock had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m  sur m  to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident  which would be explained thereafter and to demand  in the meantime  the condemnation of that champmathieu who was evidently the real jean valjean  the district attorney s persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one  of the public  of the court  and of the jury  the counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that in consequence of the revelations of m  madeleine  that is to say  of the real jean valjean  the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered  and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man  thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphonemas  not very fresh unfortunately  upon judicial errors  etc  etc  the president  in his summing up  had joined the counsel for the defence  and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champmathieu out of the case nevertheless  the district attorney was bent on having a jean valjean and as he had no longer champmathieu  he took madeleine immediately after champmathieu had been set at liberty  the district attorney shut himself up with the president  they conferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m  le maire of m  sur m this phrase  in which there was a great deal of of  is the district attorney s  written with his own hand  on the minutes of his report to the attorney general  his first emotion having passed off  the president did not offer many objections  justice must  after all  take its course  and then  when all was said  although the president was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man  he was  at the same time  a devoted and almost an ardent royalist  and he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m  sur m  say the emperor  and not bonaparte  when alluding to the landing at cannes the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched  the district attorney forwarded it to m  sur m  by a special messenger  at full speed  and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert the reader knows that javert had returned to m  sur m  immediately after having given his deposition javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner the messenger himself was a very clever member of the police  who  in two words  informed javert of what had taken place at arras  the order of arrest  signed by the district attorney  was couched in these words inspector javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine  mayor of m  sur m  who  in this day s session of the court  was recognized as the liberated convict  jean valjean any one who did not know javert  and who had chanced to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary  could have divined nothing of what had taken place  and would have thought his air the most ordinary in the world  he was cool  calm  grave  his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples  and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation  any one who was thoroughly acquainted with him  and who had examined him attentively at the moment would have shuddered  the buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck  this betrayed unwonted agitation javert was a complete character  who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform  methodical with malefactors  rigid with the buttons of his coat that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry  it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes he had come in a simple way  had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers  had left the soldiers in the courtyard  had had fantine s room pointed out to him by the portress who was utterly unsuspicious  accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor on arriving at fantine s chamber  javert turned the handle  pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick nurse or a police spy  and entered properly speaking  he did not enter  he stood erect in the half open door  his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat  which was buttoned up to the chin  in the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous cane  which was hidden behind him  could be seen thus he remained for nearly a minute  without his presence being perceived  all at once fantine raised her eyes  saw him  and made m madeleine turn round the instant that madeleine s glance encountered javert s glance  javert without stirring  without moving from his post  without approaching him became terrible  no human sentiment can be as terrible as joy it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul the satisfaction of at last getting hold of jean valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance  the depths having been stirred up  mounted to the surface  the humiliation of having  in some slight degree  lost the scent  and of having indulged  for a few moments  in an error with regard to champmathieu  was effaced by pride at having so well and accurately divined in the first place  and of having for so long cherished a just instinct  javert s content shone forth in his sovereign attitude  the deformity of triumph overspread that narrow brow  all the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there javert was in heaven at that moment  without putting the thing clearly to himself  but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success  he  javert  personified justice  light  and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil  behind him and around him  at an infinite distance  he had authority  reason  the case judged  the legal conscience  the public prosecution  all the stars  he was protecting order  he was causing the law to yield up its thunders he was avenging society  he was lending a helping hand to the absolute he was standing erect in the midst of a glory  there existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat  erect  haughty  brilliant he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel  the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist  happy and indignant  he held his heel upon crime  vice  rebellion perdition  hell  he was radiant  he exterminated  he smiled  and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael javert  though frightful  had nothing ignoble about him probity  sincerity  candor  conviction  the sense of duty  are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed  but which  even when hideous  remain grand  their majesty  the majesty peculiar to the human conscience  clings to them in the midst of horror  they are virtues which have one vice error  the honest  pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubriously venerable radiance  without himself suspecting the fact  javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied  as is every ignorant man who triumphs  nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good chapter iv authority reasserts its rights fantine had not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had torn her from the man  her ailing brain comprehended nothing  but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her  she could not endure that terrible face  she felt her life quitting her  she hid her face in both hands  and shrieked in her anguish monsieur madeleine  save me jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen he said to fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices be at ease  it is not for you that he is come then he addressed javert  and said i know what you want javert replied be quick about it there lay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied  javert did not say  be quick about it  he said bequiabouit no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered it was no longer a human word  it was a roar he did not proceed according to his custom  he did not enter into the matter  he exhibited no warrant of arrest  in his eyes  jean valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant  who was not to be laid hands upon a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years  without being able to throw him  this arrest was not a beginning but an end  he confined himself to saying  be quick about it as he spoke thus  he did not advance a single step  he hurled at jean valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook  and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him it was this glance which fantine had felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously at javert s exclamation  fantine opened her eyes once more  but the mayor was there  what had she to fear javert advanced to the middle of the room  and cried see here now  art thou coming the unhappy woman glanced about her  no one was present excepting the nun and the mayor  to whom could that abject use of thou  be addressed to her only  she shuddered then she beheld a most unprecedented thing  a thing so unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest deliriums of fever she beheld javert  the police spy  seize the mayor by the collar  she saw the mayor bow his head  it seemed to her that the world was coming to an end javert had  in fact  grasped jean valjean by the collar monsieur le maire  shrieked fantine javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums there is no longer any monsieur le maire here jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat  he said javert javert interrupted him  call me mr  inspector monsieur  said jean valjean  i should like to say a word to you in private aloud  say it aloud  replied javert  people are in the habit of talking aloud to me jean valjean went on in a lower tone i have a request to make of you i tell you to speak loud but you alone should hear it what difference does that make to me  i shall not listen jean valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low voice grant me three days  grace  three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman  i will pay whatever is necessary  you shall accompany me if you choose you are making sport of me  cried javert  come now  i did not think you such a fool  you ask me to give you three days in which to run away you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature s child ah  ah  that s good  that s really capital fantine was seized with a fit of trembling my child  she cried  to go and fetch my child  she is not here then  answer me  sister  where is cosette  i want my child  monsieur madeleine  monsieur le maire javert stamped his foot and now there s the other one  will you hold your tongue  you hussy it s a pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates  and where women of the town are cared for like countesses  ah  but we are going to change all that  it is high time he stared intently at fantine  and added  once more taking into his grasp jean valjean s cravat  shirt and collar i tell you that there is no monsieur madeleine and that there is no monsieur le maire  there is a thief  a brigand  a convict named jean valjean  and i have him in my grasp  that s what there is fantine raised herself in bed with a bound  supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on both hands  she gazed at jean valjean  she gazed at javert  she gazed at the nun  she opened her mouth as though to speak  a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat  her teeth chattered  she stretched out her arms in her agony  opening her hands convulsively  and fumbling about her like a drowning person  then suddenly fell back on her pillow her head struck the head board of the bed and fell forwards on her breast  with gaping mouth and staring  sightless eyes she was dead jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of javert  and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby  then he said to javert you have murdered that woman let s have an end of this  shouted javert  in a fury  i am not here to listen to argument  let us economize all that  the guard is below march on instantly  or you ll get the thumb screws in the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead  which was in a decidedly decrepit state  and which served the sisters as a camp bed when they were watching with the sick  jean valjean stepped up to this bed  in a twinkling wrenched off the head piece  which was already in a dilapidated condition  an easy matter to muscles like his  grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon  and glanced at javert  javert retreated towards the door  jean valjean  armed with his bar of iron  walked slowly up to fantine s couch  when he arrived there he turned and said to javert  in a voice that was barely audible i advise you not to disturb me at this moment one thing is certain  and that is  that javert trembled it did occur to him to summon the guard  but jean valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape  so he remained  grasped his cane by the small end  and leaned against the door post  without removing his eyes from jean valjean jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed  and his brow on his hand  and began to contemplate the motionless body of fantine  which lay extended there  he remained thus  mute  absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity  after a few moments of this meditation he bent towards fantine and spoke to her in a low voice what did he say to her  what could this man  who was reproved  say to that woman  who was dead  what words were those  no one on earth heard them  did the dead woman hear them  there are some touching illusions which are  perhaps  sublime realities  the point as to which there exists no doubt is  that sister simplice  the sole witness of the incident  often said that at the moment that jean valjean whispered in fantine s ear  she distinctly beheld an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips  and in those dim eyes  filled with the amazement of the tomb jean valjean took fantine s head in both his hands  and arranged it on the pillow as a mother might have done for her child  then he tied the string of her chemise  and smoothed her hair back under her cap  that done  he closed her eyes fantine s face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment death  that signifies entrance into the great light fantine s hand was hanging over the side of the bed  jean valjean knelt down before that hand  lifted it gently  and kissed it then he rose  and turned to javert now  said he  i am at your disposal chapter v a suitable tomb javert deposited jean valjean in the city prison the arrest of m  madeleine occasioned a sensation  or rather  an extraordinary commotion in m  sur m  we are sorry that we cannot conceal the fact  that at the single word  he was a convict  nearly every one deserted him  in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten  and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys  it is just to add that the details of what had taken place at arras were not yet known  all day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town you don t know  he was a liberated convict  who  the mayor  bah m  madeleine  yes  really  his name was not madeleine at all  he had a frightful name  bejean  bojean  boujean  ah  good god  he has been arrested  arrested  in prison  in the city prison  while waiting to be transferred  until he is transferred  he is to be transferred  where is he to be taken  he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago  well  i suspected as much  that man was too good  too perfect  too affected he refused the cross  he bestowed sous on all the little scamps he came across  i always thought there was some evil history back of all that the drawing rooms  particularly abounded in remarks of this nature one old lady  a subscriber to the drapeau blanc  made the following remark  the depth of which it is impossible to fathom i am not sorry  it will be a lesson to the bonapartists it was thus that the phantom which had been called m  madeleine vanished from m  sur m  only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory  the old portress who had served him was among the number on the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge  still in a thorough fright  and absorbed in sad reflections the factory had been closed all day  the carriage gate was bolted  the street was deserted  there was no one in the house but the two nuns sister perpetue and sister simplice  who were watching beside the body of fantine towards the hour when m  madeleine was accustomed to return home the good portress rose mechanically  took from a drawer the key of m  madeleine s chamber  and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters  then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it  and set the candlestick on one side  as though she was expecting him  then she sat down again on her chair  and became absorbed in thought once more  the poor  good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from her revery  and exclaimed  hold  my good god jesus  and i hung his key on the nail at that moment the small window in the lodge opened  a hand passed through  seized the key and the candlestick  and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there the portress raised her eyes  and stood there with gaping mouth  and a shriek which she confined to her throat she knew that hand  that arm  the sleeve of that coat it was m  madeleine it was several seconds before she could speak  she had a seizure  as she said herself  when she related the adventure afterwards good god  monsieur le maire  she cried at last  i thought you were she stopped  the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning  jean valjean was still monsieur le maire to her he finished her thought in prison  said he  i was there  i broke a bar of one of the windows i let myself drop from the top of a roof  and here i am  i am going up to my room  go and find sister simplice for me  she is with that poor woman  no doubt the old woman obeyed in all haste he gave her no orders  he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself no one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates  he had  and always carried about him a pass key which opened a little side door  but he must have been searched  and his latch key must have been taken from him  this point was never explained he ascended the staircase leading to his chamber  on arriving at the top  he left his candle on the top step of his stairs  opened his door with very little noise  went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling  then returned for his candle and re entered his room it was a useful precaution  it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street he cast a glance about him  at his table  at his chair  at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days  no trace of the disorder of the night before last remained  the portress had done up  his room  only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty sou piece which had been blackened by the fire he took a sheet of paper  on which he wrote  these are the two tips of my iron shod cudgel and the forty sou piece stolen from little gervais which i mentioned at the court of assizes  and he arranged this piece of paper  the bits of iron  and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room  from a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts  which he tore in pieces  in the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks  he betrayed neither haste nor agitation  and while he was wrapping up the bishop s candlesticks  he nibbled at a piece of black bread  it was probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on there came two taps at the door come in  said he it was sister simplice she was pale  her eyes were red  the candle which she carried trembled in her hand  the peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is  that however polished or cool we may be  they wring human nature from our very bowels  and force it to reappear on the surface  the emotions of that day had turned the nun into a woman once more  she had wept  and she was trembling jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper  which he handed to the nun  saying  sister  you will give this to monsieur le cure the paper was not folded  she cast a glance upon it you can read it  said he she read i beg monsieur le cure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me  he will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial  and of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday  the rest is for the poor the sister tried to speak  but she only managed to stammer a few inarticulate sounds  she succeeded in saying  however does not monsieur le maire desire to take a last look at that poor unhappy woman no  said he  i am pursued  it would only end in their arresting me in that room  and that would disturb her he had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase  they heard a tumult of ascending footsteps  and the old portress saying in her loudest and most piercing tones my good sir  i swear to you by the good god  that not a soul has entered this house all day  nor all the evening  and that i have not even left the door a man responded but there is a light in that room  nevertheless they recognized javert s voice the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of the wall on the right  jean valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this angle  sister simplice fell on her knees near the table the door opened javert entered the whispers of many men and the protestations of the portress were audible in the corridor the nun did not raise her eyes  she was praying the candle was on the chimney piece  and gave but very little light javert caught sight of the nun and halted in amazement it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert  his element the very air he breathed  was veneration for all authority  this was impregnable  and admitted of neither objection nor restriction  in his eyes  of course  the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all  he was religious  superficial and correct on this point as on all others in his eyes  a priest was a mind  who never makes a mistake  a nun was a creature who never sins  they were souls walled in from this world with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through on perceiving the sister  his first movement was to retire but there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him imperiously in the opposite direction  his second movement was to remain and to venture on at least one question this was sister simplice  who had never told a lie in her life  javert knew it  and held her in special veneration in consequence sister  said he  are you alone in this room a terrible moment ensued  during which the poor portress felt as though she should faint the sister raised her eyes and answered yes then  resumed javert  you will excuse me if i persist  it is my duty you have not seen a certain person a man this evening  he has escaped we are in search of him that jean valjean  you have not seen him the sister replied no she lied  she had lied twice in succession  one after the other  without hesitation  promptly  as a person does when sacrificing herself pardon me  said javert  and he retired with a deep bow o sainted maid  you left this world many years ago  you have rejoined your sisters  the virgins  and your brothers  the angels  in the light may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise the sister s affirmation was for javert so decisive a thing that he did not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been extinguished  and which was still smoking on the table an hour later  a man  marching amid trees and mists  was rapidly departing from m  sur m  in the direction of paris  that man was jean valjean  it has been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him  that he was carrying a bundle  that he was dressed in a blouse  where had he obtained that blouse  no one ever found out but an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before  leaving behind him nothing but his blouse  perhaps that was the one one last word about fantine we all have a mother the earth  fantine was given back to that mother the cure thought that he was doing right  and perhaps he really was  in reserving as much money as possible from what jean valjean had left for the poor  who was concerned  after all  a convict and a woman of the town  that is why he had a very simple funeral for fantine  and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper s grave so fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody  and where the poor are lost  fortunately  god knows where to find the soul again  fantine was laid in the shade among the first bones that came to hand  she was subjected to the promiscuousness of ashes  she was thrown into the public grave  her grave resembled her bed the end of volume i  fantine illustration  frontispiece volume two  frontispiece illustration  titlepage volume two  titlepage volume ii cosette book first waterloo chapter i what is met with on the way from nivelles last year  on a beautiful may morning  a traveller  the person who is telling this story  was coming from nivelles  and directing his course towards la hulpe  he was on foot  he was pursuing a broad paved road  which undulated between two rows of trees  over the hills which succeed each other  raise the road and let it fall again  and produce something in the nature of enormous waves he had passed lillois and bois seigneur isaac  in the west he perceived the slate roofed tower of braine l alleud  which has the form of a reversed vase  he had just left behind a wood upon an eminence  and at the angle of the cross road  by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription ancient barrier no   a public house  bearing on its front this sign  at the four winds aux quatre vents  echabeau private cafe a quarter of a league further on  he arrived at the bottom of a little valley  where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road  the clump of sparsely planted but very green trees  which fills the valley on one side of the road  is dispersed over the meadows on the other  and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of braine l alleud on the right  close to the road  was an inn  with a four wheeled cart at the door  a large bundle of hop poles  a plough  a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing hedge  lime smoking in a square hole  and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions  a young girl was weeding in a field  where a huge yellow poster  probably of some outside spectacle  such as a parish festival  was fluttering in the wind  at one corner of the inn  beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating  a badly paved path plunged into the bushes  the wayfarer struck into this after traversing a hundred paces  skirting a wall of the fifteenth century  surmounted by a pointed gable  with bricks set in contrast  he found himself before a large door of arched stone  with a rectilinear impost  in the sombre style of louis xiv  flanked by two flat medallions  a severe facade rose above this door  a wall  perpendicular to the facade  almost touched the door  and flanked it with an abrupt right angle  in the meadow before the door lay three harrows  through which  in disorder  grew all the flowers of may  the door was closed the two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker the sun was charming  the branches had that soft shivering of may which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind  a brave little bird  probably a lover  was carolling in a distracted manner in a large tree the wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation resembling the hollow of a sphere  in the stone on the left  at the foot of the pier of the door at this moment the leaves of the door parted  and a peasant woman emerged she saw the wayfarer  and perceived what he was looking at it was a french cannon ball which made that  she said to him  and she added that which you see there  higher up in the door  near a nail  is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg  the bullet did not pierce the wood what is the name of this place  inquired the wayfarer hougomont  said the peasant woman the traveller straightened himself up  he walked on a few paces  and went off to look over the tops of the hedges  on the horizon through the trees  he perceived a sort of little elevation  and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion he was on the battle field of waterloo chapter ii hougomont hougomont this was a funereal spot  the beginning of the obstacle the first resistance  which that great wood cutter of europe  called napoleon  encountered at waterloo  the first knot under the blows of his axe it was a chateau  it is no longer anything but a farm  for the antiquary  hougomont is hugomons  this manor was built by hugo  sire of somerel  the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the abbey of villiers the traveller pushed open the door  elbowed an ancient calash under the porch  and entered the courtyard the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century  which here simulates an arcade  everything else having fallen prostrate around it  a monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin  in a wall near the arcade opens another arched door  of the time of henry iv  permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard beside this door  a manure hole  some pickaxes  some shovels  some carts  an old well  with its flagstone and its iron reel  a chicken jumping  and a turkey spreading its tail  a chapel surmounted by a small bell tower  a blossoming pear tree trained in espalier against the wall of the chapel behold the court  the conquest of which was one of napoleon s dreams  this corner of earth  could he but have seized it  would  perhaps  have given him the world likewise  chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks  a growl is audible  it is a huge dog  who shows his teeth and replaces the english the english behaved admirably there  cooke s four companies of guards there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army hougomont viewed on the map  as a geometrical plan  comprising buildings and enclosures  presents a sort of irregular rectangle  one angle of which is nicked out  it is this angle which contains the southern door  guarded by this wall  which commands it only a gun s length away hougomont has two doors the southern door  that of the chateau  and the northern door  belonging to the farm  napoleon sent his brother jerome against hougomont  the divisions of foy  guilleminot  and bachelu hurled themselves against it  nearly the entire corps of reille was employed against it  and miscarried  kellermann s balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall  bauduin s brigade was not strong enough to force hougomont on the north  and the brigade of soye could not do more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south  but without taking it the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south  a bit of the north door  broken by the french  hangs suspended to the wall  it consists of four planks nailed to two cross beams  on which the scars of the attack are visible the northern door  which was beaten in by the french  and which has had a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall  stands half open at the bottom of the paddock  it is cut squarely in the wall built of stone below  of brick above which closes in the courtyard on the north  it is a simple door for carts  such as exist in all farms with the two large leaves made of rustic planks  beyond lie the meadows the dispute over this entrance was furious  for a long time  all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door posts  it was there that bauduin was killed the storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard  its horror is visible there  the confusion of the fray was petrified there  it lives and it dies there  it was only yesterday  the walls are in the death agony  the stones fall  the breaches cry aloud  the holes are wounds the drooping  quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee this courtyard was more built up in  than it is to day  buildings which have since been pulled down then formed redans and angles the english barricaded themselves there  the french made their way in but could not stand their ground  beside the chapel  one wing of the chateau  the only ruin now remaining of the manor of hougomont  rises in a crumbling state disembowelled  one might say  the chateau served for a dungeon  the chapel for a block house  there men exterminated each other  the french  fired on from every point from behind the walls from the summits of the garrets  from the depths of the cellars  through all the casements  through all the air holes  through every crack in the stones fetched fagots and set fire to walls and men  the reply to the grape shot was a conflagration in the ruined wing  through windows garnished with bars of iron  the dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible  the english guards were in ambush in these rooms  the spiral of the staircase  cracked from the ground floor to the very roof  appears like the inside of a broken shell  the staircase has two stories  the english  besieged on the staircase  and massed on its upper steps  had cut off the lower steps  these consisted of large slabs of blue stone which form a heap among the nettles  half a score of steps still cling to the wall  on the first is cut the figure of a trident  these inaccessible steps are solid in their niches  all the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth  there are two old trees there one is dead  the other is wounded at its base  and is clothed with verdure in april  since  it has taken to growing through the staircase a massacre took place in the chapel  the interior  which has recovered its calm  is singular  the mass has not been said there since the carnage  nevertheless  the altar has been left there an altar of unpolished wood  placed against a background of roughhewn stone  four whitewashed walls  a door opposite the altar  two small arched windows over the door a large wooden crucifix  below the crucifix a square air hole stopped up with a bundle of hay  on the ground  in one corner an old window frame with the glass all broken to pieces such is the chapel  near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of saint anne of the fifteenth century  the head of the infant jesus has been carried off by a large ball  the french  who were masters of the chapel for a moment  and were then dislodged  set fire to it  the flames filled this building  it was a perfect furnace  the door was burned  the floor was burned  the wooden christ was not burned  the fire preyed upon his feet  of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen  then it stopped a miracle  according to the assertion of the people of the neighborhood  the infant jesus  decapitated  was less fortunate than the christ the walls are covered with inscriptions  near the feet of christ this name is to be read  henquinez  then these others  conde de rio maior marques y marquesa de almagro habana  there are french names with exclamation points a sign of wrath  the wall was freshly whitewashed in  the nations insulted each other there it was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held an axe in its hand  this corpse was sub lieutenant legros on emerging from the chapel  a well is visible on the left  there are two in this courtyard  one inquires  why is there no bucket and pulley to this  it is because water is no longer drawn there  why is water not drawn there  because it is full of skeletons the last person who drew water from the well was named guillaume van kylsom  he was a peasant who lived at hougomont  and was gardener there on the th of june   his family fled and concealed themselves in the woods the forest surrounding the abbey of villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad  for many days and nights  there are at this day certain traces recognizable  such as old boles of burned trees  which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the thickets guillaume van kylsom remained at hougomont  to guard the chateau  and concealed himself in the cellar  the english discovered him there they tore him from his hiding place  and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them  by administering blows with the flats of their swords  they were thirsty  this guillaume brought them water  it was from this well that he drew it  many drank there their last draught this well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself after the engagement  they were in haste to bury the dead bodies  death has a fashion of harassing victory  and she causes the pest to follow glory  the typhus is a concomitant of triumph  this well was deep  and it was turned into a sepulchre  three hundred dead bodies were cast into it  with too much haste perhaps  were they all dead  legend says they were not  it seems that on the night succeeding the interment  feeble voices were heard calling from the well this well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard  three walls  part stone  part brick  and simulating a small  square tower  and folded like the leaves of a screen  surround it on all sides  the fourth side is open  it is there that the water was drawn  the wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole  possibly the hole made by a shell  this little tower had a platform  of which only the beams remain  the iron supports of the well on the right form a cross  on leaning over  the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped up mass of shadows  the base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles this well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the table for all wells in belgium  the slab has here been replaced by a cross beam  against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones  there is no longer either pail  chain  or pulley  but there is still the stone basin which served the overflow  the rain water collects there  and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink  and then flies away  one house in this ruin  the farmhouse  is still inhabited  the door of this house opens on the courtyard  upon this door  beside a pretty gothic lock plate  there is an iron handle with trefoils placed slanting  at the moment when the hanoverian lieutenant  wilda  grasped this handle in order to take refuge in the farm  a french sapper hewed off his hand with an axe the family who occupy the house had for their grandfather guillaume van kylsom  the old gardener  dead long since  a woman with gray hair said to us  i was there  i was three years old  my sister  who was older was terrified and wept  they carried us off to the woods  i went there in my mother s arms  we glued our ears to the earth to hear  i imitated the cannon  and went boum  boum a door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard  so we were told  the orchard is terrible it is in three parts  one might almost say  in three acts  the first part is a garden  the second is an orchard  the third is a wood  these three parts have a common enclosure  on the side of the entrance  the buildings of the chateau and the farm  on the left  a hedge  on the right  a wall  and at the end  a wall  the wall on the right is of brick  the wall at the bottom is of stone  one enters the garden first it slopes downwards  is planted with gooseberry bushes  choked with a wild growth of vegetation  and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone  with balustrade with a double curve it was a seignorial garden in the first french style which preceded le notre  to day it is ruins and briars  the pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon balls of stone  forty three balusters can still be counted on their sockets  the rest lie prostrate in the grass almost all bear scratches of bullets  one broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg it was in this garden  further down than the orchard  that six light infantry men of the st  having made their way thither  and being unable to escape  hunted down and caught like bears in their dens accepted the combat with two hanoverian companies  one of which was armed with carbines  the hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above  the infantry men  replying from below  six against two hundred  intrepid and with no shelter save the currant bushes  took a quarter of an hour to die one mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard properly speaking  there  within the limits of those few square fathoms fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour  the wall seems ready to renew the combat  thirty eight loopholes  pierced by the english at irregular heights  are there still  in front of the sixth are placed two english tombs of granite  there are loopholes only in the south wall  as the principal attack came from that quarter  the wall is hidden on the outside by a tall hedge  the french came up  thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge  crossed it  and found the wall both an obstacle and an ambuscade  with the english guards behind it  the thirty eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grape shot and balls  and soye s brigade was broken against it  thus waterloo began nevertheless  the orchard was taken  as they had no ladders  the french scaled it with their nails  they fought hand to hand amid the trees all this grass has been soaked in blood  a battalion of nassau  seven hundred strong  was overwhelmed there  the outside of the wall  against which kellermann s two batteries were trained  is gnawed by grape shot this orchard is sentient  like others  in the month of may  it has its buttercups and its daisies  the grass is tall there  the cart horses browse there  cords of hair  on which linen is drying  traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passer by to bend his head  one walks over this uncultivated land  and one s foot dives into mole holes in the middle of the grass one observes an uprooted tree bole which lies there all verdant  major blackmann leaned against it to die  beneath a great tree in the neighborhood fell the german general  duplat descended from a french family which fled on the revocation of the edict of nantes  an aged and falling apple tree leans far over to one side its wound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loam  nearly all the apple trees are falling with age  there is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscayan  the skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard  crows fly through their branches  and at the end of it is a wood full of violets bauduin  killed  foy wounded  conflagration  massacre  carnage  a rivulet formed of english blood  french blood  german blood mingled in fury  a well crammed with corpses  the regiment of nassau and the regiment of brunswick destroyed  duplat killed  blackmann killed  the english guards mutilated  twenty french battalions  besides the forty from reille s corps  decimated  three thousand men in that hovel of hougomont alone cut down  slashed to pieces  shot  burned  with their throats cut and all this so that a peasant can say to day to the traveller  monsieur  give me three francs  and if you like  i will explain to you the affair of waterloo chapter iii the eighteenth of june  let us turn back that is one of the story teller s rights and put ourselves once more in the year  and even a little earlier than the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took place if it had not rained in the night between the th and the th of june   the fate of europe would have been different  a few drops of water  more or less  decided the downfall of napoleon  all that providence required in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz was a little more rain  and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble the battle of waterloo could not be begun until half past eleven o clock  and that gave blucher time to come up  why  because the ground was wet  the artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before they could manoeuvre napoleon was an artillery officer  and felt the effects of this  the foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who  in the report to the directory on aboukir  said  such a one of our balls killed six men all his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles  the key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point  he treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel  and made a breach in it he overwhelmed the weak point with grape shot  he joined and dissolved battles with cannon  there was something of the sharpshooter in his genius  to beat in squares  to pulverize regiments  to break lines  to crush and disperse masses for him everything lay in this  to strike  strike  strike incessantly and he intrusted this task to the cannon ball  a redoubtable method  and one which  united with genius rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years on the th of june   he relied all the more on his artillery because he had numbers on his side  wellington had only one hundred and fifty nine mouths of fire  napoleon had two hundred and forty suppose the soil dry  and the artillery capable of moving  the action would have begun at six o clock in the morning  the battle would have been won and ended at two o clock  three hours before the change of fortune in favor of the prussians  what amount of blame attaches to napoleon for the loss of this battle  is the shipwreck due to the pilot was it the evident physical decline of napoleon that complicated this epoch by an inward diminution of force  had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard  the soul as well as the body did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader  in a word was this genius  as many historians of note have thought  suffering from an eclipse  did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself  did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure  had he become a grave matter in a general unconscious of peril  is there an age  in this class of material great men  who may be called the giants of action  when genius grows short sighted  old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal for the dantes and michael angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness is it to grow less for the hannibals and the bonapartes  had napoleon lost the direct sense of victory  had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef  could no longer divine the snare  no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses  had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes  he who had in former days known all the roads to triumph  and who  from the summit of his chariot of lightning pointed them out with a sovereign finger  had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it  to the precipice  was he seized at the age of forty six with a supreme madness  was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than an immense dare devil we do not think so his plan of battle was  by the confession of all  a masterpiece  to go straight to the centre of the allies  line  to make a breach in the enemy  to cut them in two  to drive the british half back on hal and the prussian half on tongres  to make two shattered fragments of wellington and blucher  to carry mont saint jean  to seize brussels to hurl the german into the rhine  and the englishman into the sea  all this was contained in that battle  according to napoleon  afterwards people would see of course  we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of waterloo  one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle  but this history is not our subject  this history  moreover  has been finished  and finished in a masterly manner  from one point of view by napoleon  and from another point of view by a whole pleiad of historians as for us  we leave the historians at loggerheads  we are but a distant witness  a passer by on the plain  a seeker bending over that soil all made of human flesh  taking appearances for realities  perchance  we have no right to oppose  in the name of science  a collection of facts which contain illusions  no doubt  we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorize a system  in our opinion  a chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at waterloo  and when it becomes a question of destiny  that mysterious culprit  we judge like that ingenious judge  the populace chapter iv a those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of waterloo have only to place  mentally  on the ground  a capital a  the left limb of the a is the road to nivelles  the right limb is the road to genappe the tie of the a is the hollow road to ohain from braine l alleud  the top of the a is mont saint jean  where wellington is  the lower left tip is hougomont  where reille is stationed with jerome bonaparte  the right tip is the belle alliance  where napoleon was  at the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced  it was there that the lion has been placed  the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the imperial guard the triangle included in the top of the a  between the two limbs and the tie  is the plateau of mont saint jean  the dispute over this plateau constituted the whole battle  the wings of the two armies extended to the right and left of the two roads to genappe and nivelles  d erlon facing picton  reille facing hill behind the tip of the a  behind the plateau of mont saint jean  is the forest of soignes as for the plain itself  let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground  each rise commands the next rise  and all the undulations mount towards mont saint jean  and there end in the forest two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers  it is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist  the one seeks to trip up the other  they clutch at everything  a bush is a point of support an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder  for the lack of a hovel under whose cover they can draw up  a regiment yields its ground  an unevenness in the ground  a chance turn in the landscape  a cross path encountered at the right moment  a grove  a ravine  can stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army  and prevent its retreat  he who quits the field is beaten  hence the necessity devolving on the responsible leader  of examining the most insignificant clump of trees  and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground the two generals had attentively studied the plain of mont saint jean now called the plain of waterloo  in the preceding year  wellington with the sagacity of foresight  had examined it as the possible seat of a great battle  upon this spot  and for this duel  on the th of june wellington had the good post  napoleon the bad post  the english army was stationed above  the french army below it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on horseback  glass in hand  upon the heights of rossomme  at daybreak  on june   all the world has seen him before we can show him that calm profile under the little three cornered hat of the school of brienne  that green uniform  the white revers concealing the star of the legion of honor  his great coat hiding his epaulets  the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest  his leather trousers  the white horse with the saddle cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned n s and eagles  hessian boots over silk stockings  silver spurs the sword of marengo that whole figure of the last of the caesars is present to all imaginations  saluted with acclamations by some  severely regarded by others that figure stood for a long time wholly in the light  this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes  and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time  but to day history and daylight have arrived that light called history is pitiless  it possesses this peculiar and divine quality  that  pure light as it is  and precisely because it is wholly light  it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto beheld rays  from the same man it constructs two different phantoms  and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it  and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations babylon violated lessens alexander  rome enchained lessens caesar jerusalem murdered lessens titus  tyranny follows the tyrant  it is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form chapter v the quid obscurum of battles every one is acquainted with the first phase of this battle  a beginning which was troubled  uncertain  hesitating  menacing to both armies  but still more so for the english than for the french it had rained all night  the earth had been cut up by the downpour  the water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as if in casks  at some points the gear of the artillery carriages was buried up to the axles  the circingles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud  if the wheat and rye trampled down by this cohort of transports on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the wheels  all movement  particularly in the valleys  in the direction of papelotte would have been impossible the affair began late  napoleon  as we have already explained  was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand  like a pistol aiming it now at one point  now at another  of the battle  and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely  in order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil  but the sun did not make its appearance  it was no longer the rendezvous of austerlitz  when the first cannon was fired the english general  colville  looked at his watch  and noted that it was thirty five minutes past eleven the action was begun furiously  with more fury  perhaps  than the emperor would have wished  by the left wing of the french resting on hougomont  at the same time napoleon attacked the centre by hurling quiot s brigade on la haie sainte  and ney pushed forward the right wing of the french against the left wing of the english  which rested on papelotte the attack on hougomont was something of a feint  the plan was to draw wellington thither  and to make him swerve to the left  this plan would have succeeded if the four companies of the english guards and the brave belgians of perponcher s division had not held the position solidly  and wellington  instead of massing his troops there  could confine himself to despatching thither  as reinforcements  only four more companies of guards and one battalion from brunswick the attack of the right wing of the french on papelotte was calculated in fact  to overthrow the english left  to cut off the road to brussels to bar the passage against possible prussians  to force mont saint jean to turn wellington back on hougomont  thence on braine l alleud  thence on hal  nothing easier  with the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded papelotte was taken  la haie sainte was carried a detail to be noted  there was in the english infantry  particularly in kempt s brigade  a great many raw recruits  these young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry  their inexperience extricated them intrepidly from the dilemma  they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers  the soldier skirmisher  left somewhat to himself  becomes  so to speak  his own general  these recruits displayed some of the french ingenuity and fury  this novice of an infantry had dash  this displeased wellington after the taking of la haie sainte the battle wavered there is in this day an obscure interval  from mid day to four o clock the middle portion of this battle is almost indistinct  and participates in the sombreness of the hand to hand conflict  twilight reigns over it we perceive vast fluctuations in that fog  a dizzy mirage  paraphernalia of war almost unknown to day  pendant colbacks  floating sabre taches cross belts  cartridge boxes for grenades  hussar dolmans  red boots with a thousand wrinkles  heavy shakos garlanded with torsades  the almost black infantry of brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of england  the english soldiers with great  white circular pads on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets  the hanoverian light horse with their oblong casques of leather  with brass hands and red horse tails the scotch with their bare knees and plaids  the great white gaiters of our grenadiers  pictures  not strategic lines what salvator rosa requires  not what is suited to the needs of gribeauval a certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle  quid obscurum  quid divinum  each historian traces  to some extent  the particular feature which pleases him amid this pell mell  whatever may be the combinations of the generals  the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb  during the action the plans of the two leaders enter into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape  such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another  just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them  it becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like  a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen  the line of battle waves and undulates like a thread  the trails of blood gush illogically  the fronts of the armies waver  the regiments form capes and gulfs as they enter and withdraw  all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other  where the infantry stood the artillery arrives  the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was  the battalions are like smoke  there was something there  seek it  it has disappeared  the open spots change place  the sombre folds advance and retreat  a sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward  hurls back distends  and disperses these tragic multitudes  what is a fray  an oscillation  the immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute not a day  in order to depict a battle  there is required one of those powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes  rembrandt is better than vandermeulen  vandermeulen  exact at noon  lies at three o clock geometry is deceptive  the hurricane alone is trustworthy  that is what confers on folard the right to contradict polybius  let us add  that there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat becomes specialized  and disperses into innumerable detailed feats which  to borrow the expression of napoleon himself  belong rather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army  the historian has  in this case  the evident right to sum up the whole  he cannot do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle  and it is not given to any one narrator  however conscientious he may be to fix  absolutely  the form of that horrible cloud which is called a battle this  which is true of all great armed encounters  is particularly applicable to waterloo nevertheless  at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a point chapter vi four o clock in the afternoon towards four o clock the condition of the english army was serious  the prince of orange was in command of the centre  hill of the right wing picton of the left wing  the prince of orange  desperate and intrepid shouted to the hollando belgians  nassau  brunswick  never retreat hill  having been weakened  had come up to the support of wellington picton was dead  at the very moment when the english had captured from the french the flag of the th of the line  the french had killed the english general  picton  with a bullet through the head  the battle had  for wellington  two bases of action  hougomont and la haie sainte hougomont still held out  but was on fire  la haie sainte was taken  of the german battalion which defended it  only forty two men survived  all the officers  except five  were either dead or captured  three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn  a sergeant of the english guards  the foremost boxer in england  reputed invulnerable by his companions  had been killed there by a little french drummer boy  baring had been dislodged  alten put to the sword  many flags had been lost one from alten s division  and one from the battalion of lunenburg carried by a prince of the house of deux ponts  the scotch grays no longer existed  ponsonby s great dragoons had been hacked to pieces that valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of bro and beneath the cuirassiers of travers  out of twelve hundred horses  six hundred remained  out of three lieutenant colonels  two lay on the earth hamilton wounded  mater slain  ponsonby had fallen  riddled by seven lance thrusts  gordon was dead  marsh was dead  two divisions  the fifth and the sixth  had been annihilated hougomont injured  la haie sainte taken  there now existed but one rallying point  the centre  that point still held firm  wellington reinforced it  he summoned thither hill  who was at merle braine  he summoned chasse  who was at braine l alleud the centre of the english army  rather concave  very dense  and very compact  was strongly posted  it occupied the plateau of mont saint jean  having behind it the village  and in front of it the slope  which was tolerably steep then  it rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of nivelles  and which marks the intersection of the roads a pile of the sixteenth century  and so robust that the cannon balls rebounded from it without injuring it  all about the plateau the english had cut the hedges here and there  made embrasures in the hawthorn trees  thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches  embattled the shrubs  there artillery was ambushed in the brushwood  this punic labor  incontestably authorized by war  which permits traps  was so well done  that haxo  who had been despatched by the emperor at nine o clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy s batteries  had discovered nothing of it  and had returned and reported to napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road to nivelles and to genappe  it was at the season when the grain is tall  on the edge of the plateau a battalion of kempt s brigade  the th  armed with carabines  was concealed in the tall wheat thus assured and buttressed  the centre of the anglo dutch army was well posted  the peril of this position lay in the forest of soignes then adjoining the field of battle  and intersected by the ponds of groenendael and boitsfort  an army could not retreat thither without dissolving  the regiments would have broken up immediately there the artillery would have been lost among the morasses  the retreat according to many a man versed in the art though it is disputed by others would have been a disorganized flight to this centre  wellington added one of chasse s brigades taken from the right wing  and one of wincke s brigades taken from the left wing  plus clinton s division  to his english  to the regiments of halkett  to the brigades of mitchell  to the guards of maitland  he gave as reinforcements and aids  the infantry of brunswick  nassau s contingent kielmansegg s hanoverians  and ompteda s germans  this placed twenty six battalions under his hand  the right wing  as charras says  was thrown back on the centre  an enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the museum of waterloo besides this  wellington had  behind a rise in the ground  somerset s dragoon guards  fourteen hundred horse strong  it was the remaining half of the justly celebrated english cavalry  ponsonby destroyed  somerset remained the battery  which  if completed  would have been almost a redoubt  was ranged behind a very low garden wall  backed up with a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth  this work was not finished  there had been no time to make a palisade for it wellington  uneasy but impassive  was on horseback  and there remained the whole day in the same attitude  a little in advance of the old mill of mont saint jean  which is still in existence  beneath an elm  which an englishman  an enthusiastic vandal  purchased later on for two hundred francs  cut down  and carried off  wellington was coldly heroic the bullets rained about him  his aide de camp  gordon  fell at his side  lord hill  pointing to a shell which had burst  said to him  my lord  what are your orders in case you are killed  to do like me replied wellington  to clinton he said laconically  to hold this spot to the last man  the day was evidently turning out ill  wellington shouted to his old companions of talavera  of vittoria  of salamanca boys  can retreat be thought of  think of old england towards four o clock  the english line drew back  suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters  the rest had disappeared  the regiments  dislodged by the shells and the french bullets  retreated into the bottom  now intersected by the back road of the farm of mont saint jean  a retrograde movement took place  the english front hid itself  wellington drew back  the beginning of retreat  cried napoleon chapter vii napoleon in a good humor the emperor  though ill and discommoded on horseback by a local trouble had never been in a better humor than on that day  his impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning  on the th of june  that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly  the man who had been gloomy at austerlitz was gay at waterloo  the greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes  our joys are composed of shadow  the supreme smile is god s alone ridet caesar  pompeius flebit  said the legionaries of the fulminatrix legion  pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion  but it is certain that caesar laughed  while exploring on horseback at one o clock on the preceding night  in storm and rain  in company with bertrand  the communes in the neighborhood of rossomme  satisfied at the sight of the long line of the english camp fires illuminating the whole horizon from frischemont to braine l alleud  it had seemed to him that fate  to whom he had assigned a day on the field of waterloo  was exact to the appointment  he stopped his horse  and remained for some time motionless  gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder and this fatalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying  we are in accord  napoleon was mistaken  they were no longer in accord he took not a moment for sleep  every instant of that night was marked by a joy for him  he traversed the line of the principal outposts halting here and there to talk to the sentinels  at half past two  near the wood of hougomont  he heard the tread of a column on the march  he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of wellington he said  it is the rear guard of the english getting under way for the purpose of decamping  i will take prisoners the six thousand english who have just arrived at ostend  he conversed expansively  he regained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of march  when he pointed out to the grand marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the gulf juan  and cried  well  bertrand  here is a reinforcement already  on the night of the th to the th of june he rallied wellington  that little englishman needs a lesson  said napoleon  the rain redoubled in violence  the thunder rolled while the emperor was speaking at half past three o clock in the morning  he lost one illusion officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement  nothing was stirring  not a bivouac fire had been extinguished  the english army was asleep  the silence on earth was profound  the only noise was in the heavens at four o clock  a peasant was brought in to him by the scouts  this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of english cavalry  probably vivian s brigade  which was on its way to take up a position in the village of ohain  at the extreme left  at five o clock  two belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment and that the english army was ready for battle  so much the better exclaimed napoleon  i prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back in the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an angle with the plancenoit road  had a kitchen table and a peasant s chair brought to him from the farm of rossomme  seated himself  with a truss of straw for a carpet  and spread out on the table the chart of the battle field  saying to soult as he did so  a pretty checker board in consequence of the rains during the night  the transports of provisions  embedded in the soft roads  had not been able to arrive by morning  the soldiers had had no sleep  they were wet and fasting  this did not prevent napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to ney  we have ninety chances out of a hundred  at eight o clock the emperor s breakfast was brought to him  he invited many generals to it  during breakfast  it was said that wellington had been to a ball two nights before  in brussels  at the duchess of richmond s  and soult  a rough man of war  with a face of an archbishop  said  the ball takes place to day  the emperor jested with ney  who said  wellington will not be so simple as to wait for your majesty  that was his way  however  he was fond of jesting  says fleury de chaboulon  a merry humor was at the foundation of his character  says gourgaud  he abounded in pleasantries  which were more peculiar than witty  says benjamin constant  these gayeties of a giant are worthy of insistence  it was he who called his grenadiers his grumblers  he pinched their ears  he pulled their mustaches  the emperor did nothing but play pranks on us is the remark of one of them  during the mysterious trip from the island of elba to france  on the th of february  on the open sea  the french brig of war  le zephyr  having encountered the brig l inconstant  on which napoleon was concealed  and having asked the news of napoleon from l inconstant  the emperor  who still wore in his hat the white and amaranthine cockade sown with bees  which he had adopted at the isle of elba  laughingly seized the speaking trumpet  and answered for himself the emperor is well  a man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events  napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast at waterloo  after breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour  then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw  pen in hand and their paper on their knees  and the emperor dictated to them the order of battle at nine o clock  at the instant when the french army  ranged in echelons and set in motion in five columns  had deployed the divisions in two lines  the artillery between the brigades  the music at their head  as they beat the march  with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets mighty  vast  joyous  a sea of casques  of sabres  and of bayonets on the horizon  the emperor was touched  and twice exclaimed  magnificent magnificent between nine o clock and half past ten the whole army  incredible as it may appear  had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines forming  to repeat the emperor s expression  the figure of six v s a few moments after the formation of the battle array  in the midst of that profound silence  like that which heralds the beginning of a storm which precedes engagements  the emperor tapped haxo on the shoulder  as he beheld the three batteries of twelve pounders  detached by his orders from the corps of erlon  reille  and lobau  and destined to begin the action by taking mont saint jean  which was situated at the intersection of the nivelles and the genappe roads  and said to him  there are four and twenty handsome maids  general sure of the issue  he encouraged with a smile  as they passed before him  the company of sappers of the first corps  which he had appointed to barricade mont saint jean as soon as the village should be carried all this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of haughty pity  perceiving on his left  at a spot where there now stands a large tomb  those admirable scotch grays  with their superb horses  massing themselves  he said  it is a pity then he mounted his horse  advanced beyond rossomme  and selected for his post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from genappe to brussels  which was his second station during the battle  the third station  the one adopted at seven o clock in the evening  between la belle alliance and la haie sainte  is formidable it is a rather elevated knoll  which still exists  and behind which the guard was massed on a slope of the plain  around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road  up to napoleon himself  as at brienne  he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery  mouldy cannon balls  old sword blades  and shapeless projectiles  eaten up with rust  were picked up at the spot where his horse  feet stood  scabra rubigine  a few years ago  a shell of sixty pounds  still charged  and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb was unearthed  it was at this last post that the emperor said to his guide  lacoste  a hostile and terrified peasant  who was attached to the saddle of a hussar  and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind napoleon  fool  it is shameful  you ll get yourself killed with a ball in the back  he who writes these lines has himself found  in the friable soil of this knoll  on turning over the sand  the remains of the neck of a bomb  disintegrated  by the oxidization of six and forty years  and old fragments of iron which parted like elder twigs between the fingers every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains  where the engagement between napoleon and wellington took place are no longer what they were on june   by taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it  its real relief has been taken away  and history  disconcerted  no longer finds her bearings there  it has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it  wellington  when he beheld waterloo once more  two years later exclaimed  they have altered my field of battle  where the great pyramid of earth  surmounted by the lion  rises to day  there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the nivelles road  but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to genappe the elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from genappe to brussels  one  the english tomb  is on the left  the other the german tomb  is on the right  there is no french tomb  the whole of that plain is a sepulchre for france  thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cartloads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference  the plateau of mont saint jean is now accessible by an easy slope  on the day of battle  particularly on the side of la haie sainte  it was abrupt and difficult of approach  the slope there is so steep that the english cannon could not see the farm  situated in the bottom of the valley which was the centre of the combat  on the th of june   the rains had still farther increased this acclivity  the mud complicated the problem of the ascent  and the men not only slipped back  but stuck fast in the mire  along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine what was this trench  let us explain  braine l alleud is a belgian village  ohain is another  these villages  both of them concealed in curves of the landscape  are connected by a road about a league and a half in length  which traverses the plain along its undulating level and often enters and buries itself in the hills like a furrow  which makes a ravine of this road in some places  in  as at the present day  this road cut the crest of the plateau of mont saint jean between the two highways from genappe and nivelles  only  it is now on a level with the plain  it was then a hollow way  its two slopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock  this road was  and still is a trench throughout the greater portion of its course  a hollow trench sometimes a dozen feet in depth  and whose banks  being too steep crumbled away here and there  particularly in winter  under driving rains  accidents happened here  the road was so narrow at the braine l alleud entrance that a passer by was crushed by a cart  as is proved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery  and which gives the name of the dead  monsieur bernard debrye  merchant of brussels and the date of the accident  february   it was so deep on the table land of mont saint jean that a peasant  mathieu nicaise was crushed there  in  by a slide from the slope  as is stated on another stone cross  the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground  but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the highway between la haie sainte and the farm of mont saint jean on the day of battle  this hollow road whose existence was in no way indicated  bordering the crest of mont saint jean  a trench at the summit of the escarpment  a rut concealed in the soil  was invisible that is to say  terrible chapter viii the emperor puts a question to the guide lacoste so  on the morning of waterloo  napoleon was content he was right  the plan of battle conceived by him was  as we have seen really admirable the battle once begun  its very various changes the resistance of hougomont  the tenacity of la haie sainte  the killing of bauduin  the disabling of foy  the unexpected wall against which soye s brigade was shattered  guilleminot s fatal heedlessness when he had neither petard nor powder sacks  the miring of the batteries  the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by uxbridge  the small effect of the bombs falling in the english lines  and there embedding themselves in the rain soaked soil  and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud so that the canister was turned into a splash  the uselessness of pire s demonstration on braine l alleud  all that cavalry  fifteen squadrons almost exterminated  the right wing of the english badly alarmed  the left wing badly cut into  ney s strange mistake in massing  instead of echelonning the four divisions of the first corps  men delivered over to grape shot  arranged in ranks twenty seven deep and with a frontage of two hundred  the frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon balls  attacking columns disorganized  the side battery suddenly unmasked on their flank  bourgeois  donzelot  and durutte compromised quiot repulsed  lieutenant vieux  that hercules graduated at the polytechnic school  wounded at the moment when he was beating in with an axe the door of la haie sainte under the downright fire of the english barricade which barred the angle of the road from genappe to brussels marcognet s division caught between the infantry and the cavalry  shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by best and pack  put to the sword by ponsonby  his battery of seven pieces spiked  the prince of saxe weimar holding and guarding  in spite of the comte d erlon  both frischemont and smohain  the flag of the th taken  the flag of the th captured  that black prussian hussar stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between wavre and plancenoit  the alarming things that had been said by prisoners grouchy s delay  fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard of hougomont in less than an hour  eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about la haie sainte all these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of battle before napoleon  had hardly troubled his gaze and had not overshadowed that face of imperial certainty  napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war  he never added up the heart rending details  cipher by cipher  ciphers mattered little to him  provided that they furnished the total  victory  he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray  since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end  he knew how to wait  supposing himself to be out of the question  and he treated destiny as his equal  he seemed to say to fate thou wilt not dare composed half of light and half of shadow  napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil  he had  or thought that he had a connivance  one might almost say a complicity  of events in his favor which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity nevertheless  when one has beresina  leipzig  and fontainebleau behind one  it seems as though one might distrust waterloo  a mysterious frown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens at the moment when wellington retreated  napoleon shuddered  he suddenly beheld the table land of mont saint jean cleared  and the van of the english army disappear  it was rallying  but hiding itself  the emperor half rose in his stirrups  the lightning of victory flashed from his eyes wellington  driven into a corner at the forest of soignes and destroyed that was the definitive conquest of england by france  it was crecy  poitiers  malplaquet  and ramillies avenged  the man of marengo was wiping out agincourt so the emperor  meditating on this terrible turn of fortune  swept his glass for the last time over all the points of the field of battle  his guard  standing behind him with grounded arms  watched him from below with a sort of religion  he pondered  he examined the slopes  noted the declivities  scrutinized the clumps of trees  the square of rye  the path  he seemed to be counting each bush  he gazed with some intentness at the english barricades of the two highways two large abatis of trees  that on the road to genappe above la haie sainte  armed with two cannon  the only ones out of all the english artillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle  and that on the road to nivelles where gleamed the dutch bayonets of chasse s brigade  near this barricade he observed the old chapel of saint nicholas  painted white which stands at the angle of the cross road near braine l alleud  he bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide lacoste  the guide made a negative sign with his head  which was probably perfidious the emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking wellington had drawn back all that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him napoleon turning round abruptly  despatched an express at full speed to paris to announce that the battle was won napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts he had just found his clap of thunder he gave orders to milhaud s cuirassiers to carry the table land of mont saint jean chapter ix the unexpected there were three thousand five hundred of them  they formed a front a quarter of a league in extent  they were giant men  on colossal horses there were six and twenty squadrons of them  and they had behind them to support them lefebvre desnouettes s division the one hundred and six picked gendarmes  the light cavalry of the guard  eleven hundred and ninety seven men  and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and eighty lances  they wore casques without horse tails  and cuirasses of beaten iron  with horse pistols in their holsters  and long sabre swords  that morning the whole army had admired them  when  at nine o clock  with braying of trumpets and all the music playing let us watch o er the safety of the empire  they had come in a solid column with one of their batteries on their flank  another in their centre  and deployed in two ranks between the roads to genappe and frischemont and taken up their position for battle in that powerful second line so cleverly arranged by napoleon  which  having on its extreme left kellermann s cuirassiers and on its extreme right milhaud s cuirassiers had  so to speak  two wings of iron aide de camp bernard carried them the emperor s orders  ney drew his sword and placed himself at their head  the enormous squadrons were set in motion then a formidable spectacle was seen all their cavalry  with upraised swords  standards and trumpets flung to the breeze  formed in columns by divisions  descended  by a simultaneous movement and like one man  with the precision of a brazen battering ram which is effecting a breach  the hill of la belle alliance  plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen  disappeared there in the smoke  then emerging from that shadow  reappeared on the other side of the valley  still compact and in close ranks  mounting at a full trot  through a storm of grape shot which burst upon them the terrible muddy slope of the table land of mont saint jean  they ascended  grave  threatening  imperturbable  in the intervals between the musketry and the artillery  their colossal trampling was audible being two divisions  there were two columns of them  wathier s division held the right  delort s division was on the left  it seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the table land  it traversed the battle like a prodigy nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of the muskowa by the heavy cavalry  murat was lacking here  but ney was again present  it seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul  each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp  they could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there  a confusion of helmets  of cries  of sabres  a stormy heaving of the cruppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of trumpets  a terrible and disciplined tumult  over all  the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra these narrations seemed to belong to another age  something parallel to this vision appeared  no doubt  in the ancient orphic epics  which told of the centaurs  the old hippanthropes  those titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled olympus at a gallop  horrible invulnerable  sublime gods and beasts odd numerical coincidence twenty six battalions rode to meet twenty six battalions  behind the crest of the plateau  in the shadow of the masked battery  the english infantry  formed into thirteen squares two battalions to the square  in two lines  with seven in the first line  six in the second  the stocks of their guns to their shoulders taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing  waited  calm mute  motionless  they did not see the cuirassiers  and the cuirassiers did not see them  they listened to the rise of this flood of men  they heard the swelling noise of three thousand horse  the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their hoofs at full trot  the jingling of the cuirasses  the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing  there ensued a most terrible silence  then  all at once a long file of uplifted arms  brandishing sabres  appeared above the crest  and casques  trumpets  and standards  and three thousand heads with gray mustaches  shouting  vive l empereur  all this cavalry debouched on the plateau  and it was like the appearance of an earthquake all at once  a tragic incident  on the english left  on our right  the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor  on arriving at the culminating point of the crest  ungovernable  utterly given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and cannon  the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench a trench between them and the english  it was the hollow road of ohain it was a terrible moment  the ravine was there  unexpected  yawning directly under the horses  feet  two fathoms deep between its double slopes  the second file pushed the first into it  and the third pushed on the second  the horses reared and fell backward  landed on their haunches  slid down  all four feet in the air  crushing and overwhelming the riders  and there being no means of retreat the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile the force which had been acquired to crush the english crushed the french  the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled  horses and riders rolled there pell mell grinding each other  forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf  when this trench was full of living men  the rest marched over them and passed on  almost a third of dubois s brigade fell into that abyss this began the loss of the battle a local tradition  which evidently exaggerates matters  says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road of ohain  this figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat let us note in passing that it was dubois s sorely tried brigade which an hour previously  making a charge to one side  had captured the flag of the lunenburg battalion napoleon  before giving the order for this charge of milhaud s cuirassiers  had scrutinized the ground  but had not been able to see that hollow road  which did not even form a wrinkle on the surface of the plateau  warned  nevertheless  and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the nivelles highway  he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle  to the guide lacoste  the guide had answered no  we might almost affirm that napoleon s catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant s head other fatalities were destined to arise was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle  we answer no why  because of wellington  because of blucher  no  because of god bonaparte victor at waterloo  that does not come within the law of the nineteenth century  another series of facts was in preparation  in which there was no longer any room for napoleon  the ill will of events had declared itself long before it was time that this vast man should fall the excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance this individual alone counted for more than a universal group  these plethoras of all human vitality concentrated in a single head  the world mounting to the brain of one man this would be mortal to civilization were it to last  the moment had arrived for the incorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan  probably the principles and the elements  on which the regular gravitations of the moral  as of the material  world depend  had complained  smoking blood  over filled cemeteries  mothers in tears these are formidable pleaders  when the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden  there are mysterious groanings of the shades  to which the abyss lends an ear napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decided on he embarrassed god waterloo is not a battle  it is a change of front on the part of the universe chapter x the plateau of mont saint jean the battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point blank on the cuirassiers  the intrepid general delort made the military salute to the english battery the whole of the flying artillery of the english had re entered the squares at a gallop  the cuirassiers had not had even the time for a halt  the disaster of the hollow road had decimated  but not discouraged them  they belonged to that class of men who  when diminished in number increase in courage wathier s column alone had suffered in the disaster  delort s column which ney had deflected to the left  as though he had a presentiment of an ambush  had arrived whole the cuirassiers hurled themselves on the english squares at full speed  with bridles loose  swords in their teeth pistols in fist such was the attack there are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until the soldier is changed into a statue  and when all this flesh turns into granite  the english battalions  desperately assaulted  did not stir then it was terrible all the faces of the english squares were attacked at once  a frenzied whirl enveloped them  that cold infantry remained impassive  the first rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets  the second ranks shot them down  behind the second rank the cannoneers charged their guns  the front of the square parted  permitted the passage of an eruption of grape shot  and closed again  the cuirassiers replied by crushing them  their great horses reared  strode across the ranks leaped over the bayonets and fell  gigantic  in the midst of these four living wells  the cannon balls ploughed furrows in these cuirassiers the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares  files of men disappeared ground to dust under the horses  the bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs  hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else  the squares  wasted by this mad cavalry closed up their ranks without flinching  inexhaustible in the matter of grape shot  they created explosions in their assailants  midst  the form of this combat was monstrous  these squares were no longer battalions they were craters  those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry  they were a tempest  each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud  lava contended with lightning the square on the extreme right  the most exposed of all  being in the air  was almost annihilated at the very first shock  lt was formed of the th regiment of highlanders  the bagpipe player in the centre dropped his melancholy eyes  filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes  in profound inattention  while men were being exterminated around him  and seated on a drum  with his pibroch under his arm  played the highland airs  these scotchmen died thinking of ben lothian  as did the greeks recalling argos  the sword of a cuirassier which hewed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it  put an end to the song by killing the singer the cuirassiers  relatively few in number  and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine  had almost the whole english army against them  but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten  nevertheless  some hanoverian battalions yielded wellington perceived it  and thought of his cavalry  had napoleon at that same moment thought of his infantry  he would have won the battle this forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake all at once  the cuirassiers  who had been the assailants  found themselves assailed  the english cavalry was at their back  before them two squares  behind them somerset  somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard  on the right  somerset had dornberg with the german light horse  and on his left  trip with the belgian carabineers the cuirassiers attacked on the flank and in front  before and in the rear  by infantry and cavalry  had to face all sides  what mattered it to them  they were a whirlwind  their valor was something indescribable in addition to this  they had behind them the battery  which was still thundering  it was necessary that it should be so  or they could never have been wounded in the back  one of their cuirasses  pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a biscayan  is in the collection of the waterloo museum for such frenchmen nothing less than such englishmen was needed  it was no longer a hand to hand conflict  it was a shadow  a fury  a dizzy transport of souls and courage  a hurricane of lightning swords  in an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred fuller  their lieutenant colonel  fell dead  ney rushed up with the lancers and lefebvre desnouettes s light horse  the plateau of mont saint jean was captured  recaptured  captured again  the cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry  or  to put it more exactly  the whole of that formidable rout collared each other without releasing the other  the squares still held firm there were a dozen assaults  ney had four horses killed under him  half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau  this conflict lasted two hours the english army was profoundly shaken  there is no doubt that  had they not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory  this extraordinary cavalry petrified clinton  who had seen talavera and badajoz  wellington  three quarters vanquished  admired heroically  he said in an undertone  sublime the cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen  took or spiked sixty pieces of ordnance  and captured from the english regiments six flags  which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the guard bore to the emperor  in front of the farm of la belle alliance wellington s situation had grown worse  this strange battle was like a duel between two raging  wounded men  each of whom  still fighting and still resisting  is expending all his blood which of the two will be the first to fall the conflict on the plateau continued what had become of the cuirassiers  no one could have told  one thing is certain  that on the day after the battle  a cuirassier and his horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at mont saint jean  at the very point where the four roads from nivelles genappe  la hulpe  and brussels meet and intersect each other  this horseman had pierced the english lines  one of the men who picked up the body still lives at mont saint jean  his name is dehaze  he was eighteen years old at that time wellington felt that he was yielding  the crisis was at hand the cuirassiers had not succeeded  since the centre was not broken through  as every one was in possession of the plateau  no one held it and in fact it remained  to a great extent  with the english  wellington held the village and the culminating plain  ney had only the crest and the slope  they seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides but the weakening of the english seemed irremediable  the bleeding of that army was horrible  kempt  on the left wing  demanded reinforcements  there are none  replied wellington  he must let himself be killed  almost at that same moment  a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies  ney demanded infantry from napoleon  and napoleon exclaimed  infantry  where does he expect me to get it  does he think i can make it nevertheless  the english army was in the worse case of the two  the furious onsets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing  a few men clustered round a flag marked the post of a regiment  such and such a battalion was commanded only by a captain or a lieutenant  alten s division already so roughly handled at la haie sainte  was almost destroyed the intrepid belgians of van kluze s brigade strewed the rye fields all along the nivelles road  hardly anything was left of those dutch grenadiers  who  intermingled with spaniards in our ranks in fought against wellington  and who  in  rallied to the english standard  fought against napoleon  the loss in officers was considerable  lord uxbridge  who had his leg buried on the following day  had his knee shattered  if  on the french side  in that tussle of the cuirassiers  delort  l heritier  colbert  dnop  travers  and blancard were disabled  on the side of the english there was alten wounded  barne wounded  delancey killed  van meeren killed  ompteda killed  the whole of wellington s staff decimated  and england had the worse of it in that bloody scale  the second regiment of foot guards had lost five lieutenant colonels  four captains  and three ensigns the first battalion of the th infantry had lost  officers and soldiers  the th highlanders had lost  officers wounded   officers killed   soldiers killed  the hanoverian hussars of cumberland  a whole regiment  with colonel hacke at its head  who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered  had turned bridle in the presence of the fray  and had fled to the forest of soignes  sowing defeat all the way to brussels  the transports  ammunition wagons  the baggage wagons  the wagons filled with wounded  on perceiving that the french were gaining ground and approaching the forest  rushed headlong thither  the dutch mowed down by the french cavalry  cried  alarm  from vert coucou to groentendael  for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of brussels  according to the testimony of eye witnesses who are still alive  the roads were encumbered with fugitives  this panic was such that it attacked the prince de conde at mechlin  and louis xviii  at ghent  with the exception of the feeble reserve echelonned behind the ambulance established at the farm of mont saint jean  and of vivian s and vandeleur s brigades  which flanked the left wing  wellington had no cavalry left  a number of batteries lay unhorsed  these facts are attested by siborne  and pringle  exaggerating the disaster  goes so far as to say that the anglo dutch army was reduced to thirty four thousand men  the iron duke remained calm  but his lips blanched  vincent  the austrian commissioner  alava  the spanish commissioner  who were present at the battle in the english staff  thought the duke lost  at five o clock wellington drew out his watch  and he was heard to murmur these sinister words  blucher  or night it was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed on the heights in the direction of frischemont here comes the change of face in this giant drama chapter xi a bad guide to napoleon  a good guide to bulow the painful surprise of napoleon is well known  grouchy hoped for blucher arriving  death instead of life fate has these turns  the throne of the world was expected  it was saint helena that was seen if the little shepherd who served as guide to bulow  blucher s lieutenant  had advised him to debouch from the forest above frischemont  instead of below plancenoit  the form of the nineteenth century might  perhaps  have been different  napoleon would have won the battle of waterloo  by any other route than that below plancenoit the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery  and bulow would not have arrived now the prussian general  muffling  declares that one hour s delay  and blucher would not have found wellington on his feet  the battle was lost it was time that bulow should arrive  as will be seen  he had  moreover been very much delayed  he had bivouacked at dion le mont  and had set out at daybreak  but the roads were impassable  and his divisions stuck fast in the mire  the ruts were up to the hubs of the cannons  moreover he had been obliged to pass the dyle on the narrow bridge of wavre the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the french  so the caissons and ammunition wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses  and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished  it was mid day before bulow s vanguard had been able to reach chapelle saint lambert had the action been begun two hours earlier  it would have been over at four o clock  and blucher would have fallen on the battle won by napoleon  such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we cannot comprehend the emperor had been the first  as early as mid day  to descry with his field glass  on the extreme horizon  something which had attracted his attention  he had said  i see yonder a cloud  which seems to me to be troops  then he asked the duc de dalmatie  soult  what do you see in the direction of chapelle saint lambert  the marshal  levelling his glass  answered  four or five thousand men  sire  evidently grouchy but it remained motionless in the mist  all the glasses of the staff had studied the cloud  pointed out by the emperor  some said  it is trees  the truth is  that the cloud did not move  the emperor detached domon s division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter bulow had not moved  in fact  his vanguard was very feeble  and could accomplish nothing  he was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps  and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering into line  but at five o clock  perceiving wellington s peril blucher ordered bulow to attack  and uttered these remarkable words  we must give air to the english army a little later  the divisions of losthin  hiller  hacke  and ryssel deployed before lobau s corps  the cavalry of prince william of prussia debouched from the forest of paris  plancenoit was in flames  and the prussian cannon balls began to rain even upon the ranks of the guard in reserve behind napoleon chapter xii the guard every one knows the rest the irruption of a third army  the battle broken to pieces  eighty six mouths of fire thundering simultaneously pirch the first coming up with bulow  zieten s cavalry led by blucher in person  the french driven back  marcognet swept from the plateau of ohain  durutte dislodged from papelotte  donzelot and quiot retreating lobau caught on the flank  a fresh battle precipitating itself on our dismantled regiments at nightfall  the whole english line resuming the offensive and thrust forward  the gigantic breach made in the french army  the english grape shot and the prussian grape shot aiding each other  the extermination  disaster in front  disaster on the flank  the guard entering the line in the midst of this terrible crumbling of all things conscious that they were about to die  they shouted  vive l empereur history records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in acclamations the sky had been overcast all day long  all of a sudden  at that very moment it was eight o clock in the evening the clouds on the horizon parted  and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to pass through  athwart the elms on the nivelles road  they had seen it rise at austerlitz each battalion of the guard was commanded by a general for this final catastrophe  friant  michel  roguet  harlet  mallet  poret de morvan were there  when the tall caps of the grenadiers of the guard  with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared  symmetrical  in line tranquil  in the midst of that combat  the enemy felt a respect for france  they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle  with wings outspread  and those who were the conquerors believing themselves to be vanquished  retreated  but wellington shouted  up  guards  and aim straight  the red regiment of english guards  lying flat behind the hedges  sprang up  a cloud of grape shot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles  all hurled themselves forwards  and the final carnage began  in the darkness  the imperial guard felt the army losing ground around it  and in the vast shock of the rout it heard the desperate flight which had taken the place of the vive l empereur  and  with flight behind it  it continued to advance  more crushed  losing more men at every step that it took there were none who hesitated  no timid men in its ranks  the soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general  not a man was missing in that suicide ney  bewildered  great with all the grandeur of accepted death  offered himself to all blows in that tempest  he had his fifth horse killed under him there  perspiring  his eyes aflame  foaming at the mouth  with uniform unbuttoned  one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword stroke from a horseguard  his plaque with the great eagle dented by a bullet bleeding  bemired  magnificent  a broken sword in his hand  he said come and see how a marshal of france dies on the field of battle  but in vain  he did not die  he was haggard and angry  at drouet d erlon he hurled this question  are you not going to get yourself killed  in the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men he shouted  so there is nothing for me  oh  i should like to have all these english bullets enter my bowels  unhappy man  thou wert reserved for french bullets chapter xiii the catastrophe the rout behind the guard was melancholy the army yielded suddenly on all sides at once hougomont  la haie sainte  papelotte  plancenoit  the cry treachery  was followed by a cry of save yourselves who can  an army which is disbanding is like a thaw  all yields  splits  cracks  floats  rolls  falls  jostles hastens  is precipitated  the disintegration is unprecedented  ney borrows a horse  leaps upon it  and without hat  cravat  or sword places himself across the brussels road  stopping both english and french  he strives to detain the army  he recalls it to its duty  he insults it  he clings to the rout  he is overwhelmed  the soldiers fly from him  shouting  long live marshal ney  two of durutte s regiments go and come in affright as though tossed back and forth between the swords of the uhlans and the fusillade of the brigades of kempt  best pack  and rylandt  the worst of hand to hand conflicts is the defeat friends kill each other in order to escape  squadrons and battalions break and disperse against each other  like the tremendous foam of battle  lobau at one extremity  and reille at the other  are drawn into the tide  in vain does napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his guard  in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons  quiot retreats before vivian  kellermann before vandeleur lobau before bulow  morand before pirch  domon and subervic before prince william of prussia  guyot  who led the emperor s squadrons to the charge  falls beneath the feet of the english dragoons  napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives  harangues  urges  threatens  entreats them  all the mouths which in the morning had shouted  long live the emperor  remain gaping  they hardly recognize him  the prussian cavalry  newly arrived  dashes forwards  flies  hews  slashes  kills exterminates  horses lash out  the cannons flee  the soldiers of the artillery train unharness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape  transports overturned  with all four wheels in the air  clog the road and occasion massacres  men are crushed  trampled down  others walk over the dead and the living  arms are lost  a dizzy multitude fills the roads  the paths  the bridges  the plains  the hills  the valleys the woods  encumbered by this invasion of forty thousand men  shouts despair  knapsacks and guns flung among the rye  passages forced at the point of the sword  no more comrades  no more officers  no more generals  an inexpressible terror  zieten putting france to the sword at its leisure  lions converted into goats  such was the flight at genappe  an effort was made to wheel about  to present a battle front  to draw up in line  lobau rallied three hundred men  the entrance to the village was barricaded  but at the first volley of prussian canister  all took to flight again  and lobau was taken  that volley of grape shot can be seen to day imprinted on the ancient gable of a brick building on the right of the road at a few minutes  distance before you enter genappe  the prussians threw themselves into genappe  furious  no doubt  that they were not more entirely the conquerors  the pursuit was stupendous  blucher ordered extermination  roguet had set the lugubrious example of threatening with death any french grenadier who should bring him a prussian prisoner  blucher outdid roguet  duhesme  the general of the young guard  hemmed in at the doorway of an inn at genappe surrendered his sword to a huzzar of death  who took the sword and slew the prisoner  the victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished  let us inflict punishment  since we are history  old blucher disgraced himself  this ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster  the desperate route traversed genappe  traversed quatre bras traversed gosselies  traversed frasnes  traversed charleroi  traversed thuin  and only halted at the frontier  alas  and who  then  was fleeing in that manner  the grand army this vertigo  this terror  this downfall into ruin of the loftiest bravery which ever astounded history is that causeless  no  the shadow of an enormous right is projected athwart waterloo  it is the day of destiny  the force which is mightier than man produced that day  hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows  hence all those great souls surrendering their swords  those who had conquered europe have fallen prone on the earth  with nothing left to say nor to do  feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence  hoc erat in fatis  that day the perspective of the human race underwent a change  waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century  the disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent of the great century  some one  a person to whom one replies not  took the responsibility on himself  the panic of heroes can be explained  in the battle of waterloo there is something more than a cloud  there is something of the meteor  god has passed by at nightfall  in a meadow near genappe  bernard and bertrand seized by the skirt of his coat and detained a man  haggard  pensive  sinister gloomy  who  dragged to that point by the current of the rout  had just dismounted  had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm  and with wild eye was returning alone to waterloo  it was napoleon  the immense somnambulist of this dream which had crumbled  essaying once more to advance chapter xiv the last square several squares of the guard  motionless amid this stream of the defeat as rocks in running water  held their own until night  night came death also  they awaited that double shadow  and  invincible  allowed themselves to be enveloped therein  each regiment  isolated from the rest  and having no bond with the army  now shattered in every part died alone  they had taken up position for this final action  some on the heights of rossomme  others on the plain of mont saint jean  there abandoned  vanquished  terrible  those gloomy squares endured their death throes in formidable fashion  ulm  wagram  jena  friedland  died with them at twilight  towards nine o clock in the evening  one of them was left at the foot of the plateau of mont saint jean  in that fatal valley at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended  now inundated by the masses of the english  under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry  under a frightful density of projectiles  this square fought on  it was commanded by an obscure officer named cambronne  at each discharge  the square diminished and replied  it replied to the grape shot with a fusillade  continually contracting its four walls  the fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance  listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever decreasing thunder when this legion had been reduced to a handful  when nothing was left of their flag but a rag  when their guns  the bullets all gone  were no longer anything but clubs  when the heap of corpses was larger than the group of survivors  there reigned among the conquerors  around those men dying so sublimely  a sort of sacred terror  and the english artillery taking breath  became silent  this furnished a sort of respite  these combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres  silhouettes of men on horseback  the black profiles of cannon the white sky viewed through wheels and gun carriages  the colossal death s head  which the heroes saw constantly through the smoke  in the depths of the battle  advanced upon them and gazed at them  through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded  the matches all lighted  like the eyes of tigers at night  formed a circle round their heads  all the lintstocks of the english batteries approached the cannons  and then  with emotion  holding the supreme moment suspended above these men  an english general  colville according to some maitland according to others  shouted to them  surrender  brave frenchmen  cambronne replied  editor s commentary  another edition of this book has the word merde in lieu of the  above chapter xv cambronne if any french reader object to having his susceptibilities offended  one would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps the finest reply that a frenchman ever made  this would enjoin us from consigning something sublime to history at our own risk and peril  let us violate this injunction now  then  among those giants there was one titan cambronne to make that reply and then perish  what could be grander  for being willing to die is the same as to die  and it was not this man s fault if he survived after he was shot the winner of the battle of waterloo was not napoleon  who was put to flight  nor wellington  giving way at four o clock  in despair at five nor blucher  who took no part in the engagement  the winner of waterloo was cambronne to thunder forth such a reply at the lightning flash that kills you is to conquer thus to answer the catastrophe  thus to speak to fate  to give this pedestal to the future lion  to hurl such a challenge to the midnight rainstorm  to the treacherous wall of hougomont  to the sunken road of ohain  to grouchy s delay  to blucher s arrival  to be irony itself in the tomb  to act so as to stand upright though fallen  to drown in two syllables the european coalition  to offer kings privies which the caesars once knew  to make the lowest of words the most lofty by entwining with it the glory of france  insolently to end waterloo with mardigras  to finish leonidas with rabellais  to set the crown on this victory by a word impossible to speak  to lose the field and preserve history  to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage this is immense it was an insult such as a thunder cloud might hurl  it reaches the grandeur of aeschylus cambronne s reply produces the effect of a violent break  tis like the breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn  tis the overflow of agony bursting forth  who conquered  wellington  no  had it not been for blucher  he was lost  was it blucher  no  if wellington had not begun blucher could not have finished  this cambronne  this man spending his last hour  this unknown soldier  this infinitesimal of war  realizes that here is a falsehood  a falsehood in a catastrophe  and so doubly agonizing  and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of it  he is offered this mockery life  how could he restrain himself yonder are all the kings of europe  the general s flushed with victory the jupiter s darting thunderbolts  they have a hundred thousand victorious soldiers  and back of the hundred thousand a million  their cannon stand with yawning mouths  the match is lighted  they grind down under their heels the imperial guards  and the grand army  they have just crushed napoleon  and only cambronne remains only this earthworm is left to protest  he will protest  then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword  his mouth froths  and the froth is the word  in face of this mean and mighty victory  in face of this victory which counts none victorious  this desperate soldier stands erect  he grants its overwhelming immensity  but he establishes its triviality and he does more than spit upon it  borne down by numbers  by superior force  by brute matter  he finds in his soul an expression  excrement we repeat it to use that word  to do thus  to invent such an expression  is to be the conqueror the spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent on that unknown man  cambronne invents the word for waterloo as rouget invents the marseillaise  under the visitation of a breath from on high  an emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes sweeping over these men  and they shake  and one of them sings the song supreme  and the other utters the frightful cry this challenge of titanic scorn cambronne hurls not only at europe in the name of the empire that would be a trifle  he hurls it at the past in the name of the revolution  it is heard  and cambronne is recognized as possessed by the ancient spirit of the titans  danton seems to be speaking  kleber seems to be bellowing at that word from cambronne  the english voice responded  fire the batteries flamed  the hill trembled  from all those brazen mouths belched a last terrible gush of grape shot  a vast volume of smoke vaguely white in the light of the rising moon  rolled out  and when the smoke dispersed  there was no longer anything there  that formidable remnant had been annihilated  the guard was dead  the four walls of the living redoubt lay prone  and hardly was there discernible  here and there  even a quiver in the bodies  it was thus that the french legions greater than the roman legions  expired on mont saint jean  on the soil watered with rain and blood  amid the gloomy grain  on the spot where nowadays joseph  who drives the post wagon from nivelles  passes whistling  and cheerfully whipping up his horse at four o clock in the morning chapter xvi quot libras in duce the battle of waterloo is an enigma  it is as obscure to those who won it as to those who lost it  for napoleon it was a panic  blucher sees nothing in it but fire  wellington understands nothing in regard to it  look at the reports  the bulletins are confused  the commentaries involved  some stammer  others lisp  jomini divides the battle of waterloo into four moments  muffling cuts it up into three changes charras alone  though we hold another judgment than his on some points seized with his haughty glance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance  all the other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled  and in this dazzled state they fumble about  it was a day of lightning brilliancy  in fact a crumbling of the military monarchy which  to the vast stupefaction of kings  drew all the kingdoms after it the fall of force  the defeat of war in this event  stamped with superhuman necessity  the part played by men amounts to nothing if we take waterloo from wellington and blucher  do we thereby deprive england and germany of anything  no  neither that illustrious england nor that august germany enter into the problem of waterloo  thank heaven  nations are great  independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword  neither england  nor germany  nor france is contained in a scabbard  at this epoch when waterloo is only a clashing of swords above blucher  germany has schiller  above wellington  england has byron  a vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century  and in that aurora england and germany have a magnificent radiance  they are majestic because they think  the elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them  it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident  the aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not waterloo as its source  it is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory  that is the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm  civilized people especially in our day  are neither elevated nor abased by the good or bad fortune of a captain  their specific gravity in the human species results from something more than a combat  their honor  thank god  their dignity  their intelligence  their genius  are not numbers which those gamblers  heroes and conquerors  can put in the lottery of battles often a battle is lost and progress is conquered  there is less glory and more liberty  the drum holds its peace  reason takes the word  it is a game in which he who loses wins  let us  therefore  speak of waterloo coldly from both sides  let us render to chance that which is due to chance  and to god that which is due to god  what is waterloo  a victory  no  the winning number in the lottery the quine  won by europe  paid by france it was not worth while to place a lion there waterloo  moreover  is the strangest encounter in history  napoleon and wellington  they are not enemies  they are opposites  never did god who is fond of antitheses  make a more striking contrast  a more extraordinary comparison  on one side  precision  foresight  geometry prudence  an assured retreat  reserves spared  with an obstinate coolness  an imperturbable method  strategy  which takes advantage of the ground  tactics  which preserve the equilibrium of battalions carnage  executed according to rule  war regulated  watch in hand nothing voluntarily left to chance  the ancient classic courage absolute regularity  on the other  intuition  divination  military oddity  superhuman instinct  a flaming glance  an indescribable something which gazes like an eagle  and which strikes like the lightning  a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity  all the mysteries of a profound soul  associated with destiny  the stream  the plain  the forest  the hill  summoned  and in a manner  forced to obey  the despot going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle  faith in a star mingled with strategic science  elevating but perturbing it wellington was the bareme of war  napoleon was its michael angelo  and on this occasion  genius was vanquished by calculation  on both sides some one was awaited  it was the exact calculator who succeeded napoleon was waiting for grouchy  he did not come  wellington expected blucher  he came wellington is classic war taking its revenge  bonaparte  at his dawning had encountered him in italy  and beaten him superbly  the old owl had fled before the young vulture  the old tactics had been not only struck as by lightning  but disgraced  who was that corsican of six and twenty what signified that splendid ignoramus  who  with everything against him  nothing in his favor  without provisions  without ammunition without cannon  without shoes  almost without an army  with a mere handful of men against masses  hurled himself on europe combined and absurdly won victories in the impossible  whence had issued that fulminating convict  who almost without taking breath  and with the same set of combatants in hand  pulverized  one after the other  the five armies of the emperor of germany  upsetting beaulieu on alvinzi  wurmser on beaulieu  melas on wurmser  mack on melas  who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary  the academical military school excommunicated him  and as it lost its footing  hence  the implacable rancor of the old caesarism against the new  of the regular sword against the flaming sword  and of the exchequer against genius  on the th of june   that rancor had the last word  and beneath lodi montebello  montenotte  mantua  arcola  it wrote  waterloo  a triumph of the mediocres which is sweet to the majority  destiny consented to this irony  in his decline  napoleon found wurmser  the younger  again in front of him in fact  to get wurmser  it sufficed to blanch the hair of wellington waterloo is a battle of the first order  won by a captain of the second that which must be admired in the battle of waterloo  is england  the english firmness  the english resolution  the english blood  the superb thing about england there  no offence to her  was herself  it was not her captain  it was her army wellington  oddly ungrateful  declares in a letter to lord bathurst that his army  the army which fought on the th of june   was a detestable army  what does that sombre intermingling of bones buried beneath the furrows of waterloo think of that england has been too modest in the matter of wellington  to make wellington so great is to belittle england  wellington is nothing but a hero like many another  those scotch grays  those horse guards  those regiments of maitland and of mitchell  that infantry of pack and kempt that cavalry of ponsonby and somerset  those highlanders playing the pibroch under the shower of grape shot  those battalions of rylandt those utterly raw recruits  who hardly knew how to handle a musket holding their own against essling s and rivoli s old troops that is what was grand  wellington was tenacious  in that lay his merit  and we are not seeking to lessen it  but the least of his foot soldiers and of his cavalry would have been as solid as he  the iron soldier is worth as much as the iron duke  as for us  all our glorification goes to the english soldier  to the english army  to the english people  if trophy there be  it is to england that the trophy is due  the column of waterloo would be more just  if  instead of the figure of a man  it bore on high the statue of a people but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here  she still cherishes  after her own  and our  the feudal illusion she believes in heredity and hierarchy  this people  surpassed by none in power and glory  regards itself as a nation  and not as a people  and as a people  it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its head  as a workman  it allows itself to be disdained  as a soldier  it allows itself to be flogged it will be remembered  that at the battle of inkermann a sergeant who had  it appears  saved the army  could not be mentioned by lord paglan as the english military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports that which we admire above all  in an encounter of the nature of waterloo  is the marvellous cleverness of chance  a nocturnal rain  the wall of hougomont  the hollow road of ohain  grouchy deaf to the cannon napoleon s guide deceiving him  bulow s guide enlightening him the whole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted on the whole  let us say it plainly  it was more of a massacre than of a battle at waterloo of all pitched battles  waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants  napoleon three quarters of a league wellington  half a league  seventy two thousand combatants on each side from this denseness the carnage arose the following calculation has been made  and the following proportion established  loss of men  at austerlitz  french  fourteen per cent russians  thirty per cent  austrians  forty four per cent  at wagram french  thirteen per cent  austrians  fourteen  at the moskowa  french thirty seven per cent  russians  forty four  at bautzen  french thirteen per cent  russians and prussians  fourteen  at waterloo french  fifty six per cent  the allies  thirty one  total for waterloo forty one per cent  one hundred and forty four thousand combatants sixty thousand dead to day the field of waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth the impassive support of man  and it resembles all plains at night  moreover  a sort of visionary mist arises from it  and if a traveller strolls there  if he listens  if he watches  if he dreams like virgil in the fatal plains of philippi  the hallucination of the catastrophe takes possession of him  the frightful th of june lives again  the false monumental hillock disappears  the lion vanishes in air  the battle field resumes its reality  lines of infantry undulate over the plain  furious gallops traverse the horizon  the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres  the gleam of bayonets  the flare of bombs  the tremendous interchange of thunders  he hears  as it were the death rattle in the depths of a tomb  the vague clamor of the battle phantom  those shadows are grenadiers  those lights are cuirassiers that skeleton napoleon  that other skeleton is wellington  all this no longer exists  and yet it clashes together and combats still  and the ravines are empurpled  and the trees quiver  and there is fury even in the clouds and in the shadows  all those terrible heights  hougomont mont saint jean  frischemont  papelotte  plancenoit  appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other chapter xvii is waterloo to be considered good there exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate waterloo  we do not belong to it  to us  waterloo is but the stupefied date of liberty  that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is certainly unexpected if one places one s self at the culminating point of view of the question  waterloo is intentionally a counter revolutionary victory  it is europe against france  it is petersburg  berlin  and vienna against paris  it is the statu quo against the initiative  it is the th of july   attacked through the th of march   it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable french rioting  the final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty six years such was the dream  the solidarity of the brunswicks  the nassaus  the romanoffs  the hohenzollerns  the hapsburgs with the bourbons  waterloo bears divine right on its crupper  it is true  that the empire having been despotic  the kingdom by the natural reaction of things  was forced to be liberal  and that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of waterloo  to the great regret of the conquerors  it is because revolution cannot be really conquered  and that being providential and absolutely fatal  it is always cropping up afresh  before waterloo  in bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones after waterloo  in louis xviii  granting and conforming to the charter bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of naples  and a sergeant on the throne of sweden  employing inequality to demonstrate equality louis xviii  at saint ouen countersigns the declaration of the rights of man  if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is  call it progress  and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress call it to morrow  to morrow fulfils its work irresistibly  and it is already fulfilling it to day  it always reaches its goal strangely  it employs wellington to make of foy  who was only a soldier  an orator foy falls at hougomont and rises again in the tribune  thus does progress proceed  there is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman it does not become disconcerted  but adjusts to its divine work the man who has bestridden the alps  and the good old tottering invalid of father elysee  it makes use of the gouty man as well as of the conqueror  of the conqueror without  of the gouty man within  waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword  had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction  the slashers have finished  it was the turn of the thinkers  the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march  that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty in short  and incontestably  that which triumphed at waterloo  that which smiled in wellington s rear  that which brought him all the marshals  staffs of europe  including  it is said  the staff of a marshal of france  that which joyously trundled the barrows full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion  that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date june   that which encouraged blucher  as he put the flying army to the sword  that which  from the heights of the plateau of mont saint jean  hovered over france as over its prey  was the counter revolution  it was the counter revolution which murmured that infamous word dismemberment  on arriving in paris it beheld the crater close at hand  it felt those ashes which scorched its feet  and it changed its mind  it returned to the stammer of a charter let us behold in waterloo only that which is in waterloo  of intentional liberty there is none  the counter revolution was involuntarily liberal in the same manner as  by a corresponding phenomenon  napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary  on the th of june   the mounted robespierre was hurled from his saddle chapter xviii a recrudescence of divine right end of the dictatorship  a whole european system crumbled away the empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the roman world as it expired  again we behold the abyss  as in the days of the barbarians only the barbarism of  which must be called by its pet name of the counter revolution  was not long breathed  soon fell to panting  and halted short  the empire was bewept let us acknowledge the fact and bewept by heroic eyes  if glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre  the empire had been glory in person  it had diffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light  we will say more  an obscure light  compared to the true daylight  it is night  this disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse louis xviii  re entered paris  the circling dances of the th of july effaced the enthusiasms of the th of march  the corsican became the antithesis of the bearnese  the flag on the dome of the tuileries was white  the exile reigned  hartwell s pine table took its place in front of the fleur de lys strewn throne of louis xiv  bouvines and fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day  austerlitz having become antiquated  the altar and the throne fraternized majestically  one of the most undisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth century was established over france  and over the continent  europe adopted the white cockade  trestaillon was celebrated  the device non pluribus impar re appeared on the stone rays representing a sun upon the front of the barracks on the quai d orsay where there had been an imperial guard  there was now a red house  the arc du carrousel  all laden with badly borne victories  thrown out of its element among these novelties  a little ashamed  it may be  of marengo and arcola  extricated itself from its predicament with the statue of the duc d angouleme  the cemetery of the madeleine  a terrible pauper s grave in  was covered with jasper and marble  since the bones of louis xvi  and marie antoinette lay in that dust in the moat of vincennes a sepulchral shaft sprang from the earth recalling the fact that the duc d enghien had perished in the very month when napoleon was crowned  pope pius vii  who had performed the coronation very near this death  tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation  at schoenbrunn there was a little shadow  aged four  whom it was seditious to call the king of rome  and these things took place  and the kings resumed their thrones and the master of europe was put in a cage  and the old regime became the new regime  and all the shadows and all the light of the earth changed place  because  on the afternoon of a certain summer s day  a shepherd said to a prussian in the forest  go this way  and not that this  was a sort of lugubrious april  ancient unhealthy and poisonous realities were covered with new appearances  a lie wedded  the right divine was masked under a charter  fictions became constitutional  prejudices  superstitions and mental reservations  with article  in the heart  were varnished over with liberalism  it was the serpent s change of skin man had been rendered both greater and smaller by napoleon  under this reign of splendid matter  the ideal had received the strange name of ideology  it is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future into derision  the populace  however  that food for cannon which is so fond of the cannoneer  sought him with its glance  where is he  what is he doing  napoleon is dead  said a passer by to a veteran of marengo and waterloo  he dead  cried the soldier  you don t know him imagination distrusted this man  even when overthrown  the depths of europe were full of darkness after waterloo  something enormous remained long empty through napoleon s disappearance the kings placed themselves in this void  ancient europe profited by it to undertake reforms  there was a holy alliance  belle alliance beautiful alliance  the fatal field of waterloo had said in advance in presence and in face of that antique europe reconstructed  the features of a new france were sketched out  the future  which the emperor had rallied  made its entry  on its brow it bore the star liberty  the glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it singular fact  people were  at one and the same time  in love with the future  liberty  and the past  napoleon  defeat had rendered the vanquished greater  bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than napoleon erect  those who had triumphed were alarmed  england had him guarded by hudson lowe  and france had him watched by montchenu  his folded arms became a source of uneasiness to thrones  alexander called him my sleeplessness  this terror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him  that is what explains and excuses bonapartist liberalism  this phantom caused the old world to tremble the kings reigned  but ill at their ease  with the rock of saint helena on the horizon while napoleon was passing through the death struggle at longwood  the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of waterloo were quietly rotting  and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world the congress of vienna made the treaties in  and europe called this the restoration this is what waterloo was but what matters it to the infinite  all that tempest  all that cloud that war  then that peace  all that darkness did not trouble for a moment the light of that immense eye before which a grub skipping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry on the towers of notre dame chapter xix the battle field at night let us return it is a necessity in this book to that fatal battle field on the th of june the moon was full  its light favored blucher s ferocious pursuit  betrayed the traces of the fugitives  delivered up that disastrous mass to the eager prussian cavalry  and aided the massacre  such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes after the last cannon shot had been fired  the plain of mont saint jean remained deserted the english occupied the encampment of the french  it is the usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished  they established their bivouac beyond rossomme  the prussians  let loose on the retreating rout  pushed forward  wellington went to the village of waterloo to draw up his report to lord bathurst if ever the sic vos non vobis was applicable  it certainly is to that village of waterloo  waterloo took no part  and lay half a league from the scene of action  mont saint jean was cannonaded  hougomont was burned  la haie sainte was taken by assault  papelotte was burned plancenoit was burned  la belle alliance beheld the embrace of the two conquerors  these names are hardly known  and waterloo  which worked not in the battle  bears off all the honor we are not of the number of those who flatter war  when the occasion presents itself  we tell the truth about it  war has frightful beauties which we have not concealed  it has also  we acknowledge  some hideous features  one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory  the dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses who does this  who thus soils the triumph  what hideous  furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory  what pickpockets are they who ply their trade in the rear of glory  some philosophers voltaire among the number affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory  it is the same men  they say  there is no relief corps  those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth  the hero of the day is the vampire of the night  one has assuredly the right  after all  to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse  for our own part  we do not think so  it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and purloin the shoes from a dead man one thing is certain  which is  that generally after conquerors follow thieves  but let us leave the soldier  especially the contemporary soldier  out of the question every army has a rear guard  and it is that which must be blamed bat like creatures  half brigands and lackeys  all the sorts of vespertillos that that twilight called war engenders  wearers of uniforms  who take no part in the fighting  pretended invalids formidable limpers  interloping sutlers  trotting along in little carts sometimes accompanied by their wives  and stealing things which they sell again  beggars offering themselves as guides to officers  soldiers servants  marauders  armies on the march in days gone by we are not speaking of the present dragged all this behind them  so that in the special language they are called stragglers  no army  no nation was responsible for those beings  they spoke italian and followed the germans  then spoke french and followed the english  it was by one of these wretches  a spanish straggler who spoke french  that the marquis of fervacques  deceived by his picard jargon  and taking him for one of our own men  was traitorously slain and robbed on the battle field itself  in the course of the night which followed the victory of cerisoles  the rascal sprang from this marauding  the detestable maxim live on the enemy  produced this leprosy  which a strict discipline alone could heal  there are reputations which are deceptive  one does not always know why certain generals  great in other directions  have been so popular  turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage  evil permitted constitutes part of goodness  turenne was so good that he allowed the palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood  the marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number  according as the chief was more or less severe  hoche and marceau had no stragglers  wellington had few  and we do him the justice to mention it nevertheless  on the night from the th to the th of june  the dead were robbed  wellington was rigid  he gave orders that any one caught in the act should be shot  but rapine is tenacious  the marauders stole in one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another the moon was sinister over this plain towards midnight  a man was prowling about  or rather  climbing in the direction of the hollow road of ohain  to all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described neither english nor french  neither peasant nor soldier  less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory  and come to rifle waterloo  he was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat he was uneasy and audacious  he walked forwards and gazed behind him who was this man  the night probably knew more of him than the day  he had no sack  but evidently he had large pockets under his coat  from time to time he halted  scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed  bent over abruptly  disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground  then rose and fled  his sliding motion  his attitudes  his mysterious and rapid gestures  caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins  and which ancient norman legends call the alleurs certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes a glance capable of piercing all that mist deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little sutler s wagon with a fluted wicker hood  harnessed to a famished nag which was cropping the grass across its bit as it halted  hidden  as it were  behind the hovel which adjoins the highway to nivelles  at the angle of the road from mont saint jean to braine l alleud  and in the wagon  a sort of woman seated on coffers and packages  perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler the darkness was serene  not a cloud in the zenith  what matters it if the earth be red  the moon remains white  these are the indifferences of the sky  in the fields  branches of trees broken by grape shot  but not fallen  upheld by their bark  swayed gently in the breeze of night a breath  almost a respiration  moved the shrubbery  quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the english camp were audible hougomont and la haie sainte continued to burn  forming  one in the west  the other in the east  two great flames which were joined by the cordon of bivouac fires of the english  like a necklace of rubies with two carbuncles at the extremities  as they extended in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon we have described the catastrophe of the road of ohain  the heart is terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many brave men if there is anything terrible  if there exists a reality which surpasses dreams  it is this  to live  to see the sun  to be in full possession of virile force  to possess health and joy  to laugh valiantly  to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one  to feel in one s breast lungs which breathe  a heart which beats  a will which reasons  to speak  think  hope  love  to have a mother  to have a wife to have children  to have the light and all at once  in the space of a shout  in less than a minute  to sink into an abyss  to fall  to roll  to crush  to be crushed  to see ears of wheat  flowers  leaves branches  not to be able to catch hold of anything  to feel one s sword useless  men beneath one  horses on top of one  to struggle in vain since one s bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness  to feel a heel which makes one s eyes start from their sockets  to bite horses shoes in one s rage  to stifle  to yell  to writhe  to be beneath  and to say to one s self  but just a little while ago i was a living man there  where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death rattle all was silence now  the edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders  inextricably heaped up  terrible entanglement  there was no longer any slope  for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain  and reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley  a heap of dead bodies in the upper part  a river of blood in the lower part such was that road on the evening of the th of june   the blood ran even to the nivelles highway  and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the abatis of trees which barred the way  at a spot which is still pointed out it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point  in the direction of the genappe road  that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place  the thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road  towards the middle  at the point where it became level  where delort s division had passed  the layer of corpses was thinner the nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going in that direction  he was searching that vast tomb  he gazed about  he passed the dead in some sort of hideous review  he walked with his feet in the blood all at once he paused a few paces in front of him  in the hollow road  at the point where the pile of dead came to an end  an open hand  illumined by the moon projected from beneath that heap of men  that hand had on its finger something sparkling  which was a ring of gold the man bent over  remained in a crouching attitude for a moment  and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand he did not precisely rise  he remained in a stooping and frightened attitude  with his back turned to the heap of dead  scanning the horizon on his knees  with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two forefingers  which rested on the earth  and his head peering above the edge of the hollow road  the jackal s four paws suit some actions then coming to a decision  he rose to his feet at that moment  he gave a terrible start  he felt some one clutch him from behind he wheeled round  it was the open hand  which had closed  and had seized the skirt of his coat an honest man would have been terrified  this man burst into a laugh come  said he  it s only a dead body  i prefer a spook to a gendarme but the hand weakened and released him  effort is quickly exhausted in the grave well now  said the prowler  is that dead fellow alive  let s see he bent down again  fumbled among the heap  pushed aside everything that was in his way  seized the hand  grasped the arm  freed the head  pulled out the body  and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless  or at least the unconscious  man  through the shadows of hollow road  he was a cuirassier  an officer  and even an officer of considerable rank a large gold epaulette peeped from beneath the cuirass  this officer no longer possessed a helmet  a furious sword cut had scarred his face where nothing was discernible but blood however  he did not appear to have any broken limbs  and  by some happy chance  if that word is permissible here  the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed  his eyes were still closed on his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the legion of honor the prowler tore off this cross  which disappeared into one of the gulfs which he had beneath his great coat then he felt of the officer s fob  discovered a watch there  and took possession of it  next he searched his waistcoat  found a purse and pocketed it when he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering to this dying man  the officer opened his eyes thanks  he said feebly the abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him  the freshness of the night  the air which he could inhale freely  had roused him from his lethargy the prowler made no reply  he raised his head  a sound of footsteps was audible in the plain  some patrol was probably approaching the officer murmured  for the death agony was still in his voice who won the battle the english  answered the prowler the officer went on look in my pockets  you will find a watch and a purse  take them it was already done the prowler executed the required feint  and said there is nothing there i have been robbed  said the officer  i am sorry for that  you should have had them the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct some one is coming  said the prowler  with the movement of a man who is taking his departure the officer raised his arm feebly  and detained him you have saved my life  who are you the prowler answered rapidly  and in a low voice like yourself  i belonged to the french army  i must leave you  if they were to catch me  they would shoot me  i have saved your life  now get out of the scrape yourself what is your rank sergeant what is your name thenardier i shall not forget that name  said the officer  and do you remember mine  my name is pontmercy book second the ship orion chapter i number  becomes number jean valjean had been recaptured the reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad details  we will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published by the journals of that day  a few months after the surprising events which had taken place at m  sur m these articles are rather summary  it must be remembered  that at that epoch the gazette des tribunaux was not yet in existence we borrow the first from the drapeau blanc  it bears the date of july  an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course  a man  who was a stranger in the department  and who bore the name of m  madeleine  had  thanks to the new methods  resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry  the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets  he had made his fortune in the business  and that of the arrondissement as well  we will admit he had been appointed mayor  in recognition of his services  the police discovered that m  madeleine was no other than an ex convict who had broken his ban  condemned in  for theft  and named jean valjean jean valjean has been recommitted to prison  it appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m laffitte  a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there  and which he had  moreover  and by perfectly legitimate means  acquired in his business  no one has been able to discover where jean valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon the second article  which enters a little more into detail  is an extract from the journal de paris  of the same date a former convict  who had been liberated  named jean valjean  has just appeared before the court of assizes of the var  under circumstances calculated to attract attention  this wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police  he had changed his name  and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns in this town he had established a considerable commerce  he has at last been unmasked and arrested  thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor  he had for his concubine a woman of the town  who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest  this scoundrel  who is endowed with herculean strength  found means to escape  but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more in paris itself  at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of montfermeil seine et oise  he is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty  to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers  this sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs  if the indictment is to be trusted  he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone and it has not been possible to lay hands on it  however that may be the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of the var as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence  about eight years ago  on the person of one of those honest children who  as the patriarch of ferney has said  in immortal verse              arrive from savoy every year            and who  with gentle hands  do clear            those long canals choked up with soot this bandit refused to defend himself  it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor  that the theft was committed in complicity with others  and that jean valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south  jean valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence  this criminal refused to lodge an appeal  the king  in his inexhaustible clemency  has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life  jean valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon the reader has not forgotten that jean valjean had religious habits at m  sur m  some papers  among others the constitutional  presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party jean valjean changed his number in the galleys  he was called however  and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject  the prosperity of m  sur m  vanished with m  madeleine  all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized  lacking him  there actually was a soul lacking  after this fall  there took place at m  sur m  that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen  that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day  obscurely  in the human community  and which history has noted only once  because it occurred after the death of alexander  lieutenants are crowned kings superintendents improvise manufacturers out of themselves  envious rivalries arose  m  madeleine s vast workshops were shut  his buildings fell to ruin  his workmen were scattered  some of them quitted the country  others abandoned the trade  thenceforth  everything was done on a small scale  instead of on a grand scale  for lucre instead of the general good  there was no longer a centre  everywhere there was competition and animosity  m  madeleine had reigned over all and directed all  no sooner had he fallen  than each pulled things to himself  the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization bitterness to cordiality  hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all  the threads which m  madeleine had set were tangled and broken  the methods were adulterated  the products were debased  confidence was killed  the market diminished  for lack of orders  salaries were reduced  the workshops stood still  bankruptcy arrived  and then there was nothing more for the poor  all had vanished the state itself perceived that some one had been crushed somewhere less than four years after the judgment of the court of assizes establishing the identity of jean valjean and m  madeleine  for the benefit of the galleys  the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of m  sur m  and m  de villele called attention to the fact in the rostrum  in the month of february  chapter ii in which the reader will peruse two verses  which are of the devil s composition  possibly before proceeding further  it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail  a singular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch in montfermeil  and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment there exists in the region of montfermeil a very ancient superstition which is all the more curious and all the more precious  because a popular superstition in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in siberia  we are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant  here  then  is the superstition of montfermeil it is thought that the devil  from time immemorial  has selected the forest as a hiding place for his treasures  goodwives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall  in secluded nooks of the forest a black man with the air of a carter or a wood chopper  wearing wooden shoes  clad in trousers and a blouse of linen  and recognizable by the fact  that  instead of a cap or hat  he has two immense horns on his head  this ought  in fact  to render him recognizable  this man is habitually engaged in digging a hole  there are three ways of profiting by such an encounter  the first is to approach the man and speak to him then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant  that he appears black because it is nightfall  that he is not digging any hole whatever  but is cutting grass for his cows  and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung fork which he is carrying on his back  and whose teeth  thanks to the perspective of evening  seemed to spring from his head  the man returns home and dies within the week  the second way is to watch him  to wait until he has dug his hole  until he has filled it and has gone away  then to run with great speed to the trench  to open it once more and to seize the treasure  which the black man has necessarily placed there  in this case one dies within the month finally  the last method is not to speak to the black man  not to look at him  and to flee at the best speed of one s legs  one then dies within the year as all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences  the second  which at all events  presents some advantages  among others that of possessing a treasure  if only for a month  is the one most generally adopted  so bold men  who are tempted by every chance  have quite frequently  as we are assured  opened the holes excavated by the black man  and tried to rob the devil  the success of the operation appears to be but moderate  at least  if the tradition is to be believed  and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous latin  which an evil norman monk  a bit of a sorcerer  named tryphon has left on this subject  this tryphon is buried at the abbey of saint georges de bocherville  near rouen  and toads spawn on his grave accordingly  enormous efforts are made  such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep  a man sweats  digs  toils all night for it must be done at night  he wets his shirt  burns out his candle  breaks his mattock and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole  when he lays his hand on the treasure  what does he find  what is the devil s treasure  a sou sometimes a crown piece  a stone  a skeleton  a bleeding body  sometimes a spectre folded in four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio sometimes nothing  this is what tryphon s verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious           fodit  et in fossa thesauros condit opaca            as  nummas  lapides  cadaver  simulacra  nihilque it seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powder horn with bullets  sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn  which has evidently served the devil  tryphon does not record these two finds since tryphon lived in the twelfth century  and since the devil does not appear to have had the wit to invent powder before roger bacon s time and cards before the time of charles vi moreover  if one plays at cards  one is sure to lose all that one possesses  and as for the powder in the horn  it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face now  a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around montfermeil  it was remarked in that village that a certain old road laborer  named boulatruelle  had peculiar ways  in the forest  people thereabouts thought they knew that this boulatruelle had been in the galleys  he was subjected to certain police supervision  and  as he could find work nowhere  the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road mender on the cross road from gagny to lagny this boulatruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful  too humble  too prompt in removing his cap to every one  and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes probably affiliated to robber bands  they said suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall  the only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard this is what people thought they had noticed of late  boulatruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking and care of the road at a very early hour  and to betaking himself to the forest with his pickaxe  he was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings  in the wildest thickets  and he had the appearance of being in search of something  and sometimes he was digging holes  the goodwives who passed took him at first for beelzebub  then they recognized boulatruelle  and were not in the least reassured thereby  these encounters seemed to cause boulatruelle a lively displeasure  it was evident that he sought to hide  and that there was some mystery in what he was doing it was said in the village  it is clear that the devil has appeared boulatruelle has seen him  and is on the search  in sooth  he is cunning enough to pocket lucifer s hoard the voltairians added  will boulatruelle catch the devil  or will the devil catch boulatruelle  the old women made a great many signs of the cross in the meantime  boulatruelle s manoeuvres in the forest ceased  and he resumed his regular occupation of roadmending  and people gossiped of something else some persons  however  were still curious  surmising that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends  but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil s bank bills  and that the road mender had half discovered the secret  the most puzzled  were the school master and thenardier  the proprietor of the tavern  who was everybody s friend  and had not disdained to ally himself with boulatruelle he has been in the galleys  said thenardier  eh  good god  no one knows who has been there or will be there one evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what boulatruelle did in the forest and that the latter would have been forced to speak  and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need  and that boulatruelle would not have resisted the water test  for example  let us put him to the wine test  said thenardier they made an effort  and got the old road mender to drinking boulatruelle drank an enormous amount  but said very little  he combined with admirable art  and in masterly proportions  the thirst of a gormandizer with the discretion of a judge  nevertheless  by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him  this is what thenardier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out one morning  when boulatruelle was on his way to his work  at daybreak he had been surprised to see  at a nook of the forest in the underbrush a shovel and a pickaxe  concealed  as one might say however  he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six fours  the water carrier  and would have thought no more about it  but  on the evening of that day  he saw  without being seen himself  as he was hidden by a large tree  a person who did not belong in those parts  and whom he  boulatruelle  knew well  directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood  translation by thenardier  a comrade of the galleys  boulatruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name  this person carried a package something square like a large box or a small trunk  surprise on the part of boulatruelle however  it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that person  had occurred to him  but it was too late  the person was already in the thicket  night had descended  and boulatruelle had not been able to catch up with him  then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods  it was moonlight  two or three hours later  boulatruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood  carrying no longer the coffer  but a shovel and pick  boulatruelle had allowed the person to pass  and had not dreamed of accosting him  because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was  and armed with a pickaxe  and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him  and on perceiving that he was recognized  touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again  but the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to boulatruelle  he had hastened to the thicket in the morning  and had found neither shovel nor pick  from this he had drawn the inference that this person  once in the forest  had dug a hole with his pick  buried the coffer  and reclosed the hole with his shovel  now  the coffer was too small to contain a body  therefore it contained money  hence his researches  boulatruelle had explored  sounded  searched the entire forest and the thicket  and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up  in vain he had ferreted out  nothing  no one in montfermeil thought any more about it  there were only a few brave gossips  who said  you may be certain that the mender on the gagny road did not take all that trouble for nothing  he was sure that the devil had come chapter iii the ankle chain must have undergone a certain preparatory manipulation to be thus broken with a blow from a hammer towards the end of october  in that same year   the inhabitants of toulon beheld the entry into their port  after heavy weather  and for the purpose of repairing some damages  of the ship orion  which was employed later at brest as a school ship  and which then formed a part of the mediterranean squadron this vessel  battered as it was for the sea had handled it roughly produced a fine effect as it entered the roads  it flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns  which it returned  shot for shot  total  twenty two  it has been calculated that what with salvos  royal and military politenesses  courteous exchanges of uproar  signals of etiquette  formalities of roadsteads and citadels  sunrises and sunsets  saluted every day by all fortresses and all ships of war  openings and closings of ports  etc  the civilized world  discharged all over the earth  in the course of four and twenty hours  one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots  at six francs the shot  that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day  three hundred millions a year  which vanish in smoke  this is a mere detail  all this time the poor were dying of hunger the year  was what the restoration called the epoch of the spanish war this war contained many events in one  and a quantity of peculiarities a grand family affair for the house of bourbon  the branch of france succoring and protecting the branch of madrid  that is to say performing an act devolving on the elder  an apparent return to our national traditions  complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the north  m  le duc d angouleme  surnamed by the liberal sheets the hero of andujar  compressing in a triumphal attitude that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air  the ancient and very powerful terrorism of the holy office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of the liberals  the sansculottes resuscitated  to the great terror of dowagers  under the name of descamisados  monarchy opposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy  the theories of  roughly interrupted in the sap  a european halt  called to the french idea which was making the tour of the world  beside the son of france as generalissimo  the prince de carignan  afterwards charles albert enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer  with grenadier epaulets of red worsted  the soldiers of the empire setting out on a fresh campaign  but aged  saddened  after eight years of repose  and under the white cockade  the tricolored standard waved abroad by a heroic handful of frenchmen  as the white standard had been thirty years earlier at coblentz  monks mingled with our troops the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets principles slaughtered by cannonades  france undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind  in addition to this  hostile leaders sold  soldiers hesitating  cities besieged by millions  no military perils  and yet possible explosions  as in every mine which is surprised and invaded  but little bloodshed  little honor won  shame for some glory for no one  such was this war  made by the princes descended from louis xiv  and conducted by generals who had been under napoleon  its sad fate was to recall neither the grand war nor grand politics some feats of arms were serious  the taking of the trocadero  among others  was a fine military action  but after all  we repeat  the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound  the whole effect was suspicious  history approves of france for making a difficulty about accepting this false triumph  it seemed evident that certain spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too easily  the idea of corruption was connected with the victory  it appears as though generals and not battles had been won  and the conquering soldier returned humiliated  a debasing war  in short  in which the bank of france could be read in the folds of the flag soldiers of the war of  on whom saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin  frowned in  at the easy surrender of citadels  and began to regret palafox  it is the nature of france to prefer to have rostopchine rather than ballesteros in front of her from a still more serious point of view  and one which it is also proper to insist upon here  this war  which wounded the military spirit of france  enraged the democratic spirit  it was an enterprise of inthralment  in that campaign  the object of the french soldier  the son of democracy  was the conquest of a yoke for others  a hideous contradiction  france is made to arouse the soul of nations  not to stifle it  all the revolutions of europe since  are the french revolution  liberty darts rays from france  that is a solar fact  blind is he who will not see  it was bonaparte who said it the war of  an outrage on the generous spanish nation  was then at the same time  an outrage on the french revolution  it was france who committed this monstrous violence  by foul means  for  with the exception of wars of liberation  everything that armies do is by foul means  the words passive obedience indicate this  an army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence  thus is war  made by humanity against humanity  despite humanity  explained as for the bourbons  the war of  was fatal to them  they took it for a success  they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order  they went astray  in their innocence  to such a degree that they introduced the immense enfeeblement of a crime into their establishment as an element of strength  the spirit of the ambush entered into their politics   had its germ in  the spanish campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by right divine  france  having re established elrey netto in spain  might well have re established the absolute king at home  they fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation  such confidence is the ruin of thrones  it is not permitted to fall asleep  either in the shadow of a machineel tree nor in the shadow of an army let us return to the ship orion during the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo a squadron had been cruising in the mediterranean  we have just stated that the orion belonged to this fleet  and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at toulon the presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd  it is because it is great  and the crowd loves what is great a ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature a ship of the line is composed  at the same time  of the heaviest and the lightest of possible matter  for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance solid  liquid  and fluid and it must do battle with all three  it has eleven claws of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea  and more wings and more antennae than winged insects  to catch the wind in the clouds  its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannons as through enormous trumpets  and replies proudly to the thunder  the ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows  but the vessel has its soul  its compass  which counsels it and always shows it the north  in the blackest nights  its lanterns supply the place of the stars  thus  against the wind  it has its cordage and its canvas against the water  wood  against the rocks  its iron  brass  and lead against the shadows  its light  against immensity  a needle if one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which taken as a whole  constitute the ship of the line  one has only to enter one of the six story covered construction stocks  in the ports of brest or toulon  the vessels in process of construction are under a bell glass there  as it were  this colossal beam is a yard  that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the main mast  taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds  it is sixty fathoms long  and its diameter at its base is three feet  the english main mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the water line  the navy of our fathers employed cables  ours employs chains  the simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high  twenty feet in breadth  and eight feet in depth  and how much wood is required to make this ship  three thousand cubic metres  it is a floating forest and moreover  let this be borne in mind  it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago  of the simple sailing vessel steam  then in its infancy  has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel  at the present time  for example  the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine  propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horse power not to mention these new marvels  the ancient vessel of christopher columbus and of de ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man  it is as inexhaustible in force as is the infinite in gales  it stores up the wind in its sails  it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows  it floats  and it reigns there comes an hour  nevertheless  when the gale breaks that sixty foot yard like a straw  when the wind bends that mast four hundred feet tall when that anchor  which weighs tens of thousands  is twisted in the jaws of the waves like a fisherman s hook in the jaws of a pike  when those monstrous cannons utter plaintive and futile roars  which the hurricane bears forth into the void and into night  when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and majesty which are superior every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought  hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why  every day accordingly  from morning until night  the quays  sluices  and the jetties of the port of toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and loungers  as they say in paris  whose business consisted in staring at the orion the orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time  in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keel to such a degree as to deprive it of half its speed  it had gone into the dry dock the year before this  in order to have the barnacles scraped off  then it had put to sea again  but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel  in the neighborhood of the balearic isles the sides had been strained and had opened  and  as the plating in those days was not of sheet iron  the vessel had sprung a leak a violent equinoctial gale had come up  which had first staved in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side  and damaged the foretop gallant shrouds  in consequence of these injuries  the orion had run back to toulon it anchored near the arsenal  it was fully equipped  and repairs were begun  the hull had received no damage on the starboard  but some of the planks had been unnailed here and there  according to custom  to permit of air entering the hold one morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident illustration  the ship orion  an accident b the ship orion the crew was busy bending the sails  the topman  who had to take the upper corner of the main top sail on the starboard  lost his balance he was seen to waver  the multitude thronging the arsenal quay uttered a cry  the man s head overbalanced his body  the man fell around the yard with his hands outstretched towards the abyss  on his way he seized the footrope  first with one hand  then with the other  and remained hanging from it  the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth  the shock of his fall had imparted to the foot rope a violent swinging motion  the man swayed back and forth at the end of that rope  like a stone in a sling it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance  not one of the sailors  all fishermen of the coast  recently levied for the service  dared to attempt it  in the meantime  the unfortunate topman was losing his strength  his anguish could not be discerned on his face but his exhaustion was visible in every limb  his arms were contracted in horrible twitchings  every effort which he made to re ascend served but to augment the oscillations of the foot rope  he did not shout  for fear of exhausting his strength  all were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the rope  and  from instant to instant  heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen  there are moments when a bit of rope  a pole  the branch of a tree  is life itself  and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit all at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the agility of a tiger cat  this man was dressed in red  he was a convict  he wore a green cap  he was a life convict  on arriving on a level with the top  a gust of wind carried away his cap  and allowed a perfectly white head to be seen  he was not a young man a convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had  in fact  at the very first instant  hastened to the officer of the watch and  in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back  he had asked the officer s permission to risk his life to save the topman  at an affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer  then he had caught up a rope  and had dashed into the rigging  no one noticed  at the instant  with what ease that chain had been broken  it was only later on that the incident was recalled in a twinkling he was on the yard  he paused for a few seconds and appeared to be measuring it with his eye  these seconds  during which the breeze swayed the topman at the extremity of a thread  seemed centuries to those who were looking on  at last  the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step  the crowd drew a long breath  he was seen to run out along the yard  on arriving at the point  he fastened the rope which he had brought to it  and allowed the other end to hang down  then he began to descend the rope  hand over hand  and then and the anguish was indescribable instead of one man suspended over the gulf  there were two one would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly  only here the spider brought life  not death  ten thousand glances were fastened on this group  not a cry  not a word  the same tremor contracted every brow  all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men in the meantime  the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a position near the sailor  it was high time  one minute more  and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss  the convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand  while he was working with the other  at last  he was seen to climb back on the yard  and to drag the sailor up after him he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength  then he grasped him in his arms and carried him  walking on the yard himself to the cap  and from there to the main top  where he left him in the hands of his comrades at that moment the crowd broke into applause  old convict sergeants among them wept  and women embraced each other on the quay  and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rage  pardon for that man he  in the meantime  had immediately begun to make his descent to rejoin his detachment  in order to reach them the more speedily  he dropped into the rigging  and ran along one of the lower yards  all eyes were following him  at a certain moment fear assailed them  whether it was that he was fatigued  or that his head turned  they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger  all at once the crowd uttered a loud shout  the convict had fallen into the sea the fall was perilous  the frigate algesiras was anchored alongside the orion  and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels  it was to be feared that he would slip under one or the other of them  four men flung themselves hastily into a boat  the crowd cheered them on anxiety again took possession of all souls  the man had not risen to the surface  he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple  as though he had fallen into a cask of oil  they sounded  they dived  in vain  the search was continued until the evening  they did not even find the body on the following day the toulon newspaper printed these lines nov    yesterday  a convict belonging to the detachment on board of the orion  on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor fell into the sea and was drowned  the body has not yet been found  it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the arsenal point this man was committed under the number  and his name was jean valjean book third accomplishment of the promise made to the dead woman chapter i the water question at montfermeil montfermeil is situated between livry and chelles  on the southern edge of that lofty table land which separates the ourcq from the marne  at the present day it is a tolerably large town  ornamented all the year through with plaster villas  and on sundays with beaming bourgeois  in  there were at montfermeil neither so many white houses nor so many well satisfied citizens  it was only a village in the forest  some pleasure houses of the last century were to be met with there  to be sure  which were recognizable by their grand air  their balconies in twisted iron  and their long windows  whose tiny panes cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters  but montfermeil was none the less a village  retired cloth merchants and rusticating attorneys had not discovered it as yet  it was a peaceful and charming place  which was not on the road to anywhere  there people lived  and cheaply  that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy  only  water was rare there  on account of the elevation of the plateau it was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance  the end of the village towards gagny drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there  the other end  which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles  found drinking water only at a little spring half way down the slope  near the road to chelles  about a quarter of an hour from montfermeil thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water  the large houses  the aristocracy  of which the thenardier tavern formed a part  paid half a farthing a bucketful to a man who made a business of it  and who earned about eight sous a day in his enterprise of supplying montfermeil with water  but this good man only worked until seven o clock in the evening in summer  and five in winter  and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed  he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or did without it this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten little cosette  it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the thenardiers in two ways  they made the mother pay them  and they made the child serve them  so when the mother ceased to pay altogether  the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters  the thenardiers kept cosette  she took the place of a servant in their house  in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required  so the child  who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night  took great care that water should never be lacking in the house christmas of the year  was particularly brilliant at montfermeil the beginning of the winter had been mild  there had been neither snow nor frost up to that time  some mountebanks from paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village  and a band of itinerant merchants  under protection of the same tolerance  had constructed their stalls on the church square and even extended them into boulanger alley  where  as the reader will perhaps remember  the thenardiers  hostelry was situated  these people filled the inns and drinking shops  and communicated to that tranquil little district a noisy and joyous life  in order to play the part of a faithful historian  we ought even to add that  among the curiosities displayed in the square  there was a menagerie  in which frightful clowns  clad in rags and coming no one knew whence  exhibited to the peasants of montfermeil in  one of those horrible brazilian vultures  such as our royal museum did not possess until  and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye  i believe that naturalists call this bird caracara polyborus  it belongs to the order of the apicides and to the family of the vultures  some good old bonapartist soldiers who had retired to the village  went to see this creature with great devotion  the mountebanks gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made by god expressly for their menagerie on christmas eve itself  a number of men  carters  and peddlers  were seated at table  drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public room of thenardier s hostelry  this room resembled all drinking shop rooms tables  pewter jugs  bottles  drinkers  smokers but little light and a great deal of noise  the date of the year was indicated  nevertheless  by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class  to wit  a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin the female thenardier was attending to the supper  which was roasting in front of a clear fire  her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects the spanish war and m  le duc d angouleme  strictly local parentheses like the following  were audible amid the uproar about nanterre and suresnes the vines have flourished greatly  when ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve  they have yielded a great deal of juice under the press  but the grapes cannot be ripe in those parts the grapes should not be ripe  the wine turns oily as soon as spring comes  then it is very thin wine  there are wines poorer even than these  the grapes must be gathered while green  etc or a miller would call out are we responsible for what is in the sacks  we find in them a quantity of small seed which we cannot sift out  and which we are obliged to send through the mill stones  there are tares  fennel  vetches  hempseed fox tail  and a host of other weeds  not to mention pebbles  which abound in certain wheat  especially in breton wheat  i am not fond of grinding breton wheat  any more than long sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them  you can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding  and then people complain of the flour  they are in the wrong  the flour is no fault of ours in a space between two windows a mower  who was seated at table with a landed proprietor who was fixing on a price for some meadow work to be performed in the spring  was saying it does no harm to have the grass wet  it cuts better  dew is a good thing  sir  it makes no difference with that grass  your grass is young and very hard to cut still  it s terribly tender  it yields before the iron  etc cosette was in her usual place  seated on the cross bar of the kitchen table near the chimney  she was in rags  her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes  and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings destined for the young thenardiers  a very young kitten was playing about among the chairs  laughter and chatter were audible in the adjoining room  from two fresh children s voices  it was eponine and azelma in the chimney corner a cat o nine tails was hanging on a nail at intervals the cry of a very young child  which was somewhere in the house  rang through the noise of the dram shop  it was a little boy who had been born to the thenardiers during one of the preceding winters she did not know why  she said  the result of the cold and who was a little more than three years old  the mother had nursed him  but she did not love him  when the persistent clamor of the brat became too annoying  your son is squalling  thenardier would say  do go and see what he wants  bah  the mother would reply  he bothers me  and the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark chapter ii two complete portraits so far in this book the thenardiers have been viewed only in profile the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple  and considering it under all its aspects thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday  madame thenardier was approaching her forties  which is equivalent to fifty in a woman  so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this thenardier woman  ever since her first appearance tall  blond  red  fat  angular square  enormous  and agile  she belonged  as we have said  to the race of those colossal wild women  who contort themselves at fairs with paving stones hanging from their hair  she did everything about the house made the beds  did the washing  the cooking  and everything else  cosette was her only servant  a mouse in the service of an elephant  everything trembled at the sound of her voice window panes furniture  and people  her big face  dotted with red blotches presented the appearance of a skimmer  she had a beard  she was an ideal market porter dressed in woman s clothes  she swore splendidly  she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow of her fist  except for the romances which she had read  and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times  in a very queer way  the idea would never have occurred to any one to say of her  that is a woman this thenardier female was like the product of a wench engrafted on a fishwife  when one heard her speak  one said  that is a gendarme  when one saw her drink  one said  that is a carter  when one saw her handle cosette  one said  that is the hangman  one of her teeth projected when her face was in repose thenardier was a small  thin  pale  angular  bony  feeble man  who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy  his cunning began here he smiled habitually  by way of precaution  and was almost polite to everybody  even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing  he had the glance of a pole cat and the bearing of a man of letters  he greatly resembled the portraits of the abbe delille  his coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters  no one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk  he smoked a big pipe  he wore a blouse  and under his blouse an old black coat  he made pretensions to literature and to materialism there were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying voltaire  raynal  parny  and  singularly enough  saint augustine  he declared that he had a system  in addition  he was a great swindler  a filousophe philosophe  a scientific thief  the species does exist  it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army  he was in the habit of relating with exuberance  how  being a sergeant in the th or the th light something or other  at waterloo  he had alone  and in the presence of a squadron of death dealing hussars  covered with his body and saved from death  in the midst of the grape shot  a general  who had been dangerously wounded  thence arose for his wall the flaring sign  and for his inn the name which it bore in the neighborhood  of the cabaret of the sergeant of waterloo  he was a liberal  a classic  and a bonapartist  he had subscribed for the champ d asile  it was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood we believe that he had simply studied in holland for an inn keeper  this rascal of composite order was  in all probability  some fleming from lille  in flanders  a frenchman in paris  a belgian at brussels  being comfortably astride of both frontiers  as for his prowess at waterloo the reader is already acquainted with that  it will be perceived that he exaggerated it a trifle  ebb and flow  wandering  adventure  was the leven of his existence  a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life  and  apparently at the stormy epoch of june   thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding sutlers of which we have spoken beating about the country  selling to some  stealing from others  and travelling like a family man  with wife and children  in a rickety cart  in the rear of troops on the march  with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army  this campaign ended  and having  as he said  some quibus  he had come to montfermeil and set up an inn there this quibus  composed of purses and watches  of gold rings and silver crosses  gathered in harvest time in furrows sown with corpses  did not amount to a large total  and did not carry this sutler turned eating house keeper very far thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which  accompanied by an oath  recalls the barracks  and by a sign of the cross  the seminary  he was a fine talker  he allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man  nevertheless  the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly he composed the travellers  tariff card in a superior manner  but practised eyes sometimes spied out orthographical errors in it thenardier was cunning  greedy  slothful  and clever  he did not disdain his servants  which caused his wife to dispense with them  this giantess was jealous  it seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object coveted by all thenardier  who was  above all  an astute and well balanced man  was a scamp of a temperate sort  this is the worst species  hypocrisy enters into it it is not that thenardier was not  on occasion  capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife  but this was very rare  and at such times  since he was enraged with the human race in general  as he bore within him a deep furnace of hatred  and since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs  who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen them  and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand  as a legitimate grievance  the sum total of the deceptions  the bankruptcies and the calamities of their lives when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes  he was terrible  woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time in addition to his other qualities  thenardier was attentive and penetrating  silent or talkative  according to circumstances  and always highly intelligent  he had something of the look of sailors  who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses thenardier was a statesman every new comer who entered the tavern said  on catching sight of madame thenardier  there is the master of the house  a mistake  she was not even the mistress  the husband was both master and mistress  she worked he created  he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action  a word was sufficient for him  sometimes a sign  the mastodon obeyed  thenardier was a sort of special and sovereign being in madame thenardier s eyes  though she did not thoroughly realize it she was possessed of virtues after her own kind  if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with monsieur thenardier which was an inadmissible hypothesis  by the way she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever  she would never have committed before strangers  that mistake so often committed by women and which is called in parliamentary language  exposing the crown although their concord had only evil as its result  there was contemplation in madame thenardier s submission to her husband  that mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot  viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side  this was that grand and universal thing  the adoration of mind by matter  for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty  there was an unknown quantity about thenardier  hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman  at certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle  at others she felt him like a claw this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children  and who did not fear any one except her husband  she was a mother because she was mammiferous  but her maternity stopped short with her daughters  and  as we shall see  did not extend to boys  the man had but one thought how to enrich himself he did not succeed in this  a theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking  thenardier was ruining himself at montfermeil  if ruin is possible to zero  in switzerland or in the pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire  but an inn keeper must browse where fate has hitched him it will be understood that the word inn keeper is here employed in a restricted sense  and does not extend to an entire class in this same year   thenardier was burdened with about fifteen hundred francs  worth of petty debts  and this rendered him anxious whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case thenardier was one of those men who understand best  with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion  that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples hospitality  besides  he was an admirable poacher  and quoted for his skill in shooting  he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh which was particularly dangerous his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes he had professional aphorisms  which he inserted into his wife s mind the duty of the inn keeper  he said to her one day  violently  and in a low voice  is to sell to the first comer  stews  repose  light  fire dirty sheets  a servant  lice  and a smile  to stop passers by  to empty small purses  and to honestly lighten heavy ones  to shelter travelling families respectfully  to shave the man  to pluck the woman  to pick the child clean  to quote the window open  the window shut  the chimney corner  the arm chair  the chair  the ottoman  the stool  the feather bed  the mattress and the truss of straw  to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror  and to put a price on it  and  by five hundred thousand devils  to make the traveller pay for everything  even for the flies which his dog eats this man and this woman were ruse and rage wedded a hideous and terrible team while the husband pondered and combined  madame thenardier thought not of absent creditors  took no heed of yesterday nor of to morrow  and lived in a fit of anger  all in a minute such were these two beings  cosette was between them  subjected to their double pressure  like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers  the man and the woman each had a different method  cosette was overwhelmed with blows this was the woman s  she went barefooted in winter that was the man s doing cosette ran up stairs and down  washed  swept  rubbed  dusted  ran fluttered about  panted  moved heavy articles  and weak as she was did the coarse work  there was no mercy for her  a fierce mistress and venomous master  the thenardier hostelry was like a spider s web  in which cosette had been caught  and where she lay trembling  the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household  it was something like the fly serving the spiders the poor child passively held her peace what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god find themselves thus  at the very dawn of life  very small and in the midst of men all naked chapter iii men must have wine  and horses must have water four new travellers had arrived cosette was meditating sadly  for  although she was only eight years old  she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman  her eye was black in consequence of a blow from madame thenardier s fist  which caused the latter to remark from time to time  how ugly she is with her fist blow on her eye cosette was thinking that it was dark  very dark  that the pitchers and caraffes in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern she was somewhat reassured because no one in the thenardier establishment drank much water  thirsty people were never lacking there but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jug rather than to the pitcher  any one who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men  but there came a moment when the child trembled  madame thenardier raised the cover of a stew pan which was boiling on the stove  then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern  she turned the faucet  the child had raised her head and was following all the woman s movements  a thin stream of water trickled from the faucet  and half filled the glass well  said she  there is no more water  a momentary silence ensued the child did not breathe bah  resumed madame thenardier  examining the half filled glass  this will be enough cosette applied herself to her work once more  but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snow flake she counted the minutes that passed in this manner  and wished it were the next morning from time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street  and exclaimed  it s as black as an oven  or  one must needs be a cat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour  and cosette trembled all at once one of the pedlers who lodged in the hostelry entered  and said in a harsh voice my horse has not been watered yes  it has  said madame thenardier i tell you that it has not  retorted the pedler cosette had emerged from under the table oh  yes  sir  said she  the horse has had a drink  he drank out of a bucket  a whole bucketful  and it was i who took the water to him  and i spoke to him it was not true  cosette lied there s a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house exclaimed the pedler  i tell you that he has not been watered  you little jade  he has a way of blowing when he has had no water  which i know well cosette persisted  and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish and which was hardly audible and he drank heartily come  said the pedler  in a rage  this won t do at all  let my horse be watered  and let that be the end of it cosette crept under the table again in truth  that is fair  said madame thenardier  if the beast has not been watered  it must be then glancing about her well  now  where s that other beast she bent down and discovered cosette cowering at the other end of the table  almost under the drinkers  feet are you coming  shrieked madame thenardier cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself the thenardier resumed mademoiselle dog lack name  go and water that horse but  madame  said cosette  feebly  there is no water the thenardier threw the street door wide open well  go and get some  then cosette dropped her head  and went for an empty bucket which stood near the chimney corner this bucket was bigger than she was  and the child could have set down in it at her ease the thenardier returned to her stove  and tasted what was in the stewpan  with a wooden spoon  grumbling the while there s plenty in the spring  there never was such a malicious creature as that  i think i should have done better to strain my onions then she rummaged in a drawer which contained sous  pepper  and shallots see here  mam selle toad  she added  on your way back  you will get a big loaf from the baker  here s a fifteen sou piece cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron  she took the coin without saying a word  and put it in that pocket then she stood motionless  bucket in hand  the open door before her  she seemed to be waiting for some one to come to her rescue get along with you  screamed the thenardier cosette went out  the door closed behind her chapter iv entrance on the scene of a doll the line of open air booths starting at the church  extended  as the reader will remember  as far as the hostelry of the thenardiers  these booths were all illuminated  because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass  with candles burning in paper funnels which  as the schoolmaster  then seated at the table at the thenardiers observed  produced a magical effect  in compensation  not a star was visible in the sky the last of these stalls  established precisely opposite the thenardiers  door  was a toy shop all glittering with tinsel  glass and magnificent objects of tin  in the first row  and far forwards  the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins  an immense doll nearly two feet high  who was dressed in a robe of pink crepe  with gold wheat ears on her head  which had real hair and enamel eyes  all that day  this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passers by under ten years of age  without a mother being found in montfermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child eponine and azelma had passed hours in contemplating it  and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it  on the sly  it is true at the moment when cosette emerged  bucket in hand  melancholy and overcome as she was  she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll  towards the lady  as she called it  the poor child paused in amazement  she had not yet beheld that doll close to  the whole shop seemed a palace to her  the doll was not a doll  it was a vision  it was joy  splendor  riches  happiness  which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery  with the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood  cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll  she said to herself that one must be a queen  or at least a princess  to have a thing  like that  she gazed at that beautiful pink dress  that beautiful smooth hair  and she thought  how happy that doll must be  she could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall  the more she looked  the more dazzled she grew  she thought she was gazing at paradise  there were other dolls behind the large one  which seemed to her to be fairies and genii  the merchant  who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop  produced on her somewhat the effect of being the eternal father in this adoration she forgot everything  even the errand with which she was charged all at once the thenardier s coarse voice recalled her to reality what  you silly jade  you have not gone  wait  i ll give it to you  i want to know what you are doing there  get along  you little monster the thenardier had cast a glance into the street  and had caught sight of cosette in her ecstasy cosette fled  dragging her pail  and taking the longest strides of which she was capable chapter v the little one all alone as the thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is near the church  it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of chelles that cosette was obliged to go for her water she did not glance at the display of a single other merchant  so long as she was in boulanger lane and in the neighborhood of the church  the lighted stalls illuminated the road  but soon the last light from the last stall vanished  the poor child found herself in the dark  she plunged into it  only  as a certain emotion overcame her  she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along  this made a noise which afforded her company the further she went  the denser the darkness became  there was no one in the streets  however  she did encounter a woman  who turned around on seeing her  and stood still  muttering between her teeth  where can that child be going  is it a werewolf child  then the woman recognized cosette  well  said she  it s the lark in this manner cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of montfermeil on the side of chelles  so long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path  she proceeded with tolerable boldness  from time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter this was light and life  there were people there  and it reassured her  but in proportion as she advanced  her pace slackened mechanically  as it were  when she had passed the corner of the last house  cosette paused  it had been hard to advance further than the last stall  it became impossible to proceed further than the last house  she set her bucket on the ground  thrust her hand into her hair  and began slowly to scratch her head a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do  it was no longer montfermeil  it was the open fields  black and desert space was before her  she gazed in despair at that darkness  where there was no longer any one  where there were beasts  where there were spectres  possibly  she took a good look  and heard the beasts walking on the grass  and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees  then she seized her bucket again  fear had lent her audacity  bah  said she  i will tell him that there was no more water  and she resolutely re entered montfermeil hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again  now it was the thenardier who appeared to her  with her hideous  hyena mouth  and wrath flashing in her eyes  the child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her  what was she to do  what was to become of her  where was she to go  in front of her was the spectre of the thenardier  behind her all the phantoms of the night and of the forest  it was before the thenardier that she recoiled  she resumed her path to the spring  and began to run  she emerged from the village  she entered the forest at a run  no longer looking at or listening to anything  she only paused in her course when her breath failed her  but she did not halt in her advance  she went straight before her in desperation as she ran she felt like crying the nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely she no longer thought  she no longer saw  the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature  on the one hand  all shadow  on the other  an atom it was only seven or eight minutes  walk from the edge of the woods to the spring  cosette knew the way  through having gone over it many times in daylight  strange to say  she did not get lost  a remnant of instinct guided her vaguely  but she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left  for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood  in this manner she reached the spring it was a narrow  natural basin  hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil  about two feet deep  surrounded with moss and with those tall crimped grasses which are called henry iv s frills  and paved with several large stones  a brook ran out of it  with a tranquil little noise cosette did not take time to breathe  it was very dark  but she was in the habit of coming to this spring  she felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring  and which usually served to support her  found one of its branches  clung to it  bent down  and plunged the bucket in the water  she was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled  while thus bent over she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring  the fifteen sou piece fell into the water  cosette neither saw nor heard it fall  she drew out the bucket nearly full  and set it on the grass that done  she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue  she would have liked to set out again at once  but the effort required to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step  she was forced to sit down  she dropped on the grass  and remained crouching there she shut her eyes  then she opened them again  without knowing why  but because she could not do otherwise  the agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds  which were like masses of smoke  the tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the child jupiter was setting in the depths the child stared with bewildered eyes at this great star  with which she was unfamiliar  and which terrified her  the planet was  in fact  very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of mist which imparted to it a horrible ruddy hue  the mist  gloomily empurpled  magnified the star  one would have called it a luminous wound a cold wind was blowing from the plain  the forest was dark  not a leaf was moving  there were none of the vague  fresh gleams of summertide great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise  slender and misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings  the tall grasses undulated like eels under the north wind  the nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of prey  some bits of dry heather  tossed by the breeze  flew rapidly by  and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after  on all sides there were lugubrious stretches the darkness was bewildering  man requires light  whoever buries himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract  when the eye sees black  the heart sees trouble  in an eclipse in the night  in the sooty opacity  there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts  no one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling  shadows and trees two formidable densities  a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths  the inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness  one beholds floating  either in space or in one s own brain  one knows not what vague and intangible thing  like the dreams of sleeping flowers  there are fierce attitudes on the horizon one inhales the effluvia of the great black void  one is afraid to glance behind him  yet desirous of doing so  the cavities of night things grown haggard  taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances obscure dishevelments  irritated tufts  livid pools  the lugubrious reflected in the funereal  the sepulchral immensity of silence  unknown but possible beings  bendings of mysterious branches  alarming torsos of trees  long handfuls of quivering plants against all this one has no protection  there is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish  one is conscious of something hideous as though one s soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness  this penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child forests are apocalypses  and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault without understanding her sensations  cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature  it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her  it was something more terrible even than terror  she shivered  there are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart  her eye grew wild  she thought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow then  by a sort of instinct  she began to count aloud  one  two  three four  and so on up to ten  in order to escape from that singular state which she did not understand  but which terrified her  and  when she had finished  she began again  this restored her to a true perception of the things about her  her hands  which she had wet in drawing the water felt cold  she rose  her terror  a natural and unconquerable terror  had returned  she had but one thought now to flee at full speed through the forest  across the fields to the houses  to the windows  to the lighted candles  her glance fell upon the water which stood before her such was the fright which the thenardier inspired in her  that she dared not flee without that bucket of water  she seized the handle with both hands  she could hardly lift the pail in this manner she advanced a dozen paces  but the bucket was full  it was heavy  she was forced to set it on the ground once more  she took breath for an instant  then lifted the handle of the bucket again  and resumed her march  proceeding a little further this time  but again she was obliged to pause  after some seconds of repose she set out again she walked bent forward  with drooping head  like an old woman  the weight of the bucket strained and stiffened her thin arms  the iron handle completed the benumbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands she was forced to halt from time to time  and each time that she did so the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs  this took place in the depths of a forest  at night  in winter  far from all human sight  she was a child of eight  no one but god saw that sad thing at the moment and her mother  no doubt  alas for there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves she panted with a sort of painful rattle  sobs contracted her throat but she dared not weep  so afraid was she of the thenardier  even at a distance  it was her custom to imagine the thenardier always present however  she could not make much headway in that manner  and she went on very slowly  in spite of diminishing the length of her stops  and of walking as long as possible between them  she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to montfermeil in this manner  and that the thenardier would beat her  this anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night  she was worn out with fatigue  and had not yet emerged from the forest  on arriving near an old chestnut tree with which she was acquainted  made a last halt  longer than the rest  in order that she might get well rested  then she summoned up all her strength  picked up her bucket again  and courageously resumed her march  but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from crying  o my god  my god at that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything at all  a hand  which seemed to her enormous  had just seized the handle  and lifted it vigorously  she raised her head  a large black form  straight and erect  was walking beside her through the darkness  it was a man who had come up behind her  and whose approach she had not heard  this man  without uttering a word  had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying there are instincts for all the encounters of life the child was not afraid chapter vi which possibly proves boulatruelle s intelligence on the afternoon of that same christmas day   a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard de l hopital in paris  this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings  and he seemed to halt  by preference  at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg saint marceau we shall see further on that this man had  in fact  hired a chamber in that isolated quarter this man  in his attire  as in all his person  realized the type of what may be called the well bred mendicant extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness  this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor  and for the man who is very worthy  he wore a very old and very well brushed round hat  a coarse coat  worn perfectly threadbare  of an ochre yellow  a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch  a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut  black breeches  worn gray at the knee  stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles  he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family  returned from the emigration  he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age  from his perfectly white hair  his wrinkled brow  his livid lips  and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life  judging from his firm tread  from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty  the wrinkles on his brow were well placed  and would have disposed in his favor any one who observed him attentively  his lip contracted with a strange fold which seemed severe  and which was humble  there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity  in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief  in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel  cut from some hedge  this stick had been carefully trimmed  and had an air that was not too threatening  the most had been made of its knots  and it had received a coral like head  made from red wax  it was a cudgel  and it seemed to be a cane there are but few passers by on that boulevard  particularly in the winter  the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them  but this without any affectation at that epoch  king louis xviii  went nearly every day to choisy le roi it was one of his favorite excursions  towards two o clock  almost invariably  the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard de l hopital this served in lieu of a watch or clock to the poor women of the quarter who said  it is two o clock  there he is returning to the tuileries and some rushed forward  and others drew up in line  for a passing king always creates a tumult  besides  the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii  produced a certain effect in the streets of paris  it was rapid but majestic  this impotent king had a taste for a fast gallop as he was not able to walk  he wished to run  that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning  he passed  pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords  his massive coach  all covered with gilding  with great branches of lilies painted on the panels  thundered noisily along  there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it  in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large  firm  and ruddy face  a brow freshly powdered a l oiseau royal  a proud  hard  crafty eye  the smile of an educated man  two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat  the golden fleece  the cross of saint louis  the cross of the legion of honor  the silver plaque of the saint esprit  a huge belly  and a wide blue ribbon  it was the king  outside of paris  he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees enwrapped in high english gaiters  when he re entered the city  he put on his hat and saluted rarely  he stared coldly at the people  and they returned it in kind when he appeared for the first time in the saint marceau quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade  that big fellow yonder is the government this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was  therefore  the daily event of the boulevard de l hopital the promenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter  and probably did not belong in paris  for he was ignorant as to this detail  when  at two o clock  the royal carriage  surrounded by a squadron of the body guard all covered with silver lace  debouched on the boulevard  after having made the turn of the salpetriere  he appeared surprised and almost alarmed  there was no one but himself in this cross lane  he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure  though this did not prevent m  le duc de havre from spying him out m  le duc de havre  as captain of the guard on duty that day  was seated in the carriage  opposite the king  he said to his majesty  yonder is an evil looking man  members of the police  who were clearing the king s route  took equal note of him  one of them received an order to follow him  but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg  and as twilight was beginning to fall  the agent lost trace of him  as is stated in a report addressed that same evening to m  le comte d angles  minister of state  prefect of police when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent off his track he redoubled his pace  not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed  at a quarter past four  that is to say  when night was fully come  he passed in front of the theatre of the porte saint martin  where the two convicts was being played that day  this poster  illuminated by the theatre lanterns  struck him  for although he was walking rapidly  he halted to read it  an instant later he was in the blind alley of la planchette  and he entered the plat d etain the pewter platter  where the office of the coach for lagny was then situated  this coach set out at half past four  the horses were harnessed  and the travellers  summoned by the coachman  were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle the man inquired have you a place only one beside me on the box  said the coachman i will take it climb up nevertheless  before setting out  the coachman cast a glance at the traveller s shabby dress  at the diminutive size of his bundle  and made him pay his fare are you going as far as lagny  demanded the coachman yes  said the man the traveller paid to lagny they started  when they had passed the barrier  the coachman tried to enter into conversation  but the traveller only replied in monosyllables  the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak  it was cold  the man did not appear to be thinking of that  thus they passed gournay and neuilly sur marne towards six o clock in the evening they reached chelles  the coachman drew up in front of the carters  inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey  to give his horses a breathing spell i get down here  said the man he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle an instant later he had disappeared he did not enter the inn when the coach set out for lagny a few minutes later  it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles the coachman turned to the inside travellers there  said he  is a man who does not belong here  for i do not know him  he had not the air of owning a sou  but he does not consider money he pays to lagny  and he goes only as far as chelles  it is night  all the houses are shut  he does not enter the inn  and he is not to be found  so he has dived through the earth the man had not plunged into the earth  but he had gone with great strides through the dark  down the principal street of chelles  then he had turned to the right before reaching the church  into the cross road leading to montfermeil  like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before he followed this road rapidly  at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree bordered road which runs from gagny to lagny  he heard people coming  he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch  and there waited until the passers by were at a distance  the precaution was nearly superfluous  however  for  as we have already said  it was a very dark december night  not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky it is at this point that the ascent of the hill begins  the man did not return to the road to montfermeil  he struck across the fields to the right  and entered the forest with long strides once in the forest he slackened his pace  and began a careful examination of all the trees  advancing  step by step  as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone  there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself  and he paused in indecision  at last he arrived  by dint of feeling his way inch by inch  at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones  he stepped up briskly to these stones  and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review  a large tree  covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation  stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones  he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk  as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts opposite this tree  which was an ash  there was a chestnut tree suffering from a peeling of the bark  to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing  he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc then he trod about for awhile on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones  like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed that done  he took his bearings  and resumed his march through the forest it was the man who had just met cosette as he walked through the thicket in the direction of montfermeil  he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan  depositing a burden on the ground  then taking it up and setting out again  he drew near  and perceived that it was a very young child  laden with an enormous bucket of water  then he approached the child  and silently grasped the handle of the bucket chapter vii cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark cosette  as we have said  was not frightened the man accosted her  he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass my child  what you are carrying is very heavy for you cosette raised her head and replied yes  sir give it to me  said the man  i will carry it for you cosette let go of the bucket handle  the man walked along beside her it really is very heavy  he muttered between his teeth  then he added how old are you  little one eight  sir and have you come from far like this from the spring in the forest are you going far a good quarter of an hour s walk from here the man said nothing for a moment  then he remarked abruptly so you have no mother i don t know  answered the child before the man had time to speak again  she added i don t think so  other people have mothers  i have none and after a silence she went on i think that i never had any the man halted  he set the bucket on the ground  bent down and placed both hands on the child s shoulders  making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark cosette s thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky what is your name  said the man cosette the man seemed to have received an electric shock  he looked at her once more  then he removed his hands from cosette s shoulders  seized the bucket  and set out again after a moment he inquired where do you live  little one at montfermeil  if you know where that is that is where we are going yes  sir he paused  then began again who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest it was madame thenardier the man resumed  in a voice which he strove to render indifferent  but in which there was  nevertheless  a singular tremor what does your madame thenardier do she is my mistress  said the child  she keeps the inn the inn  said the man  well  i am going to lodge there to night  show me the way we are on the way there  said the child the man walked tolerably fast  cosette followed him without difficulty she no longer felt any fatigue  from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man  with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence  she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless  she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy  and which mounted towards heaven several minutes elapsed  the man resumed is there no servant in madame thenardier s house no  sir are you alone there yes  sir another pause ensued  cosette lifted up her voice that is to say  there are two little girls what little girls ponine and zelma this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier who are ponine and zelma they are madame thenardier s young ladies  her daughters  as you would say and what do those girls do oh  said the child  they have beautiful dolls  things with gold in them  all full of affairs  they play  they amuse themselves all day long yes  sir and you i  i work all day long the child raised her great eyes  in which hung a tear  which was not visible because of the darkness  and replied gently yes  sir after an interval of silence she went on sometimes  when i have finished my work and they let me  i amuse myself  too how do you amuse yourself in the best way i can  they let me alone  but i have not many playthings  ponine and zelma will not let me play with their dolls  i have only a little lead sword  no longer than that the child held up her tiny finger and it will not cut yes  sir  said the child  it cuts salad and the heads of flies they reached the village  cosette guided the stranger through the streets  they passed the bakeshop  but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch  the man had ceased to ply her with questions  and now preserved a gloomy silence when they had left the church behind them  the man  on perceiving all the open air booths  asked cosette so there is a fair going on here no  sir  it is christmas as they approached the tavern  cosette timidly touched his arm monsieur what  my child we are quite near the house well will you let me take my bucket now why if madame sees that some one has carried it for me  she will beat me the man handed her the bucket  an instant later they were at the tavern door chapter viii the unpleasantness of receiving into one s house a poor man who may be a rich man cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll  which was still displayed at the toy merchant s  then she knocked the door opened  the thenardier appeared with a candle in her hand ah  so it s you  you little wretch  good mercy  but you ve taken your time  the hussy has been amusing herself madame  said cosette  trembling all over  here s a gentleman who wants a lodging the thenardier speedily replaced her gruff air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to tavern keepers  and eagerly sought the new comer with her eyes this is the gentleman  said she yes  madame  replied the man  raising his hand to his hat wealthy travellers are not so polite  this gesture  and an inspection of the stranger s costume and baggage  which the thenardier passed in review with one glance  caused the amiable grimace to vanish  and the gruff mien to reappear  she resumed dryly enter  my good man the good man  entered  the thenardier cast a second glance at him  paid particular attention to his frock coat  which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat  which was a little battered  and  tossing her head wrinkling her nose  and screwing up her eyes  she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters  the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger  which  backed up by an inflation of the lips  signifies in such cases  a regular beggar thereupon  the thenardier exclaimed ah  see here  my good man  i am very sorry  but i have no room left put me where you like  said the man  in the attic  in the stable  i will pay as though i occupied a room forty sous forty sous  agreed very well  then forty sous  said a carter  in a low tone  to the thenardier woman why  the charge is only twenty sous it is forty in his case  retorted the thenardier  in the same tone  i don t lodge poor folks for less that s true  added her husband  gently  it ruins a house to have such people in it in the meantime  the man  laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table  on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass  the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself  cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table  and her knitting the man  who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself  observed the child with peculiar attention cosette was ugly  if she had been happy  she might have been pretty  we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure  cosette was thin and pale  she was nearly eight years old  but she seemed to be hardly six  her large eyes  sunken in a sort of shadow  were almost put out with weeping  the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people her hands were  as her mother had divined  ruined with chilblains  the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones  and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent as she was always shivering  she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other  her entire clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer  and which inspired horror in winter all she had on was hole ridden linen  not a scrap of woollen  her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried  which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her  her naked legs were thin and red  the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep  this child s whole person  her mien  her attitude  the sound of her voice  the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next  her glance  her silence  her slightest gesture  expressed and betrayed one sole idea fear fear was diffused all over her  she was covered with it  so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips  withdrew her heels under her petticoat  made her occupy as little space as possible  allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary  and had become what might be called the habit of her body  admitting of no possible variation except an increase  in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished nook where terror lurked her fear was such  that on her arrival  wet as she was  cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself  but sat silently down to her work again the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy  and at times so tragic  that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon as we have stated  she had never known what it is to pray  she had never set foot in a church  have i the time  said the thenardier the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette all at once  the thenardier exclaimed by the way  where s that bread cosette  according to her custom whenever the thenardier uplifted her voice  emerged with great haste from beneath the table she had completely forgotten the bread  she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear  she lied madame  the baker s shop was shut you should have knocked i did knock  madame well he did not open the door i ll find out to morrow whether that is true  said the thenardier and if you are telling me a lie  i ll lead you a pretty dance  in the meantime  give me back my fifteen sou piece cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron  and turned green the fifteen sou piece was not there ah  come now  said madame thenardier  did you hear me cosette turned her pocket inside out  there was nothing in it  what could have become of that money  the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say  she was petrified have you lost that fifteen sou piece  screamed the thenardier hoarsely  or do you want to rob me of it at the same time  she stretched out her arm towards the cat o nine tails which hung on a nail in the chimney corner this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek mercy  madame  madame  i will not do so any more the thenardier took down the whip in the meantime  the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat  without any one having noticed his movements  besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards  and were not paying attention to anything cosette contracted herself into a ball  with anguish  within the angle of the chimney  endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude limbs  the thenardier raised her arm pardon me  madame  said the man  but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one s apron pocket  and rolled aside  perhaps this is it at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment exactly  here it is  he went on  straightening himself up and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier yes  that s it  said she it was not it  for it was a twenty sou piece  but the thenardier found it to her advantage  she put the coin in her pocket  and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child  accompanied with the remark  don t let this ever happen again cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel  and her large eyes  which were riveted on the traveller  began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before  thus far it was only an innocent amazement  but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it by the way  would you like some supper  the thenardier inquired of the traveller he made no reply  he appeared to be absorbed in thought what sort of a man is that  she muttered between her teeth  he s some frightfully poor wretch  he hasn t a sou to pay for a supper  will he even pay me for his lodging  it s very lucky  all the same  that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor in the meantime  a door had opened  and eponine and azelma entered they were two really pretty little girls  more bourgeois than peasant in looks  and very charming  the one with shining chestnut tresses the other with long black braids hanging down her back  both vivacious neat  plump  rosy  and healthy  and a delight to the eye  they were warmly clad  but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement  there was a hint of winter  though the springtime was not wholly effaced  light emanated from these two little beings  besides this  they were on the throne  in their toilettes  in their gayety  in the noise which they made  there was sovereignty  when they entered  the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration  ah  there you are  you children then drawing them  one after the other to her knees  smoothing their hair  tying their ribbons afresh  and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers  she exclaimed  what frights they are they went and seated themselves in the chimney corner  they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter  from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air eponine and azelma did not look at cosette  she was the same as a dog to them  these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them  but they already represented the whole society of man  envy on the one side  disdain on the other the doll of the thenardier sisters was very much faded  very old  and much broken  but it seemed none the less admirable to cosette  who had never had a doll in her life  a real doll  to make use of the expression which all children will understand all at once  the thenardier  who had been going back and forth in the room  perceived that cosette s mind was distracted  and that  instead of working  she was paying attention to the little ones at their play ah  i ve caught you at it  she cried  so that s the way you work i ll make you work to the tune of the whip  that i will the stranger turned to the thenardier  without quitting his chair bah  madame  he said  with an almost timid air  let her play such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper  and who had not the air of being frightfully poor  would have been equivalent to an order  but that a man with such a hat should permit himself such a desire  and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will  was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate she retorted with acrimony she must work  since she eats  i don t feed her to do nothing what is she making  went on the stranger  in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter s shoulders the thenardier deigned to reply stockings  if you please  stockings for my little girls  who have none so to speak  and who are absolutely barefoot just now the man looked at cosette s poor little red feet  and continued when will she have finished this pair of stockings she has at least three or four good days  work on them still  the lazy creature and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him thirty sous at least will you sell them for five francs  went on the man good heavens  exclaimed a carter who was listening  with a loud laugh five francs  the deuce  i should think so  five balls thenardier thought it time to strike in yes  sir  if such is your fancy  you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five francs  we can refuse nothing to travellers you must pay on the spot  said the thenardier  in her curt and peremptory fashion i will buy that pair of stockings  replied the man  and  he added drawing a five franc piece from his pocket  and laying it on the table i will pay for them then he turned to cosette now i own your work  play  my child the carter was so much touched by the five franc piece  that he abandoned his glass and hastened up but it s true  he cried  examining it  a real hind wheel  and not counterfeit thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket the thenardier had no reply to make  she bit her lips  and her face assumed an expression of hatred in the meantime  cosette was trembling  she ventured to ask is it true  madame  may i play play  said the thenardier  in a terrible voice thanks  madame  said cosette and while her mouth thanked the thenardier  her whole little soul thanked the traveller thenardier had resumed his drinking  his wife whispered in his ear who can this yellow man be i have seen millionaires with coats like that  replied thenardier  in a sovereign manner cosette had dropped her knitting  but had not left her seat  cosette always moved as little as possible  she picked up some old rags and her little lead sword from a box behind her eponine and azelma paid no attention to what was going on  they had just executed a very important operation  they had just got hold of the cat  they had thrown their doll on the ground  and eponine  who was the elder  was swathing the little cat  in spite of its mewing and its contortions  in a quantity of clothes and red and blue scraps  while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children  whose grace  like the splendor of the butterfly s wing  vanishes when one essays to fix it fast you see  sister  this doll is more amusing than the other  she twists she cries  she is warm  see  sister  let us play with her  she shall be my little girl  i will be a lady  i will come to see you  and you shall look at her  gradually  you will perceive her whiskers  and that will surprise you  and then you will see her ears  and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you  and you will say to me  ah  mon dieu  and i will say to you  yes  madame  it is my little girl  little girls are made like that just at present azelma listened admiringly to eponine in the meantime  the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song  and to laugh at it until the ceiling shook  thenardier accompanied and encouraged them as birds make nests out of everything  so children make a doll out of anything which comes to hand  while eponine and azelma were bundling up the cat  cosette  on her side  had dressed up her sword  that done  she laid it in her arms  and sang to it softly  to lull it to sleep the doll is one of the most imperious needs and  at the same time  one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood  to care for  to clothe  to deck  to dress  to undress  to redress  to teach  scold a little  to rock  to dandle  to lull to sleep  to imagine that something is some one therein lies the whole woman s future  while dreaming and chattering  making tiny outfits  and baby clothes  while sewing little gowns  and corsages and bodices  the child grows into a young girl  the young girl into a big girl  the big girl into a woman  the first child is the continuation of the last doll a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy  and quite as impossible  as a woman without children so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword madame thenardier approached the yellow man  my husband is right  she thought  perhaps it is m  laffitte  there are such queer rich men she came and set her elbows on the table monsieur  said she  at this word  monsieur  the man turned  up to that time  the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bonhomme you see  sir  she pursued  assuming a sweetish air that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien  i am willing that the child should play  i do not oppose it  but it is good for once  because you are generous  you see  she has nothing  she must needs work then this child is not yours  demanded the man oh  mon dieu  no  sir  she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity  a sort of imbecile child  she must have water on the brain  she has a large head  as you see  we do what we can for her  for we are not rich  we have written in vain to her native place  and have received no reply these six months  it must be that her mother is dead ah  said the man  and fell into his revery once more her mother didn t amount to much  added the thenardier  she abandoned her child during the whole of this conversation cosette  as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion  had not taken her eyes from the thenardier s face  she listened vaguely  she caught a few words here and there meanwhile  the drinkers  all three quarters intoxicated  were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety  it was a highly spiced and wanton song  in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter  cosette from her post under the table  gazed at the fire  which was reflected from her fixed eyes  she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made  and  as she rocked it  she sang in a low voice  my mother is dead  my mother is dead  my mother is dead on being urged afresh by the hostess  the yellow man  the millionaire consented at last to take supper what does monsieur wish bread and cheese  said the man decidedly  he is a beggar  thought madame thenardier the drunken men were still singing their song  and the child under the table was singing hers all at once  cosette paused  she had just turned round and caught sight of the little thenardiers  doll  which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table then she dropped the swaddled sword  which only half met her needs  and cast her eyes slowly round the room  madame thenardier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money  ponine and zelma were playing with the cat  the travellers were eating or drinking or singing  not a glance was fixed on her  she had not a moment to lose  she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees  made sure once more that no one was watching her  then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it  an instant later she was in her place again  seated motionless  and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms  the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness no one had seen her  except the traveller  who was slowly devouring his meagre supper this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll s legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly  that pink and shining foot  projecting from the shadow  suddenly struck the eye of azelma  who said to eponine look  sister the two little girls paused in stupefaction  cosette had dared to take their doll eponine rose  and  without releasing the cat  she ran to her mother  and began to tug at her skirt let me alone  said her mother  what do you want mother  said the child  look there and she pointed to cosette cosette  absorbed in the ecstasies of possession  no longer saw or heard anything madame thenardier s countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life  and which has caused this style of woman to be named megaeras on this occasion  wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further cosette had overstepped all bounds  cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies  a czarina who should see a muzhik trying on her imperial son s blue ribbon would wear no other face she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation cosette cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her  she turned round cosette  repeated the thenardier cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration  mingled with despair  then  without taking her eyes from it  she clasped her hands  and  what is terrible to relate of a child of that age  she wrung them  then not one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest  nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money  nor the sight of the whip  nor even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept  she burst out sobbing meanwhile  the traveller had risen to his feet what is the matter  he said to the thenardier don t you see  said the thenardier  pointing to the corpus delicti which lay at cosette s feet well  what of it  resumed the man that beggar  replied the thenardier  has permitted herself to touch the children s doll all this noise for that  said the man  well  what if she did play with that doll she touched it with her dirty hands  pursued the thenardier  with her frightful hands here cosette redoubled her sobs will you stop your noise  screamed the thenardier the man went straight to the street door  opened it  and stepped out as soon as he had gone  the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table  which made the child utter loud cries the door opened again  the man re appeared  he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned  and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning  and he set it upright in front of cosette  saying here  this is for you it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revery of that toy shop  lighted up by fire pots and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop cosette raised her eyes  she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun  she heard the unprecedented words  it is for you  she stared at him  she stared at the doll  then she slowly retreated  and hid herself at the extreme end  under the table in a corner of the wall she no longer cried  she no longer wept  she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe the thenardier  eponine  and azelma were like statues also  the very drinkers had paused  a solemn silence reigned through the whole room madame thenardier  petrified and mute  recommenced her conjectures  who is that old fellow  is he a poor man  is he a millionaire  perhaps he is both  that is to say  a thief the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force  the tavern keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller  he seemed to be scenting out the man  as he would have scented out a bag of money  this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning  he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice that machine costs at least thirty francs  no nonsense  down on your belly before that man gross natures have this in common with naive natures  that they possess no transition state well  cosette  said the thenardier  in a voice that strove to be sweet  and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women aren t you going to take your doll cosette ventured to emerge from her hole the gentleman has given you a doll  my little cosette  said thenardier  with a caressing air  take it  it is yours cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror  her face was still flooded with tears  but her eyes began to fill  like the sky at daybreak  with strange beams of joy  what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one  you are the queen of france it seemed to her that if she touched that doll  lightning would dart from it this was true  up to a certain point  for she said to herself that the thenardier would scold and beat her nevertheless  the attraction carried the day  she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier may i  madame no words can render that air  at once despairing  terrified  and ecstatic pardi  cried the thenardier  it is yours  the gentleman has given it to you truly  sir  said cosette  is it true  is the lady  mine the stranger s eyes seemed to be full of tears  he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should weep  he nodded to cosette  and placed the lady s  hand in her tiny hand cosette hastily withdrew her hand  as though that of the lady  scorched her  and began to stare at the floor  we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately  all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport i shall call her catherine  she said it was an odd moment when cosette s rags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslins of the doll madame  she resumed  may i put her on a chair yes  my child  replied the thenardier it was now the turn of eponine and azelma to gaze at cosette with envy cosette placed catherine on a chair  then seated herself on the floor in front of her  and remained motionless  without uttering a word  in an attitude of contemplation play  cosette  said the stranger oh  i am playing  returned the child this stranger  this unknown individual  who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette  was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than any one in the world at that moment  however  it was necessary to control herself  habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions  these emotions were more than she could endure  she made haste to send her daughters to bed  then she asked the man s permission to send cosette off also  for she has worked hard all day  she added with a maternal air  cosette went off to bed  carrying catherine in her arms from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was  to relieve her soul  as she said  she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more furious because she dared not utter them aloud old beast  what has he got in his belly  to come and upset us in this manner  to want that little monster to play  to give away forty franc dolls to a jade that i would sell for forty sous  so i would  a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her  as though to the duchess de berry  is there any sense in it  is he mad  then  that mysterious old fellow why  it is perfectly simple  replied thenardier  if that amuses him it amuses you to have the little one work  it amuses him to have her play  he s all right  a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it  if the old fellow is a philanthropist  what is that to you  if he is an imbecile  it does not concern you  what are you worrying for so long as he has money the language of a master  and the reasoning of an innkeeper  neither of which admitted of any reply the man had placed his elbows on the table  and resumed his thoughtful attitude  all the other travellers  both pedlers and carters  had withdrawn a little  and had ceased singing  they were staring at him from a distance  with a sort of respectful awe  this poorly dressed man  who drew hind wheels  from his pocket with so much ease  and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little brats in wooden shoes  was certainly a magnificent fellow  and one to be feared many hours passed  the midnight mass was over  the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure  the drinking shop was closed the public room was deserted  the fire extinct  the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude  from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned  that was all  but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room the thenardiers alone  out of politeness and curiosity  had remained in the room is he going to pass the night in that fashion  grumbled the thenardier  when two o clock in the morning struck  she declared herself vanquished  and said to her husband  i m going to bed  do as you like her husband seated himself at a table in the corner  lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais a good hour passed thus  the worthy inn keeper had perused the courrier francais at least three times  from the date of the number to the printer s name  the stranger did not stir thenardier fidgeted  coughed  spit  blew his nose  and creaked his chair  not a movement on the man s part  is he asleep  thought thenardier  the man was not asleep  but nothing could arouse him at last thenardier took off his cap  stepped gently up to him  and ventured to say is not monsieur going to his repose not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar  to repose smacked of luxury and respect  these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day  a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sous  a chamber in which one reposes costs twenty francs well  said the stranger  you are right  where is your stable sir  exclaimed thenardier  with a smile  i will conduct you  sir he took the candle  the man picked up his bundle and cudgel  and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor  which was of rare splendor  all furnished in mahogany  with a low bedstead  curtained with red calico what is this  said the traveller it is really our bridal chamber  said the tavern keeper  my wife and i occupy another  this is only entered three or four times a year i should have liked the stable quite as well  said the man  abruptly thenardier pretended not to hear this unamiable remark he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figured on the chimney piece  a very good fire was flickering on the hearth on the chimney piece  under a glass globe  stood a woman s head dress in silver wire and orange flowers and what is this  resumed the stranger that  sir  said thenardier  is my wife s wedding bonnet the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time  then  when that monster was a maiden thenardier lied  however  when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern  he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner  and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand  with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse  and would result in what the english call respectability for his house when the traveller turned round  the host had disappeared  thenardier had withdrawn discreetly  without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning the inn keeper retired to his room  his wife was in bed  but she was not asleep  when she heard her husband s step she turned over and said to him do you know  i m going to turn cosette out of doors to morrow thenardier replied coldly how you do go on they exchanged no further words  and a few moments later their candle was extinguished as for the traveller  he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner  the landlord once gone  he threw himself into an arm chair and remained for some time buried in thought  then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles  blew out the other  opened the door  and quitted the room  gazing about him like a person who is in search of something  he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase  there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child  he followed this sound  and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase  or rather formed by the staircase itself  this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps  there  in the midst of all sorts of old papers and potsherds  among dust and spiders  webs  was a bed if one can call by the name of bed a straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw  and a coverlet so tattered as to show the pallet  no sheets  this was placed on the floor in this bed cosette was sleeping the man approached and gazed down upon her cosette was in a profound sleep  she was fully dressed  in the winter she did not undress  in order that she might not be so cold against her breast was pressed the doll  whose large eyes  wide open glittered in the dark  from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking  and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms  beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes a door which stood open near cosette s pallet permitted a view of a rather large  dark room  the stranger stepped into it  at the further extremity  through a glass door  he saw two small  very white beds they belonged to eponine and azelma  behind these beds  and half hidden stood an uncurtained wicker cradle  in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair  he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all  and which are so cold to look at  there was no fire in this one  there was not even ashes  but there was something which attracted the stranger s gaze nevertheless  it was two tiny children s shoes  coquettish in shape and unequal in size  the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve  there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy  eponine and azelma had taken care not to omit this  and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth the traveller bent over them the fairy  that is to say  their mother  had already paid her visit  and in each he saw a brand new and shining ten sou piece the man straightened himself up  and was on the point of withdrawing when far in  in the darkest corner of the hearth  he caught sight of another object  he looked at it  and recognized a wooden shoe  a frightful shoe of the coarsest description  half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mud  it was cosette s sabot  cosette  with that touching trust of childhood  which can always be deceived yet never discouraged  had placed her shoe on the hearth stone also hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing there was nothing in this wooden shoe the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat  bent over and placed a louis d or in cosette s shoe then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf chapter ix thenardier and his manoeuvres on the following morning  two hours at least before day break thenardier  seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern  pen in hand  was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat his wife  standing beside him  and half bent over him  was following him with her eyes  they exchanged not a word  on the one hand  there was profound meditation  on the other  the religious admiration with which one watches the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind  a noise was audible in the house  it was the lark sweeping the stairs after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour  and some erasures thenardier produced the following masterpiece           bill of the gentleman in no    supper                     francs   chamber                        candle                         fire                          service                                                                                      total           francs service was written servisse twenty three francs  cried the woman  with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation like all great artists  thenardier was dissatisfied peuh  he exclaimed it was the accent of castlereagh auditing france s bill at the congress of vienna monsieur thenardier  you are right  he certainly owes that  murmured the wife  who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters  it is just  but it is too much  he will not pay it thenardier laughed coldly  as usual  and said he will pay this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority  that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so  his wife did not insist she set about arranging the table  her husband paced the room  a moment later he added i owe full fifteen hundred francs he went and seated himself in the chimney corner  meditating  with his feet among the warm ashes ah  by the way  resumed his wife  you don t forget that i m going to turn cosette out of doors to day  the monster  she breaks my heart with that doll of hers  i d rather marry louis xviii  than keep her another day in the house thenardier lighted his pipe  and replied between two puffs you will hand that bill to the man then he went out hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half open door  visible only to his wife the yellow man carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand up so early  said madame thenardier  is monsieur leaving us already as she spoke thus  she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air  and making creases in it with her nails  her hard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch  seemed difficult to her the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent minded  he replied yes  madame  i am going so monsieur has no business in montfermeil no  i was passing through  that is all  what do i owe you  madame  he added the thenardier silently handed him the folded bill the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it  but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere madame  he resumed  is business good here in montfermeil so so  monsieur  replied the thenardier  stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion she continued  in a dreary and lamentable tone oh  monsieur  times are so hard  and then  we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood  all the people are poor  you see  if we had not  now and then  some rich and generous travellers like monsieur  we should not get along at all  we have so many expenses  just see  that child is costing us our very eyes what child why  the little one  you know  cosette the lark  as she is called hereabouts ah  said the man she went on how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames  she has more the air of a bat than of a lark  you see  sir  we do not ask charity  and we cannot bestow it  we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal the license  the imposts  the door and window tax  the hundredths monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money and then  i have my daughters  i have no need to bring up other people s children the man resumed  in that voice which he strove to render indifferent and in which there lingered a tremor what if one were to rid you of her who  cosette yes the landlady s red and violent face brightened up hideously ah  sir  my dear sir  take her  keep her  lead her off  carry her away  sugar her  stuff her with truffles  drink her  eat her  and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you agreed really  you will take her away i will take her away immediately immediately  call the child cosette  screamed the thenardier in the meantime  pursued the man  i will pay you what i owe you  how much is it he cast a glance on the bill  and could not restrain a start of surprise twenty three francs he looked at the landlady  and repeated twenty three francs there was in the enunciation of these words  thus repeated  an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the shock  she replied  with assurance good gracious  yes  sir  it is twenty three francs the stranger laid five five franc pieces on the table go and get the child  said he at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room  and said monsieur owes twenty six sous twenty six sous  exclaimed his wife twenty sous for the chamber  resumed thenardier  coldly  and six sous for his supper  as for the child  i must discuss that matter a little with the gentleman  leave us  wife madame thenardier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent  she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage  uttered not a word in reply  and left the room as soon as they were alone  thenardier offered the traveller a chair the traveller seated himself  thenardier remained standing  and his face assumed a singular expression of good fellowship and simplicity sir  said he  what i have to say to you is this  that i adore that child the stranger gazed intently at him what child thenardier continued how strange it is  one grows attached  what money is that  take back your hundred sou piece  i adore the child whom do you mean  demanded the stranger eh  our little cosette  are you not intending to take her away from us  well  i speak frankly  as true as you are an honest man  i will not consent to it  i shall miss that child  i saw her first when she was a tiny thing  it is true that she costs us money  it is true that she has her faults  it is true that we are not rich  it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one of her illnesses but one must do something for the good god s sake  she has neither father nor mother  i have brought her up  i have bread enough for her and for myself  in truth  i think a great deal of that child  you understand  one conceives an affection for a person  i am a good sort of a beast  i am  i do not reason  i love that little girl  my wife is quick tempered  but she loves her also  you see  she is just the same as our own child  i want to keep her to babble about the house the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on thenardier  the latter continued excuse me  sir  but one does not give away one s child to a passer by like that  i am right  am i not  still  i don t say you are rich  you have the air of a very good man if it were for her happiness  but one must find out that  you understand  suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself  i should like to know what becomes of her  i should not wish to lose sight of her  i should like to know with whom she is living  so that i could go to see her from time to time  so that she may know that her good foster father is alive  that he is watching over her  in short  there are things which are not possible  i do not even know your name  if you were to take her away  i should say  well and the lark  what has become of her  one must  at least  see some petty scrap of paper  some trifle in the way of a passport  you know the stranger  still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates  as the saying goes  to the very depths of the conscience  replied in a grave  firm voice monsieur thenardier  one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris  if i take cosette away  i shall take her away  and that is the end of the matter  you will not know my name  you will not know my residence  you will not know where she is  and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives  i break the thread which binds her foot  and she departs  does that suit you yes or no since geniuses  like demons  recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs  thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person  it was like an intuition  he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude  while drinking with the carters smoking  and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening  he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger  watching him like a cat  and studying him like a mathematician  he had watched him both on his own account  for the pleasure of the thing  and through instinct  and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing  not a movement  not a gesture  on the part of the man in the yellow great coat had escaped him  even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette  thenardier had divined his purpose  he had caught the old man s deep glances returning constantly to the child  who was this man  why this interest  why this hideous costume  when he had so much money in his purse  questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them  and which irritated him  he had pondered it all night long  he could not be cosette s father  was he her grandfather  then why not make himself known at once  when one has a right  one asserts it  this man evidently had no right over cosette what was it  then  thenardier lost himself in conjectures  he caught glimpses of everything  but he saw nothing  be that as it may  on entering into conversation with the man  sure that there was some secret in the case  that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow  he felt himself strong  when he perceived from the stranger s clear and firm retort  that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple a way  he became conscious that he was weak  he had expected nothing of the sort  his conjectures were put to the rout  he rallied his ideas  he weighed everything in the space of a second  thenardier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance  he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward  and quickly at that  he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment  which they know that they alone recognize  he abruptly unmasked his batteries sir  said he  i am in need of fifteen hundred francs the stranger took from his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather  opened it  drew out three bank bills  which he laid on the table  then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the inn keeper go and fetch cosette while this was taking place  what had cosette been doing on waking up  cosette had run to get her shoe  in it she had found the gold piece  it was not a napoleon  it was one of those perfectly new twenty franc pieces of the restoration  on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath  cosette was dazzled  her destiny began to intoxicate her  she did not know what a gold piece was she had never seen one  she hid it quickly in her pocket  as though she had stolen it  still  she felt that it really was hers  she guessed whence her gift had come  but the joy which she experienced was full of fear  she was happy  above all she was stupefied  such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real  the doll frightened her  the gold piece frightened her  she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence  the stranger alone did not frighten her  on the contrary he reassured her  ever since the preceding evening  amid all her amazement  even in her sleep  she had been thinking in her little childish mind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad  and who was so rich and so kind  everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest  cosette  less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven  had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother s shadow and under a wing  for the last five years  that is to say  as far back as her memory ran  the poor child had shivered and trembled  she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity  now it seemed to her she was clothed formerly her soul had seemed cold  now it was warm  cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier  she was no longer alone  there was some one there she hastily set about her regular morning duties  that louis  which she had about her  in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen sou piece had fallen on the night before  distracted her thoughts  she dared not touch it  but she spent five minutes in gazing at it  with her tongue hanging out  if the truth must be told  as she swept the staircase  she paused remained standing there motionless  forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe  occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her  she had gone in search of cosette at her husband s orders what was quite unprecedented  she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her cosette  she said  almost gently  come immediately an instant later cosette entered the public room the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it  this bundle contained a little woollen gown  an apron  a fustian bodice  a kerchief  a petticoat  woollen stockings  shoes a complete outfit for a girl of seven years  all was black my child  said the man  take these  and go and dress yourself quickly daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of montfermeil who had begun to open their doors beheld a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning  and carrying a pink doll in her arms pass along the road to paris  they were going in the direction of livry it was our man and cosette no one knew the man  as cosette was no longer in rags  many did not recognize her  cosette was going away  with whom  she did not know whither  she knew not  all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her  no one had thought of bidding her farewell  nor had she thought of taking leave of any one  she was leaving that hated and hating house poor  gentle creature  whose heart had been repressed up to that hour cosette walked along gravely  with her large eyes wide open  and gazing at the sky  she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron  from time to time  she bent down and glanced at it  then she looked at the good man  she felt something as though she were beside the good god chapter x he who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way  as was her wont  she had expected great results  when the man and cosette had taken their departure  thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse  then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs is that all  said she it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the master s acts the blow told you are right  in sooth  said he  i am a fool  give me my hat he folded up the three bank bills  thrust them into his pocket  and ran out in all haste  but he made a mistake and turned to the right first some neighbors  of whom he made inquiries  put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of livry  he followed these hints  walking with great strides  and talking to himself the while that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow  and i am an animal first he gave twenty sous  then five francs  then fifty francs  then fifteen hundred francs  all with equal readiness  he would have given fifteen thousand francs  but i shall overtake him and then  that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child  all that was singular  many mysteries lay concealed under it  one does not let mysteries out of one s hand when one has once grasped them  the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of gold  one must know how to subject them to pressure  all these thoughts whirled through his brain  i am an animal  said he when one leaves montfermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to livry  it can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau  on arriving there  he calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child  he looked as far as his vision reached  and saw nothing  he made fresh inquiries  but he had wasted time  some passers by informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of gagny he hastened in that direction they were far in advance of him  but a child walks slowly  and he walked fast  and then  he was well acquainted with the country all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps i ought to have taken my gun  said he to himself thenardier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact  and who disappear without our finding them out  because destiny has only exhibited one side of them  it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged  in a calm and even situation  thenardier possessed all that is required to make we will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader  a good bourgeois  at the same time certain circumstances being given  certain shocks arriving to bring his under nature to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard  he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some taint of the monster  satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the hovel in which thenardier dwelt  and have fallen a dreaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece after a momentary hesitation bah  he thought  they will have time to make their escape and he pursued his road  walking rapidly straight ahead  and with almost an air of certainty  with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges in truth  when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue  and reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill  and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelles  he caught sight  over the top of the brushwood  of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures  it was that man s hat the brushwood was not high  thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there  the child could not be seen on account of her small size  but the head of her doll was visible thenardier was not mistaken  the man was sitting there  and letting cosette get somewhat rested  the inn keeper walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of pardon  excuse me  sir  he said  quite breathless  but here are your fifteen hundred francs so saying  he handed the stranger the three bank bills the man raised his eyes what is the meaning of this thenardier replied respectfully it means  sir  that i shall take back cosette cosette shuddered  and pressed close to the old man he replied  gazing to the very bottom of thenardier s eyes the while and enunciating every syllable distinctly you are go ing to take back co sette yes  sir  i am  i will tell you  i have considered the matter  in fact i have not the right to give her to you  i am an honest man  you see this child does not belong to me  she belongs to her mother  it was her mother who confided her to me  i can only resign her to her mother  you will say to me  but her mother is dead  good  in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing  signed by her mother  to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned  that is clear the man  without making any reply  fumbled in his pocket  and thenardier beheld the pocket book of bank bills make its appearance once more the tavern keeper shivered with joy good  thought he  let us hold firm  he is going to bribe me before opening the pocket book  the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted  there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley  the man opened his pocket book once more and drew from it  not the handful of bills which thenardier expected  but a simple little paper  which he unfolded and presented fully open to the inn keeper  saying you are right  read thenardier took the paper and read                               m  sur m  march   monsieur thenardier                you will deliver cosette to this person                you will be paid for all the little things                i have the honor to salute you with respect                                                   fantine you know that signature  resumed the man it certainly was fantine s signature  thenardier recognized it there was no reply to make  he experienced two violent vexations  the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for  and the vexation of being beaten  the man added you may keep this paper as your receipt thenardier retreated in tolerably good order this signature is fairly well imitated  he growled between his teeth however  let it go then he essayed a desperate effort it is well  sir  he said  since you are the person  but i must be paid for all those little things  a great deal is owing to me the man rose to his feet  filliping the dust from his thread bare sleeve monsieur thenardier  in january last  the mother reckoned that she owed you one hundred and twenty francs  in february  you sent her a bill of five hundred francs  you received three hundred francs at the end of february  and three hundred francs at the beginning of march  since then nine months have elapsed  at fifteen francs a month  the price agreed upon  which makes one hundred and thirty five francs  you had received one hundred francs too much  that makes thirty five still owing you  i have just given you fifteen hundred francs thenardier s sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap who is this devil of a man  he thought he did what the wolf does  he shook himself  audacity had succeeded with him once monsieur i don t know your name  he said resolutely  and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony  i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns the stranger said tranquilly come  cosette he took cosette by his left hand  and with his right he picked up his cudgel  which was lying on the ground thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot the man plunged into the forest with the child  leaving the inn keeper motionless and speechless while they were walking away  thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded  and his great fists then  bringing his eyes back to his own person  they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands  i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun  he said to himself  since i was going hunting however  the inn keeper did not give up i want to know where he is going  said he  and he set out to follow them at a distance  two things were left on his hands  an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine  and a consolation  the fifteen hundred francs the man led cosette off in the direction of livry and bondy  he walked slowly  with drooping head  in an attitude of reflection and sadness the winter had thinned out the forest  so that thenardier did not lose them from sight  although he kept at a good distance  the man turned round from time to time  and looked to see if he was being followed all at once he caught sight of thenardier  he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette  where they could both hide themselves  the deuce  said thenardier  and he redoubled his pace the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them  when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket  he wheeled round  it was in vain that thenardier sought to conceal himself in the branches  he could not prevent the man seeing him  the man cast upon him an uneasy glance  then elevated his head and continued his course  the inn keeper set out again in pursuit  thus they continued for two or three hundred paces  all at once the man turned round once more  he saw the inn keeper  this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless  to proceed further  thenardier retraced his steps chapter xi number  reappears  and cosette wins it in the lottery jean valjean was not dead when he fell into the sea  or rather  when he threw himself into it  he was not ironed  as we have seen  he swam under water until he reached a vessel at anchor  to which a boat was moored  he found means of hiding himself in this boat until night  at night he swam off again  and reached the shore a little way from cape brun  there  as he did not lack money  he procured clothing  a small country house in the neighborhood of balaguier was at that time the dressing room of escaped convicts a lucrative specialty  then jean valjean  like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary  he found his first refuge at pradeaux  near beausset  then he directed his course towards grand villard  near briancon  in the hautes alpes  it was a fumbling and uneasy flight a mole s track  whose branchings are untraceable  later on  some trace of his passage into ain  in the territory of civrieux was discovered  in the pyrenees  at accons  at the spot called grange de doumec  near the market of chavailles  and in the environs of perigueux at brunies  canton of la chapelle gonaguet  he reached paris we have just seen him at montfermeil his first care on arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl of from seven to eight years of age  then to procure a lodging  that done  he had betaken himself to montfermeil  it will be remembered that already  during his preceding escape  he had made a mysterious trip thither  or somewhere in that neighborhood  of which the law had gathered an inkling however  he was thought to be dead  and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him  at paris  one of the journals which chronicled the fact fell into his hands  he felt reassured and almost at peace  as though he had really been dead on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the claws of the thenardiers  he returned to paris  he re entered it at nightfall  with the child  by way of the barrier monceaux  there he entered a cabriolet  which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire  there he got out  paid the coachman  took cosette by the hand  and together they directed their steps through the darkness through the deserted streets which adjoin the ourcine and the glaciere  towards the boulevard de l hopital the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette  they had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns  behind hedges  they had changed carriages frequently  they had travelled short distances on foot  she made no complaint  but she was weary  and jean valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked  he took her on his back  cosette  without letting go of catherine  laid her head on jean valjean s shoulder  and there fell asleep book fourth the gorbeau hovel illustration  the gorbeau hovel  b gorbeau house chapter i master gorbeau forty years ago  a rambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the salpetriere  and who had mounted to the barriere d italie by way of the boulevard  reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared  it was no longer solitude  for there were passers by  it was not the country  for there were houses and streets  it was not the city  for the streets had ruts like highways  and the grass grew in them  it was not a village  the houses were too lofty  what was it then  it was an inhabited spot where there was no one  it was a desert place where there was some one  it was a boulevard of the great city  a street of paris  more wild at night than the forest  more gloomy by day than a cemetery it was the old quarter of the marche aux chevaux the rambler  if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this marche aux chevaux  if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du petit banquier  after leaving on his right a garden protected by high walls  then a field in which tan bark mills rose like gigantic beaver huts  then an enclosure encumbered with timber  with a heap of stumps sawdust  and shavings  on which stood a large dog  barking  then a long low  utterly dilapidated wall  with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses  which were covered with flowers in the spring  then in the most deserted spot  a frightful and decrepit building  on which ran the inscription in large letters  post no bills this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des vignes saint marcel  there  near a factory  and between two garden walls  there could be seen  at that epoch  a mean building which  at the first glance  seemed as small as a thatched hovel  and which was  in reality  as large as a cathedral  it presented its side and gable to the public road  hence its apparent diminutiveness  nearly the whole of the house was hidden  only the door and one window could be seen this hovel was only one story high the first detail that struck the observer was  that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel  while the window  if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion the door was nothing but a collection of worm eaten planks roughly bound together by cross beams which resembled roughly hewn logs  it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps  muddy  chalky plaster stained  dusty steps  of the same width as itself  which could be seen from the street  running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls  the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed  which served both as wicket and air hole when the door was closed  on the inside of the door the figures  had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink  and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number  so that one hesitated  where was one  above the door it said number  the inside replied  no  number  no one knows what dust colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening the window was large  sufficiently elevated  garnished with venetian blinds  and with a frame in large square panes  only these large panes were suffering from various wounds  which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage  and the blinds  dislocated and unpasted  threatened passers by rather than screened the occupants the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly  so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter  this door with an unclean  and this window with an honest though dilapidated air  thus beheld on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different miens beneath the same rags  the one having always been a mendicant  and the other having once been a gentleman the staircase led to a very vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house  this edifice had  for its intestinal tube  a long corridor  on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances  and rather more like stalls than cells  these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood all this was dark  disagreeable  wan  melancholy  sepulchral  traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door  by cold rays or by icy winds  an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders to the left of the entrance door  on the boulevard side  at about the height of a man from the ground  a small window which had been walled up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by a portion of this building has recently been demolished  from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was in former days as a whole  it was not over a hundred years old  a hundred years is youth in a church and age in a house  it seems as though man s lodging partook of his ephemeral character  and god s house of his eternity the postmen called the house number  but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorbeau house let us explain whence this appellation was derived collectors of petty details  who become herbalists of anecdotes  and prick slippery dates into their memories with a pin  know that there was in paris  during the last century  about  two attorneys at the chatelet named  one corbeau raven  the other renard fox  the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine  the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers  they made the most of it  a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the court house  in verses that limped a little           maitre corbeau  sur un dossier perche                tenait dans son bee une saisie executoire           maitre renard  par l odeur alleche                lui fit a peu pres cette histoire                     he  bonjour   etc the two honest practitioners  embarrassed by the jests  and finding the bearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them  resolved to get rid of their names  and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king their petition was presented to louis xv  on the same day when the papal nuncio  on the one hand  and the cardinal de la roche aymon on the other  both devoutly kneeling  were each engaged in putting on  in his majesty s presence  a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry  who had just got out of bed  the king  who was laughing  continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers  and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names  or nearly so  by the kings command  maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself gorbeau  maitre renard was less lucky  all he obtained was leave to place a p in front of his r  and to call himself prenard  so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first now  according to local tradition  this maitre gorbeau had been the proprietor of the building numbered  on the boulevard de l hopital he was even the author of the monumental window hence the edifice bore the name of the gorbeau house opposite this house  among the trees of the boulevard  rose a great elm which was three quarters dead  almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriere des gobelins  a street then without houses  unpaved planted with unhealthy trees  which was green or muddy according to the season  and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris  an odor of copperas issued in puffs from the roofs of the neighboring factory the barrier was close at hand  in  the city wall was still in existence this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind  it was the road to bicetre  it was through it that  under the empire and the restoration  prisoners condemned to death re entered paris on the day of their execution  it was there  that  about  was committed that mysterious assassination  called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier  whose authors justice was never able to discover  a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated  a frightful enigma which has never been unriddled  take a few steps  and you come upon that fatal rue croulebarbe  where ulbach stabbed the goat girl of ivry to the sound of thunder  as in the melodramas  a few paces more  and you arrive at the abominable pollarded elms of the barriere saint jacques  that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold  that miserable and shameful place de grove of a shop keeping and bourgeois society  which recoiled before the death penalty  neither daring to abolish it with grandeur  nor to uphold it with authority leaving aside this place saint jacques  which was  as it were predestined  and which has always been horrible  probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard  seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even to day is so unattractive  where stood the building number bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty five years later the place was unpleasant  in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there  one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose dome could be seen  and bicetre  whose outskirts one was fairly touching  that is to say  between the madness of women and the madness of men  as far as the eye could see  one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs  the city wall  and the fronts of a few factories  resembling barracks or monasteries  everywhere about stood hovels  rubbish  ancient walls blackened like cerecloths  new white walls like winding sheets  everywhere parallel rows of trees  buildings erected on a line  flat constructions  long  cold rows  and the melancholy sadness of right angles  not an unevenness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture  not a fold  the ensemble was glacial regular  hideous  nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry  it is because symmetry is ennui  and ennui is at the very foundation of grief despair yawns  something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined  and that is a hell where one is bored  if such a hell existed  that bit of the boulevard de l hopital might have formed the entrance to it nevertheless  at nightfall  at the moment when the daylight is vanishing  especially in winter  at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves  when the darkness is deep and starless  or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows  this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful  the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades  like morsels of the infinite  the passer by cannot refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet  the solitude of this spot  where so many crimes have been committed  had something terrible about it  one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness  all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious  and the long  hollow square  of which one caught a glimpse between each tree  seemed graves  by day it was ugly  in the evening melancholy  by night it was sinister in summer  at twilight  one saw  here and there  a few old women seated at the foot of the elm  on benches mouldy with rain  these good old women were fond of begging however  this quarter  which had a superannuated rather than an antique air  was tending even then to transformation  even at that time any one who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste  each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing  for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it  as it does to day  wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital  a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city  it seems as though  around these great centres of the movements of a people  the earth  full of germs  trembled and yawned  to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth  at the rattle of these powerful machines  at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire  the old houses crumble and new ones rise since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient  narrow streets which adjoin the moats saint victor and the jardin des plantes tremble  as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach fiacres and omnibuses which  in a given time  crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow  it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarges streets  the symptoms of a new life are evident  in this old provincial quarter  in the wildest nooks the pavement shows itself  the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer  even where there are as yet no pedestrians  one morning a memorable morning in july  black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there  on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de l ourcine  and that paris had entered the suburb of saint marceau chapter ii a nest for owl and a warbler it was in front of this gorbeau house that jean valjean halted  like wild birds  he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket  drew out a sort of a pass key opened the door  entered  closed it again carefully  and ascended the staircase  still carrying cosette at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key  with which he opened another door  the chamber which he entered  and which he closed again instantly  was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor  a table  and several chairs  a stove in which a fire was burning  and whose embers were visible  stood in one corner  a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room  at the extreme end there was a dressing room with a folding bed  jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her he struck a match and lighted a candle  all this was prepared beforehand on the table  and  as he had done on the previous evening  he began to scrutinize cosette s face with a gaze full of ecstasy  in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration  the little girl  with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness  had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was  and continued to sleep without knowing where she was jean valjean bent down and kissed that child s hand nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother  who had also just fallen asleep the same sad  piercing  religious sentiment filled his heart he knelt beside cosette s bed lt was broad daylight  and the child still slept  a wan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade  all at once a heavily laden carrier s cart  which was passing along the boulevard  shook the frail bed  like a clap of thunder  and made it quiver from top to bottom yes  madame  cried cosette  waking with a start  here i am  here i am and she sprang out of bed  her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep  extending her arms towards the corner of the wall ah  mon dieu  my broom  said she she opened her eyes wide now  and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean ah  so it is true  said the child  good morning  monsieur children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly  being themselves by nature joy and happiness cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed  and took possession of her  and  as she played  she put a hundred questions to jean valjean  where was she  was paris very large  was madame thenardier very far away  was she to go back  etc  etc  all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here it was a frightful hole  but she felt free must i sweep  she resumed at last play  said jean valjean the day passed thus  cosette  without troubling herself to understand anything  was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man chapter iii two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune on the following morning  at daybreak  jean valjean was still by cosette s bedside  he watched there motionless  waiting for her to wake some new thing had come into his soul jean valjean had never loved anything  for twenty five years he had been alone in the world  he had never been father  lover  husband  friend  in the prison he had been vicious  gloomy  chaste  ignorant  and shy the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity  his sister and his sister s children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had finally almost completely vanished  he had made every effort to find them  and not having been able to find them  he had forgotten them human nature is made thus  the other tender emotions of his youth  if he had ever had any  had fallen into an abyss when he saw cosette  when he had taken possession of her  carried her off  and delivered her  he felt his heart moved within him all the passion and affection within him awoke  and rushed towards that child  he approached the bed  where she lay sleeping  and trembled with joy  he suffered all the pangs of a mother  and he knew not what it meant  for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing poor old man  with a perfectly new heart only  as he was five and fifty  and cosette eight years of age  all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light it was the second white apparition which he had encountered  the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon  cosette caused the dawn of love to rise the early days passed in this dazzled state cosette  on her side  had also  unknown to herself  become another being  poor little thing  she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her  like all children  who resemble young shoots of the vine  which cling to everything  she had tried to love she had not succeeded  all had repulsed her the thenardiers  their children  other children  she had loved the dog  and he had died  after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her  it is a sad thing to say  and we have already intimated it  that  at eight years of age  her heart was cold  it was not her fault  it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked  alas  it was the possibility  thus  from the very first day  all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man  she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor  she thought jean valjean handsome  just as she thought the hovel pretty these are the effects of the dawn  of childhood  of joy  the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here  nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret  we all have in our past a delightful garret nature  a difference of fifty years  had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette  destiny filled in this gulf  destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences  differing in age  alike in sorrow  one  in fact  completed the other  cosette s instinct sought a father  as jean valjean s instinct sought a child  to meet was to find each other  at the mysterious moment when their hands touched  they were welded together when these two souls perceived each other  they recognized each other as necessary to each other  and embraced each other closely taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense  we may say that  separated from every one by the walls of the tomb  jean valjean was the widower  and cosette was the orphan  this situation caused jean valjean to become cosette s father after a celestial fashion and in truth  the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping hers in the dark was not an illusion  but a reality  the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god moreover  jean valjean had chosen his refuge well  there he seemed perfectly secure the chamber with a dressing room  which he occupied with cosette  was the one whose window opened on the boulevard  this being the only window in the house  no neighbors  glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side the ground floor of number  a sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a wagon house for market gardeners  and no communication existed between it and the first story  it was separated by the flooring  which had neither traps nor stairs  and which formed the diaphragm of the building  as it were  the first story contained  as we have said  numerous chambers and several attics  only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjean s housekeeping  all the rest was uninhabited it was this old woman  ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of portress  who had let him the lodging on christmas eve  he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds  who was coming there to live with his little daughter  he had paid her six months in advance  and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room  as we have seen  it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove  and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival week followed week  these two beings led a happy life in that hovel cosette laughed  chattered  and sang from daybreak  children have their morning song as well as birds it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand  all cracked with chilblains  and kissed it  the poor child  who was used to being beaten  did not know the meaning of this  and ran away in confusion at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown  cosette was no longer in rags  she was in mourning  she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read  sometimes  as he made the child spell  he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison  this idea had ended in teaching a child to read  then the ex convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels he felt in it a premeditation from on high  the will of some one who was not man  and he became absorbed in revery  good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones to teach cosette to read  and to let her play  this constituted nearly the whole of jean valjean s existence  and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray she called him father  and knew no other name for him he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll  and in listening to her prattle  life  henceforth  appeared to him to be full of interest  men seemed to him good and just  he no longer reproached any one in thought  he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man  now that this child loved him  he saw a whole future stretching out before him  illuminated by cosette as by a charming light  the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts  at times  he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly this is only a personal opinion  but  to utter our whole thought  at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette  it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well doing  he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects  which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine  and public authority as personified in javert  he had returned to prison  this time for having done right  he had quaffed fresh bitterness  disgust and lassitude were overpowering him  even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse  though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant  but  after all  that sacred memory was growing dim who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more  he loved and grew strong again alas  he walked with no less indecision than cosette  he protected her and she strengthened him  thanks to him  she could walk through life thanks to her  he could continue in virtue  he was that child s stay and she was his prop  oh  unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny chapter iv the remarks of the principal tenant jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day  every evening at twilight  he walked for an hour or two  sometimes alone  often with cosette  seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard  and entering churches at nightfall  he liked to go to saint medard  which is the nearest church  when he did not take cosette with him  she remained with the old woman  but the child s delight was to go out with the good man  she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete a tetes with catherine  he held her hand as they walked  and said sweet things to her it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market they lived soberly  always having a little fire  but like people in very moderate circumstances  jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day  he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette s dressing room replaced by a solid door he still wore his yellow coat  his black breeches  and his old hat in the street  he was taken for a poor man  it sometimes happened that kind hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him  jean valjean accepted the sou with a deep bow  it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms  then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him  stealthily approached the unfortunate man  put a piece of money into his hand  often a silver coin  and walked rapidly away  this had its disadvantages  he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms the old principal lodger  a cross looking creature  who was thoroughly permeated  so far as her neighbors were concerned  with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons  scrutinized jean valjean a great deal  without his suspecting the fact  she was a little deaf which rendered her talkative  there remained to her from her past  two teeth one above  the other below which she was continually knocking against each other  she had questioned cosette  who had not been able to tell her anything  since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from montfermeil  one morning  this spy saw jean valjean  with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar  entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel  she followed him with the step of an old cat  and was able to observe him without being seen  through a crack in the door  which was directly opposite him  jean valjean had his back turned towards this door  by way of greater security  no doubt  the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case  scissors and thread  then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat  and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper  which he unfolded  the old woman recognized  with terror  the fact that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs  it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence  she fled in alarm a moment later  jean valjean accosted her  and asked her to go and get this thousand franc bill changed for him  adding that it was his quarterly income  which he had received the day before  where  thought the old woman  he did not go out until six o clock in the evening  and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour  the old woman went to get the bill changed  and mentioned her surmises  that thousand franc note  commented on and multiplied  produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes saint marcel a few days later  it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood  in his shirt sleeves  in the corridor  the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order  she was alone  cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed  the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on a nail  and examined it  the lining had been sewed up again  the good woman felt of it carefully  and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thicknesses of paper  more thousand franc bank bills  no doubt she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets not only the needles  thread  and scissors which she had seen  but a big pocket book  a very large knife  and a suspicious circumstance several wigs of various colors  each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter chapter v a five franc piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult near saint medard s church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned  and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity  he never passed this man without giving him a few sous  sometimes he spoke to him  those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police  he was an ex beadle of seventy five  who was constantly mumbling his prayers one evening  as jean valjean was passing by  when he had not cosette with him  he saw the beggar in his usual place  beneath the lantern which had just been lighted  the man seemed engaged in prayer  according to his custom  and was much bent over  jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand  the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly  stared intently at jean valjean  then dropped his head quickly  this movement was like a flash of lightning  jean valjean was seized with a shudder  it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern  not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle  but of a well known and startling face  he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one s self  all of a sudden  face to face  in the dark  with a tiger  he recoiled  terrified  petrified  daring neither to breathe  to speak to remain  nor to flee  staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag  and no longer appeared to know that he was there  at this strange moment  an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a word  the beggar had the same figure  the same rags  the same appearance as he had every day  bah  said jean valjean  i am mad  i am dreaming impossible  and he returned profoundly troubled he hardly dared to confess  even to himself  that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert that night  on thinking the matter over  he regretted not having questioned the man  in order to force him to raise his head a second time on the following day  at nightfall  he went back  the beggar was at his post  good day  my good man  said jean valjean  resolutely  handing him a sou  the beggar raised his head  and replied in a whining voice thanks  my good sir  it was unmistakably the ex beadle jean valjean felt completely reassured  he began to laugh  how the deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there  he thought  am i going to lose my eyesight now  and he thought no more about it a few days afterwards it might have been at eight o clock in the evening he was in his room  and engaged in making cosette spell aloud when he heard the house door open and then shut again  this struck him as singular  the old woman  who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself  always went to bed at nightfall  so that she might not burn out her candles  jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet he heard some one ascending the stairs  it might possibly be the old woman  who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary s jean valjean listened the step was heavy  and sounded like that of a man  but the old woman wore stout shoes  and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman  nevertheless  jean valjean blew out his candle he had sent cosette to bed  saying to her in a low voice  get into bed very softly  and as he kissed her brow  the steps paused jean valjean remained silent  motionless  with his back towards the door  seated on the chair from which he had not stirred  and holding his breath in the dark after the expiration of a rather long interval  he turned round  as he heard nothing more  and  as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber  he saw a light through the keyhole  this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall  there was evidently some one there  who was holding a candle in his hand and listening several minutes elapsed thus  and the light retreated  but he heard no sound of footsteps  which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes jean valjean threw himself  all dressed as he was  on his bed  and could not close his eyes all night at daybreak  just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue  he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor  then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening  the step was approaching he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole  which was tolerably large  hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door  as he passed  it was a man  in fact  who passed  this time without pausing  in front of jean valjean s chamber  the corridor was too dark to allow of the person s face being distinguished  but when the man reached the staircase  a ray of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette  and jean valjean had a complete view of his back  the man was of lofty stature clad in a long frock coat  with a cudgel under his arm  the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard  but he would have been obliged to open the window  he dared not it was evident that this man had entered with a key  and like himself who had given him that key  what was the meaning of this when the old woman came to do the work  at seven o clock in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her  but he did not question her  the good woman appeared as usual as she swept up she remarked to him possibly monsieur may have heard some one come in last night at that age  and on that boulevard  eight o clock in the evening was the dead of the night that is true  by the way  he replied  in the most natural tone possible  who was it it was a new lodger who has come into the house  said the old woman and what is his name i don t know exactly  dumont  or daumont  or some name of that sort and who is this monsieur dumont the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes  and answered a gentleman of property  like yourself perhaps she had no ulterior meaning  jean valjean thought he perceived one when the old woman had taken her departure  he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard  into a roll  and put it in his pocket  in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver  a hundred sou piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor when darkness came on  he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard  he saw no one  the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted  it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees he went up stairs again come  he said to cosette he took her by the hand  and they both went out book fifth for a black hunt  a mute pack chapter i the zigzags of strategy an observation here becomes necessary  in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse  and of others which will be met with further on the author of this book  who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself  has been absent from paris for many years  paris has been transformed since he quitted it  a new city has arisen  which is  after a fashion  unknown to him  there is no need for him to say that he loves paris  paris is his mind s natal city  in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions  the paris of his youth  that paris which he bore away religiously in his memory  is now a paris of days gone by  he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed  it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house  neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality  readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble  for his own part  he is unacquainted with the new paris  and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him  it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country  and that all has not vanished so long as you go and come in your native land  you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you  that those windows those roofs  and those doors are nothing to you  that those walls are strangers to you  that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard  that those houses  which you do not enter  are useless to you  that the pavements which you tread are merely stones  later on when you are no longer there  you perceive that the streets are dear to you  that you miss those roofs  those doors  and that those walls are necessary to you  those trees are well beloved by you  that you entered those houses which you never entered  every day  and that you have left a part of your heart  of your blood  of your soul  in those pavements all those places which you no longer behold  which you may never behold again  perchance  and whose memory you have cherished  take on a melancholy charm  recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition  make the holy land visible to you  and are  so to speak the very form of france  and you love them  and you call them up as they are  as they were  and you persist in this  and you will submit to no change  for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother may we  then  be permitted to speak of the past in the present  that said  we beg the reader to take note of it  and we continue jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets  taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times  to make sure that he was not being followed illustration  the black hunt  b black hunt this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted stag  on soil where an imprint of the track may be left  this manoeuvre possesses  among other advantages  that of deceiving the huntsmen and the dogs  by throwing them on the wrong scent  in venery this is called false re imbushment the moon was full that night  jean valjean was not sorry for this  the moon  still very close to the horizon  cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets  jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side  and yet keep watch on the light side  he did not  perhaps  take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him  still  in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue poliveau  he thought he felt certain that no one was following him cosette walked on without asking any questions  the sufferings of the first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature  moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur she had grown used  without being herself aware of it  to the peculiarities of this good man and to the freaks of destiny  and then she was with him  and she felt safe jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette  he trusted in god  as she trusted in him  it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of some one greater than himself  he thought he felt a being leading him  though invisible  however  he had no settled idea  no plan  no project  he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert  and then it might have been javert  without javert knowing that he was jean valjean  was not he disguised  was not he believed to be dead  still  queer things had been going on for several days  he wanted no more of them  he was determined not to return to the gorbeau house like the wild animal chased from its lair  he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in the mouffetard quarter  which was already asleep  as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed  he combined in various manners  with cunning strategy  the rue censier and the rue copeau  the rue du battoir saint victor and the rue du puits l ermite there are lodging houses in this locality  but he did not even enter one  finding nothing which suited him  he had no doubt that if any one had chanced to be upon his track  they would have lost it as eleven o clock struck from saint etienne du mont  he was traversing the rue de pontoise  in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no   a few moments later  the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round  at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the commissary s lantern  which betrayed them  three men who were following him closely  pass  one after the other  under that lantern  on the dark side of the street  one of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary s house  the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious come  child  he said to cosette  and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise he took a circuit  turned into the passage des patriarches  which was closed on account of the hour  strode along the rue de l epee de bois and the rue de l arbalete  and plunged into the rue des postes at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets  where the college rollin stands to day  and where the rue neuve sainte genevieve turns off it is understood  of course  that the rue neuve sainte genevieve is an old street  and that a posting chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years  in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters  and its real name is rue des pots the moon cast a livid light into this open space  jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway  calculating that if the men were still following him  he could not fail to get a good look at them  as they traversed this illuminated space in point of fact  three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance  there were four of them now  all were tall  dressed in long brown coats  with round hats  and huge cudgels in their hands  their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness  one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group  like men in consultation  they had an air of indecision  the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken  another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy  at the moment when the first man wheeled round  the moon fell full in his face  jean valjean recognized javert perfectly chapter ii it is lucky that the pont d austerlitz bears carriages uncertainty was at an end for jean valjean  fortunately it still lasted for the men  he took advantage of their hesitation  it was time lost for them  but gained for him  he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself  and went down the rue des postes  towards the region of the jardin des plantes  cosette was beginning to be tired  he took her in his arms and carried her  there were no passers by  and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon he redoubled his pace in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries  on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription                de goblet fils c est ici la fabrique                venez choisir des cruches et des broos                des pots a fleurs  des tuyaux  de la brique                a tout venant le coeur vend des carreaux he left behind him the rue de la clef  then the fountain saint victor skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets  and reached the quay  there he turned round  the quay was deserted  the streets were deserted  there was no one behind him  he drew a long breath he gained the pont d austerlitz tolls were still collected there at that epoch he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou it is two sous  said the old soldier in charge of the bridge  you are carrying a child who can walk  pay for two he paid  vexed that his passage should have aroused remark  every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself  and on its way  like him  to the right bank  this was of use to him  he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart towards the middle of the bridge  cosette  whose feet were benumbed wanted to walk  he set her on the ground and took her hand again the bridge once crossed  he perceived some timber yards on his right  he directed his course thither  in order to reach them  it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space he did not hesitate  those who were on his track had evidently lost the scent  and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger  hunted yes  followed  no a little street  the rue du chemin vert saint antoine  opened out between two timber yards enclosed in walls  this street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him  before entering it he cast a glance behind him from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont d austerlitz four shadows were just entering on the bridge these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank these four shadows were the four men jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured one hope remained to him  it was  that the men had not  perhaps  stepped on the bridge  and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space  holding cosette by the hand in that case  by plunging into the little street before him  he might escape  if he could reach the timber yards  the marshes  the market gardens  the uninhabited ground which was not built upon it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street  he entered it chapter iii to wit  the plan of paris in three hundred paces further on  he arrived at a point where the street forked  it separated into two streets  which ran in a slanting line  one to the right  and the other to the left jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a y which should he choose  he did not hesitate  but took the one on the right why because that to the left ran towards a suburb  that is to say  towards inhabited regions  and the right branch towards the open country  that is to say  towards deserted regions however  they no longer walked very fast  cosette s pace retarded jean valjean s he took her up and carried her again  cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word he turned round from time to time and looked behind him  he took care to keep always on the dark side of the street  the street was straight in his rear  the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing  the silence was profound  and he continued his march somewhat reassured  all at once  on turning round  he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through  far off in the obscurity  something which was moving he rushed forward precipitately rather than walked  hoping to find some side street  to make his escape through it  and thus to break his scent once more he arrived at a wall this wall  however  did not absolutely prevent further progress  it was a wall which bordered a transverse street  in which the one he had taken ended here again  he was obliged to come to a decision  should he go to the right or to the left he glanced to the right  the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns  then ended at a blind alley the extremity of the cul de sac was distinctly visible a lofty white wall he glanced to the left  on that side the lane was open  and about two hundred paces further on  ran into a street of which it was the affluent  on that side lay safety at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left  in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the lane  he perceived a sort of motionless  black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps it was some one  a man  who had evidently just been posted there  and who was barring the passage and waiting jean valjean recoiled the point of paris where jean valjean found himself  situated between the faubourg saint antoine and la rapee  is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to some  and in a transfiguration according to others  the market gardens  the timber yards  and the old buildings have been effaced  to day  there are brand new  wide streets  arenas circuses  hippodromes  railway stations  and a prison  mazas  there progress  as the reader sees  with its antidote half a century ago  in that ordinary  popular tongue  which is all compounded of traditions  which persists in calling the institut les quatre nations  and the opera comique feydeau  the precise spot whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit picpus  the porte saint jacques  the porte paris  the barriere des sergents  the porcherons  la galiote  les celestins  les capucins  le mail  la bourbe l arbre de cracovie  la petite pologne these are the names of old paris which survive amid the new  the memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past le petit picpus  which  moreover  hardly ever had any existence  and never was more than the outline of a quarter  had nearly the monkish aspect of a spanish town  the roads were not much paved  the streets were not much built up  with the exception of the two or three streets of which we shall presently speak  all was wall and solitude there  not a shop  not a vehicle  hardly a candle lighted here and there in the windows  all lights extinguished after ten o clock  gardens  convents timber yards  marshes  occasional lowly dwellings and great walls as high as the houses such was this quarter in the last century  the revolution snubbed it soundly  the republican government demolished and cut through it rubbish shoots were established there  thirty years ago  this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings  to day it has been utterly blotted out  the petit picpus  of which no existing plan has preserved a trace  is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of  published at paris by denis thierry  rue saint jacques  opposite the rue du platre  and at lyons  by jean girin rue merciere  at the sign of prudence  petit picpus had  as we have just mentioned  a y of streets  formed by the rue du chemin vert saint antoine  which spread out in two branches  taking on the left the name of little picpus street  and on the right the name of the rue polonceau  the two limbs of the y were connected at the apex as by a bar  this bar was called rue droit mur  the rue polonceau ended there  rue petit picpus passed on  and ascended towards the lenoir market  a person coming from the seine reached the extremity of the rue polonceau  and had on his right the rue droit mur  turning abruptly at a right angle  in front of him the wall of that street  and on his right a truncated prolongation of the rue droit mur  which had no issue and was called the cul de sac genrot it was here that jean valjean stood as we have just said  on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the rue droit mur and the rue petit picpus  he recoiled  there could be no doubt of it  that phantom was lying in wait for him what was he to do the time for retreating was passed  that which he had perceived in movement an instant before  in the distant darkness  was javert and his squad without a doubt  javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood  javert  to all appearances  was acquainted with this little labyrinth  and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit  these surmises  which so closely resembled proofs  whirled suddenly  like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gust of wind  through jean valjean s mournful brain  he examined the cul de sac genrot  there he was cut off  he examined the rue petit picpus  there stood a sentinel he saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement  illuminated by the moon  to advance was to fall into this man s hands  to retreat was to fling himself into javert s arms  jean valjean felt himself caught  as in a net  which was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair chapter iv the gropings of flight in order to understand what follows  it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit mur lane  and  in particular  of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polonceau into this lane  droit mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right  as far as the rue petit picpus  by houses of mean aspect  on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines  composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue petit picpus side  so that this building  which was very lofty on the rue petit picpus side  was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue polonceau  there  at the angle of which we have spoken  it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall  this wall did not abut directly on the street  it formed a deeply retreating niche  concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been  one in the rue polonceau  the other in the rue droit mur beginning with these angles of the niche  the wall extended along the rue polonceau as far as a house which bore the number  and along the rue droit mur  where the fragment was much shorter  as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected  thus forming another retreating angle in the street  this gable was sombre of aspect  only one window was visible  or  to speak more correctly  two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact  and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door  it was a vast  formless assemblage of perpendicular planks  the upper ones being broader than the lower  bound together by long transverse strips of iron  at one side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions  and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously a linden tree showed its crest above the niche  and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the rue polonceau in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself  this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him he ran his eyes rapidly over it  he said to himself  that if he could contrive to get inside it  he might save himself  first he conceived an idea  then a hope in the central portion of the front of this building  on the rue droit mur side  there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead  the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front  these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vine stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm houses this odd espalier  with its branches of lead and iron  was the first thing that struck jean valjean  he seated cosette with her back against a stone post  with an injunction to be silent  and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement  perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house  but the pipe was dilapidated and past service  and hardly hung to its fastenings  moreover  all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars  even the attic windows in the roof  and then  the moon fell full upon that facade  and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing  and finally  what was to be done with cosette  how was she to be drawn up to the top of a three story house he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain pipe  and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue polonceau when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette  he noticed that no one could see him there  as we have just explained  he was concealed from all eyes  no matter from which direction they were approaching  besides this  he was in the shadow  finally  there were two doors  perhaps they might be forced  the wall above which he saw the linden tree and the ivy evidently abutted on a garden where he could  at least  hide himself  although there were as yet no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night time was passing  he must act quickly he felt over the carriage door  and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in he approached the other door with more hope  it was frightfully decrepit  its very immensity rendered it less solid  the planks were rotten  the iron bands there were only three of them were rusted  it seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm eaten barrier on examining it he found that the door was not a door  it had neither hinges  cross bars  lock  nor fissure in the middle  the iron bands traversed it from side to side without any break  through the crevices in the planks he caught a view of unhewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together  which passers by might still have seen there ten years ago  he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed  it was easy to tear off a plank  but then  one found one s self face to face with a wall chapter v which would be impossible with gas lanterns at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance  jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street seven or eight soldiers  drawn up in a platoon  had just debouched into the rue polonceau  he saw the gleam of their bayonets  they were advancing towards him  these soldiers  at whose head he distinguished javert s tall figure  advanced slowly and cautiously  they halted frequently  it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys this was some patrol that javert had encountered there could be no mistake as to this surmise and whose aid he had demanded javert s two acolytes were marching in their ranks at the rate at which they were marching  and in consideration of the halts which they were making  it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood  it was a frightful moment  a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time  and the galleys now meant not only the galleys  but cosette lost to him forever  that is to say  a life resembling the interior of a tomb there was but one thing which was possible jean valjean had this peculiarity  that he carried  as one might say two beggar s pouches  in one he kept his saintly thoughts  in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict  he rummaged in the one or the other  according to circumstances among his other resources  thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon  he was  as it will be remembered  a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing irons  by sheer muscular force  by leaning on the nape of his neck  his shoulders  his hips  and his knees  by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone  in the right angle of a wall  as high as the sixth story  if need be  an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which battemolle  condemned to death  made his escape twenty years ago jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden  it was about eighteen feet in height  the angle which it formed with the gable of the large building was filled  at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape  probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passers by  this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris this mass was about five feet in height  the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping cosette was the difficulty  for she did not know how to climb a wall should he abandon her  jean valjean did not once think of that  it was impossible to carry her  a man s whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular ascents  the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards a rope would have been required  jean valjean had none  where was he to get a rope at midnight  in the rue polonceau  certainly  if jean valjean had had a kingdom  he would have given it for a rope at that moment all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle  sometimes illuminate us jean valjean s despairing glance fell on the street lantern post of the blind alley genrot at that epoch there were no gas jets in the streets of paris  at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted  they were ascended and descended by means of a rope  which traversed the street from side to side  and was adjusted in a groove of the post  the pulley over which this rope ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box  the key to which was kept by the lamp lighter  and the rope itself was protected by a metal case jean valjean  with the energy of a supreme struggle  crossed the street at one bound  entered the blind alley  broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife  and an instant later he was beside cosette once more  he had a rope  these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night  the lantern in the cul de sac genrot was thus naturally extinct like the rest  and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place nevertheless  the hour  the place  the darkness  jean valjean s absorption  his singular gestures  his goings and comings  all had begun to render cosette uneasy  any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before  she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat  they could hear the sound of the patrol s approach ever more and more distinctly father  said she  in a very low voice  i am afraid  who is coming yonder hush  replied the unhappy man  it is madame thenardier cosette shuddered  he added say nothing  don t interfere with me  if you cry out  if you weep  the thenardier is lying in wait for you  she is coming to take you back then  without haste  but without making a useless movement  with firm and curt precision  the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment  he undid his cravat  passed it round cosette s body under the armpits  taking care that it should not hurt the child  fastened this cravat to one end of the rope  by means of that knot which seafaring men call a swallow knot  took the other end of the rope in his teeth  pulled off his shoes and stockings  which he threw over the wall  stepped upon the mass of masonry  and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows  half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement  without uttering a word  jean valjean s injunction  and the name of madame thenardier  had chilled her blood all at once she heard jean valjean s voice crying to her  though in a very low tone put your back against the wall she obeyed don t say a word  and don t be alarmed  went on jean valjean and she felt herself lifted from the ground before she had time to recover herself  she was on the top of the wall jean valjean grasped her  put her on his back  took her two tiny hands in his large left hand  lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant  as he had guessed  there stood a building whose roof started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground  with a gentle slope which grazed the linden tree  a lucky circumstance  for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side  jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him he had just reached the slope of the roof  and had not yet left the crest of the wall  when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol  the thundering voice of javert was audible search the blind alley  the rue droit mur is guarded  so is the rue petit picpus  i ll answer for it that he is in the blind alley the soldiers rushed into the genrot alley jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof  still holding fast to cosette  reached the linden tree  and leaped to the ground  whether from terror or courage  cosette had not breathed a sound  though her hands were a little abraded chapter vi the beginning of an enigma jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect  one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night  this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end  tolerably tall forest trees in the corners  and an unshaded space in the centre  where could be seen a very large  solitary tree  then several fruit trees  gnarled and bristling like bushes  beds of vegetables  a melon patch  whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight  and an old well  here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss  the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs  the grass had half taken possession of them  and a green mould covered the rest jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent  a pile of fagots  and  behind the fagots  directly against the wall  a stone statue  whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom the building was a sort of ruin  where dismantled chambers were distinguishable  one of which  much encumbered  seemed to serve as a shed the large building of the rue droit mur  which had a wing on the rue petit picpus  turned two facades  at right angles  towards this garden these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior  all the windows were grated  not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them  the upper story had scuttles like prisons  one of those facades cast its shadow on the other  which fell over the garden like an immense black pall no other house was visible  the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness  nevertheless  walls could be confusedly made out  which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond  and the low roofs of the rue polonceau nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined  there was no one in it  which was quite natural in view of the hour  but it did not seem as though this spot were made for any one to walk in  even in broad daylight jean valjean s first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again  then to step under the shed with cosette  a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden  the child  whose thoughts were still on the thenardier  shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible cosette trembled and pressed close to him  they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets  the blows of their gun stocks against the stones  javert s appeals to the police spies whom he had posted  and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy roar were becoming more distant  jean valjean held his breath he had laid his hand lightly on cosette s mouth however  the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm  that this frightful uproar  close and furious as it was  did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving  it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak all at once  in the midst of this profound calm  a fresh sound arose  a sound as celestial  divine  ineffable  ravishing  as the other had been horrible  it was a hymn which issued from the gloom  a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night women s voices  but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which are not of the earth  and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears  and which the dying man hears already  this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden  at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated  one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees they knew not what it was  they knew not where they were  but both of them  the man and the child  the penitent and the innocent  felt that they must kneel these voices had this strange characteristic  that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted  it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house while these voices were singing  jean valjean thought of nothing  he no longer beheld the night  he beheld a blue sky  it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us  unfolding the song died away  it may have lasted a long time  jean valjean could not have told  hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment all fell silent again  there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden  that which had menaced  that which had reassured him all had vanished  the breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall  and they gave out a faint  sweet  melancholy sound chapter vii continuation of the enigma the night wind had risen  which indicated that it must be between one and two o clock in the morning  poor cosette said nothing  as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him  jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep  he bent down and looked at her cosette s eyes were wide open  and her thoughtful air pained jean valjean she was still trembling are you sleepy  said jean valjean i am very cold  she replied a moment later she resumed is she still there who  said jean valjean madame thenardier jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keep silent ah  said he  she is gone  you need fear nothing further the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast the ground was damp  the shed open on all sides  the breeze grew more keen every instant  the goodman took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette are you less cold now  said he oh  yes  father well  wait for me a moment  i will soon be back he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building  seeking a better shelter  he came across doors  but they were closed  there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice  he observed that he was coming to some arched windows  where he perceived a light he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows  they all opened on a tolerably vast hall  paved with large flagstones  cut up by arcades and pillars  where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible  the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner  the apartment was deserted  and nothing was stirring in it nevertheless  by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet  and which resembled a human form  this form was lying face downward  flat on the pavement  with the arms extended in the form of a cross  in the immobility of death  one would have said  judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor  that this sinister form had a rope round its neck the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are sparely illuminated  which adds to horror jean valjean often said afterwards  that  although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life  he had never beheld anything more blood curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place  and beheld thus at night  it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead  and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass  and to watch whether the thing would move  in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time  the outstretched form made no movement  all at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror  and he fled  he began to run towards the shed  not daring to look behind him it seemed to him  that if he turned his head  he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms he reached the ruin all out of breath  his knees were giving way beneath him  the perspiration was pouring from him where was he  who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris  what was this strange house  an edifice full of nocturnal mystery  calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels  and when they came  offering them abruptly that terrible vision  promising to open the radiant portals of heaven  and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb  and it actually was an edifice  a house  which bore a number on the street  it was not a dream he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact cold  anxiety  uneasiness  the emotions of the night  had given him a genuine fever  and all these ideas were clashing together in his brain he stepped up to cosette  she was asleep chapter viii the enigma becomes doubly mysterious the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep he sat down beside her and began to think  little by little  as he gazed at her  he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind he clearly perceived this truth  the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there  so long as he had her near him  he should need nothing except for her  he should fear nothing except for her  he was not even conscious that he was very cold  since he had taken off his coat to cover her nevertheless  athwart this revery into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise  it was like the tinkling of a bell  this sound proceeded from the garden  it could be heard distinctly though faintly  it resembled the faint  vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures this noise made valjean turn round he looked and saw that there was some one in the garden a being resembling a man was walking amid the bell glasses of the melon beds  rising  stooping  halting  with regular movements  as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground  this person appeared to limp jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy  for them everything is hostile and suspicious  they distrust the day because it enables people to see them  and the night because it aids in surprising them  a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted  and now he shivered because there was some one there he fell back from chimerical terrors to real terrors  he said to himself that javert and the spies had  perhaps  not taken their departure  that they had  no doubt  left people on the watch in the street  that if this man should discover him in the garden  he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up  he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture  which was out of use  in the most remote corner of the shed  cosette did not stir from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch  the strange thing about it was  that the sound of the bell followed each of this man s movements  when the man approached  the sound approached  when the man retreated  the sound retreated  if he made any hasty gesture  a tremolo accompanied the gesture  when he halted  the sound ceased  it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man  but what could that signify  who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox as he put these questions to himself  he touched cosette s hands  they were icy cold ah  good god  he cried he spoke to her in a low voice cosette she did not open her eyes he shook her vigorously she did not wake is she dead  he said to himself  and sprang to his feet  quivering from head to foot the most frightful thoughts rushed pell mell through his mind  there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies  and violently force the partitions of our brains  when those we love are in question  our prudence invents every sort of madness  he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal cosette was pale  and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet  without a movement he listened to her breathing  she still breathed  but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction how was he to warm her back to life  how was he to rouse her  all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts  he rushed wildly from the ruin it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour chapter ix the man with the bell he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden  he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat the man s head was bent down  and he did not see him approaching  in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him jean valjean accosted him with the cry one hundred francs the man gave a start and raised his eyes you can earn a hundred francs  went on jean valjean  if you will grant me shelter for this night the moon shone full upon jean valjean s terrified countenance what  so it is you  father madeleine  said the man that name  thus pronounced  at that obscure hour  in that unknown spot by that strange man  made jean valjean start back he had expected anything but that  the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame old man  dressed almost like a peasant  who wore on his left knee a leather knee cap  whence hung a moderately large bell  his face  which was in the shadow  was not distinguishable however  the goodman had removed his cap  and exclaimed  trembling all over ah  good god  how come you here  father madeleine  where did you enter dieu jesus  did you fall from heaven  there is no trouble about that if ever you do fall  it will be from there  and what a state you are in you have no cravat  you have no hat  you have no coat  do you know  you would have frightened any one who did not know you  no coat  lord god are the saints going mad nowadays  but how did you get in here his words tumbled over each other  the goodman talked with a rustic volubility  in which there was nothing alarming  all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness who are you  and what house is this  demanded jean valjean ah  pardieu  this is too much  exclaimed the old man  i am the person for whom you got the place here  and this house is the one where you had me placed  what  you don t recognize me no  said jean valjean  and how happens it that you know me you saved my life  said the man he turned  a ray of moonlight outlined his profile  and jean valjean recognized old fauchelevent ah  said jean valjean  so it is you  yes  i recollect you that is very lucky  said the old man  in a reproachful tone and what are you doing here  resumed jean valjean why  i am covering my melons  of course in fact  at the moment when jean valjean accosted him  old fauchelevent held in his hand the end of a straw mat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed  during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them  it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean he continued i said to myself  the moon is bright  it is going to freeze  what if i were to put my melons into their greatcoats  and  he added  looking at jean valjean with a broad smile pardieu  you ought to have done the same  but how do you come here jean valjean  finding himself known to this man  at least only under the name of madeleine  thenceforth advanced only with caution  he multiplied his questions  strange to say  their roles seemed to be reversed  it was he  the intruder  who interrogated and what is this bell which you wear on your knee this  replied fauchelevent  is so that i may be avoided what  so that you may be avoided old fauchelevent winked with an indescribable air ah  goodness  there are only women in this house many young girls  it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet  the bell gives them warning  when i come  they go what house is this come  you know well enough but i do not not when you got me the place here as gardener answer me as though i knew nothing well  then  this is the petit picpus convent memories recurred to jean valjean  chance  that is to say  providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine where old fauchelevent  crippled by the fall from his cart  had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously  he repeated  as though talking to himself the petit picpus convent exactly  returned old fauchelevent  but to come to the point  how the deuce did you manage to get in here  you  father madeleine  no matter if you are a saint  you are a man as well  and no man enters here you certainly are here there is no one but me still  said jean valjean  i must stay here ah  good god  cried fauchelevent jean valjean drew near to the old man  and said to him in a grave voice father fauchelevent  i saved your life i was the first to recall it  returned fauchelevent well  you can do to day for me that which i did for you in the olden days fauchelevent took in his aged  trembling  and wrinkled hands jean valjean s two robust hands  and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking  at length he exclaimed oh  that would be a blessing from the good god  if i could make you some little return for that  save your life  monsieur le maire  dispose of the old man a wonderful joy had transfigured this old man  his countenance seemed to emit a ray of light what do you wish me to do  he resumed that i will explain to you  you have a chamber i have an isolated hovel yonder  behind the ruins of the old convent in a corner which no one ever looks into  there are three rooms in it the hut was  in fact  so well hidden behind the ruins  and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen  that jean valjean had not perceived it good  said jean valjean  now i am going to ask two things of you what are they  mr  mayor in the first place  you are not to tell any one what you know about me in the second  you are not to try to find out anything more as you please  i know that you can do nothing that is not honest that you have always been a man after the good god s heart  and then moreover  you it was who placed me here  that concerns you  i am at your service that is settled then  now  come with me  we will go and get the child ah  said fauchelevent  so there is a child he added not a word further  and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master less than half an hour afterwards cosette  who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire  was lying asleep in the old gardener s bed  jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more  his hat which he had flung over the wall  had been found and picked up  while jean valjean was putting on his coat  fauchelevent had removed the bell and kneecap  which now hung on a nail beside a vintage basket that adorned the wall  the two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which fauchelevent had placed a bit of cheese black bread  a bottle of wine  and two glasses  and the old man was saying to jean valjean  as he laid his hand on the latter s knee ah  father madeleine  you did not recognize me immediately  you save people s lives  and then you forget them  that is bad  but they remember you  you are an ingrate chapter x which explains how javert got on the scent the events of which we have just beheld the reverse side  so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner when jean valjean  on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside fantine s death bed  had escaped from the town jail of m  sur m  the police had supposed that he had betaken himself to paris  paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost  and everything disappears in this belly of the world  as in the belly of the sea  no forest hides a man as does that crowd  fugitives of every sort know this  they go to paris as to an abyss  there are gulfs which save  the police know it also  and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere  they sought the ex mayor of m  sur m  javert was summoned to paris to throw light on their researches  javert had  in fact  rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean javert s zeal and intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m  chabouillet  secretary of the prefecture under comte angles  m chabouillet  who had  moreover  already been javert s patron  had the inspector of m  sur m  attached to the police force of paris  there javert rendered himself useful in divers and  though the word may seem strange for such services  honorable manners he no longer thought of jean valjean the wolf of to day causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when in december   he read a newspaper  he who never read newspapers but javert  a monarchical man  had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo  into bayonne  just as he was finishing the article  which interested him  a name  the name of jean valjean  attracted his attention at the bottom of a page  the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead  and published the fact in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it  he confined himself to the remark  that s a good entry  then he threw aside the paper  and thought no more about it some time afterwards  it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the seine et oise to the prefecture of police in paris  concerning the abduction of a child  which had taken place  under peculiar circumstances  as it was said  in the commune of montfermeil a little girl of seven or eight years of age  the report said  who had been intrusted by her mother to an inn keeper of that neighborhood  had been stolen by a stranger  this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantine  who had died in the hospital  it was not known where or when this report came under javert s eye and set him to thinking the name of fantine was well known to him  he remembered that jean valjean had made him  javert  burst into laughter  by asking him for a respite of three days  for the purpose of going to fetch that creature s child  he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for montfermeil some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach  and that he had already  on the previous day  made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village  for he had not been seen in the village itself  what had he been intending to do in that region of montfermeil  it could not even be surmised javert understood it now  fantine s daughter was there  jean valjean was going there in search of her  and now this child had been stolen by a stranger  who could that stranger be  could it be jean valjean  but jean valjean was dead  javert  without saying anything to anybody  took the coach from the pewter platter  cul de sac de la planchette  and made a trip to montfermeil he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there  he found a great deal of obscurity for the first few days the thenardiers had chattered in their rage  the disappearance of the lark had created a sensation in the village  he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story  which ended in the abduction of a child  hence the police report  but their first vexation having passed off  thenardier  with his wonderful instinct  had very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown  and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself  and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand  the glittering eye of justice  the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them  and in the first place  how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received  he turned squarely round  put a gag on his wife s mouth  and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him  he understood nothing about it  no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily  he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness  but her grandfather  had come for her in the most natural way in the world  he added the grandfather  which produced a good effect  this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at montfermeil  the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish nevertheless  javert dropped a few questions  like plummets  into thenardier s history  who was that grandfather  and what was his name thenardier replied with simplicity  he is a wealthy farmer  i saw his passport  i think his name was m  guillaume lambert lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name  thereupon javert returned to paris jean valjean is certainly dead  said he  and i am a ninny he had again begun to forget this history  when  in the course of march   he heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of saint medard and who had been surnamed the mendicant who gives alms this person  the story ran  was a man of means  whose name no one knew exactly  and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years  who knew nothing about herself  save that she had come from montfermeil montfermeil  that name was always coming up  and it made javert prick up his ears  an old beggar police spy  an ex beadle  to whom this person had given alms  added a few more details  this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening  speaking to no one except  occasionally to the poor  and never allowing any one to approach him  he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat  which was worth many millions  being all wadded with bank bills  this piqued javert s curiosity in a decided manner  in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him  he borrowed the beadle s outfit for a day  and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening  whining orisons through his nose  and playing the spy under cover of prayer the suspected individual  did indeed approach javert thus disguised and bestow alms on him  at that moment javert raised his head  and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean however  the darkness might have misled him  jean valjean s death was official  javert cherished very grave doubts  and when in doubt  javert the man of scruples  never laid a finger on any one s collar he followed his man to the gorbeau house  and got the old woman  to talking  which was no difficult matter  the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat lined with millions  and narrated to him the episode of the thousand franc bill  she had seen it  she had handled it  javert hired a room  that evening he installed himself in it  he came and listened at the mysterious lodger s door  hoping to catch the sound of his voice  but jean valjean saw his candle through the key hole  and foiled the spy by keeping silent on the following day jean valjean decamped  but the noise made by the fall of the five franc piece was noticed by the old woman  who  hearing the rattling of coin  suspected that he might be intending to leave  and made haste to warn javert  at night  when jean valjean came out  javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture  but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize  that was his secret  and he had kept it for three reasons  in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next  because  to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead  on a criminal whom justice had formerly classed forever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort  was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a new comer like javert  and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict  and lastly  because javert  being an artist  had a taste for the unforeseen  he hated those well heralded successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off  he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil them suddenly at the last javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree  then from corner to corner of the street  and had not lost sight of him for a single instant  even at the moments when jean valjean believed himself to be the most secure javert s eye had been on him  why had not javert arrested jean valjean  because he was still in doubt it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease  the free press embarrassed it  several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers  had echoed even as far as the chambers  and had rendered the prefecture timid  interference with individual liberty was a grave matter  the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on them  a mistake meant dismissal  the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph  reproduced by twenty newspapers  would have caused in paris  yesterday  an aged grandfather  with white hair  a respectable and well to do gentleman who was walking with his grandchild  aged eight  was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict let us repeat in addition that javert had scruples of his own injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect  he was really in doubt jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark sadness  uneasiness  anxiety  depression  this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night  to seek a chance refuge in paris for cosette and himself  the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child all this  without his being aware of it  had altered jean valjean s walk  and impressed on his bearing such senility  that the police themselves  incarnate in the person of javert  might  and did in fact  make a mistake  the impossibility of approaching too close  his costume of an emigre preceptor  the declaration of thenardier which made a grandfather of him  and  finally  the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in javert s mind for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers  but if the man was not jean valjean  and if this man was not a good  honest old fellow living on his income  he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds  some chief of a dangerous band  who gave alms to conceal his other talents  which was an old dodge  he had trusty fellows accomplices  retreats in case of emergencies  in which he would  no doubt  take refuge  all these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man  to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs  where was the inconvenience in waiting  javert was very sure that he would not escape thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind  putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise  that  thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a dram shop  he decidedly recognized jean valjean there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tiger who recovers his prey javert gave that profound start as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean  the formidable convict  he perceived that there were only three of them  and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise  one puts on gloves before grasping a thorn cudgel this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail  he speedily divined however  that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself  he bent his head and reflected like a blood hound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent  javert  with his powerful rectitude of instinct  went straight to the bridge of austerlitz  a word with the toll keeper furnished him with the information which he required  have you seen a man with a little girl  i made him pay two sous  replied the toll keeper  javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water  leading cosette by the hand  he saw him enter the rue du chemin vert saint antoine  he remembered the cul de sac genrot arranged there like a trap  and of the sole exit of the rue droit mur into the rue petit picpus  he made sure of his back burrows  as huntsmen say  he hastily despatched one of his agents  by a roundabout way  to guard that issue  a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him  he made a requisition on it  and caused it to accompany him  in such games soldiers are aces moreover  the principle is  that in order to get the best of a wild boar  one must employ the science of venery and plenty of dogs  these combinations having been effected  feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley genrot on the right  his agent on the left  and himself  javert  in the rear  he took a pinch of snuff then he began the game  he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead  knowing that he had him safe  but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible  happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free  gloating over him with his gaze  with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter  and of the cat which lets the mouse run claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers  what a delight this strangling is javert was enjoying himself  the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted he was sure of success  all he had to do now was to close his hand accompanied as he was  the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous  energetic  and desperate jean valjean might be illustration  javert on the hunt  b javert on the hunt javert advanced slowly  sounding  searching on his way all the nooks of the street like so many pockets of thieves when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there his exasperation can be imagined he interrogated his sentinel of the rues droit mur and petit picpus that agent  who had remained imperturbably at his post  had not seen the man pass it sometimes happens that a stag is lost head and horns  that is to say  he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels  and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say  duvivier  ligniville  and desprez halt short  in a discomfiture of this sort  artonge exclaims  it was not a stag  but a sorcerer  javert would have liked to utter the same cry his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india  that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa  that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia  and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean valjean  he was wrong  perhaps  in hesitating in his recognition of the exconvict  the first glance should have sufficed him  he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building  he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise  he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin  advice is certainly useful  it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence  but the hunter cannot be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict  javert  by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail  alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart  and so made him run  above all  he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz  he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread  he thought himself stronger than he was  and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion  at the same time  he reckoned himself as too weak  when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement  fatal precaution  waste of precious time  javert committed all these blunders and none the less was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed  he was  in the full force of the term  what is called in venery a knowing dog  but what is there that is perfect great strategists have their eclipses the greatest follies are often composed  like the largest ropes  of a multitude of strands  take the cable thread by thread  take all the petty determining motives separately  and you can break them one after the other  and you say  that is all there is of it  braid them  twist them together  the result is enormous  it is attila hesitating between marcian on the east and valentinian on the west  it is hannibal tarrying at capua  it is danton falling asleep at arcis sur aube however that may be  even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him  javert did not lose his head  sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be far off  he established sentinels  he organized traps and ambuscades  and beat the quarter all that night  the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut  a precious sign which  however  led him astray  since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the cul de sac genrot  in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of waste land jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction  the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the cul de sac genrot  he would probably have done so and have been lost  javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook  and returned to the prefecture of police  as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been book sixth le petit picpus chapter i number  rue petit picpus nothing  half a century ago  more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of number  rue petit picpus  this entrance which usually stood ajar in the most inviting fashion  permitted a view of two things  neither of which have anything very funereal about them a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines  and the face of a lounging porter  above the wall  at the bottom of the court  tall trees were visible  when a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard  when a glass of wine cheered up the porter  it was difficult to pass number  little picpus street without carrying away a smiling impression of it  nevertheless  it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse the threshold smiled  the house prayed and wept if one succeeded in passing the porter  which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for every one  for there was an open sesame which it was necessary to know if  the porter once passed  one entered a little vestibule on the right  on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time  if one did not allow one s self to be alarmed by a daubing of canary yellow  with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase  if one ventured to ascend it  one crossed a first landing  then a second and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows  the corridor took a turn and became dark  if one doubled this cape  one arrived a few paces further on  in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened  if one opened it  one found one s self in a little chamber about six feet square  tiled well scrubbed  clean  cold  and hung with nankin paper with green flowers  at fifteen sous the roll  a white  dull light fell from a large window  with tiny panes  on the left  which usurped the whole width of the room  one gazed about  but saw no one  one listened  one heard neither a footstep nor a human murmur  the walls were bare  the chamber was not furnished  there was not even a chair one looked again  and beheld on the wall facing the door a quadrangular hole  about a foot square  with a grating of interlacing iron bars black  knotted  solid  which formed squares i had almost said meshes of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length  the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars  without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact  supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole  this grating would have prevented it  it did not allow the passage of the body  but it did allow the passage of the eyes  that is to say  of the mind  this seems to have occurred to them  for it had been re enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer  at the bottom of this plate  an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box  a bit of tape attached to a bell wire hung at the right of the grated opening if the tape was pulled  a bell rang  and one heard a voice very near at hand  which made one start who is there  the voice demanded it was a woman s voice  a gentle voice  so gentle that it was mournful here  again  there was a magical word which it was necessary to know  if one did not know it  the voice ceased  the wall became silent once more as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it if one knew the password  the voice resumed  enter on the right one then perceived on the right  facing the window  a glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray  on raising the latch and crossing the threshold  one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire  before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted  one was  in fact  in a sort of theatre box  narrow  furnished with two old chairs  and a much frayed straw matting  sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass door  a regular box  with its front just of a height to lean upon  bearing a tablet of black wood  this box was grated  only the grating of it was not of gilded wood  as at the opera  it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars  hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists the first minutes passed  when one s eyes began to grow used to this cellar like half twilight  one tried to pass the grating  but got no further than six inches beyond it  there he encountered a barrier of black shutters  re enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow  these shutters were divided into long narrow slats  and they masked the entire length of the grating  they were always closed  at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters  and saying i am here  what do you wish with me it was a beloved  sometimes an adored  voice  no one was visible  hardly the sound of a breath was audible  it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked  that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the slat of one of the shutters opened opposite you  the evoked spirit became an apparition  behind the grating  behind the shutter  one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight  a head  of which only the mouth and the chin were visible  the rest was covered with a black veil  one caught a glimpse of a black guimpe  and a form that was barely defined  covered with a black shroud  that head spoke with you  but did not look at you and never smiled at you the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white  and she saw you in the black  this light was symbolical nevertheless  your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances  a profound vagueness enveloped that form clad in mourning  your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition  at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing  what you beheld was night  emptiness  shadows  a wintry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb  a sort of terrible peace  a silence from which you could gather nothing  not even sighs  a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing  not even phantoms what you beheld was the interior of a cloister it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardines of the perpetual adoration  the box in which you stood was the parlor  the first voice which had addressed you was that of the portress who always sat motionless and silent  on the other side of the wall  near the square opening  screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes  as by a double visor the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor  which had a window on the side of the world  had none on the side of the convent  profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place nevertheless  there was something beyond that shadow  there was a light there was life in the midst of that death  although this was the most strictly walled of all convents  we shall endeavor to make our way into it  and to take the reader in  and to say  without transgressing the proper bounds  things which story tellers have never seen  and have therefore  never described chapter ii the obedience of martin verga this convent  which in  had already existed for many a long year in the rue petit picpus  was a community of bernardines of the obedience of martin verga these bernardines were attached  in consequence  not to clairvaux  like the bernardine monks  but to citeaux  like the benedictine monks  in other words  they were the subjects  not of saint bernard  but of saint benoit any one who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in  a congregation of bernardines benedictines with salamanca for the head of the order  and alcala as the branch establishment this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of europe there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one order on another  to mention only a single order of saint benoit  which is here in question  there are attached to this order  without counting the obedience of martin verga  four congregations two in italy mont cassin and sainte justine of padua  two in france  cluny and saint maur  and nine orders vallombrosa  granmont  the celestins the camaldules  the carthusians  the humilies  the olivateurs  the silvestrins  and lastly  citeaux  for citeaux itself  a trunk for other orders  is only an offshoot of saint benoit  citeaux dates from saint robert  abbe de molesme  in the diocese of langres  in  now it was in  that the devil  having retired to the desert of subiaco he was old had he turned hermit was chased from the ancient temple of apollo  where he dwelt  by saint benoit  then aged seventeen after the rule of the carmelites  who go barefoot  wear a bit of willow on their throats  and never sit down  the harshest rule is that of the bernardines benedictines of martin verga  they are clothed in black with a guimpe  which  in accordance with the express command of saint benoit  mounts to the chin  a robe of serge with large sleeves a large woollen veil  the guimpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast  the band which descends over their brow to their eyes this is their dress  all is black except the band  which is white  the novices wear the same habit  but all in white  the professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side the bernardines benedictines of martin verga practise the perpetual adoration  like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament who  at the beginning of this century  had two houses in paris one at the temple  the other in the rue neuve sainte genevieve  however  the bernardines benedictines of the petit picpus  of whom we are speaking were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament cloistered in the rue neuve sainte genevieve and at the temple  there were numerous differences in their rule  there were some in their costume  the bernardines benedictines of the petit picpus wore the black guimpe  and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the rue neuve sainte genevieve wore a white one  and had  besides  on their breasts  a holy sacrament about three inches long  in silver gilt or gilded copper  the nuns of the petit picpus did not wear this holy sacrament  the perpetual adoration  which was common to the house of the petit picpus and to the house of the temple  leaves those two orders perfectly distinct  their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardines of martin verga  just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy  the life  and death of jesus christ and the virgin  between the two orders  which were  nevertheless widely separated  and on occasion even hostile  the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de neri  and the oratory of france established by pierre de berulle  the oratory of france claimed the precedence  since philip de neri was only a saint  while berulle was a cardinal let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verga the bernardines benedictines of this obedience fast all the year round  abstain from meat  fast in lent and on many other days which are peculiar to them  rise from their first sleep  from one to three o clock in the morning  to read their breviary and chant matins  sleep in all seasons between serge sheets and on straw  make no use of the bath never light a fire  scourge themselves every friday  observe the rule of silence  speak to each other only during the recreation hours  which are very brief  and wear drugget chemises for six months in the year  from september th  which is the exaltation of the holy cross  until easter these six months are a modification  the rule says all the year  but this drugget chemise  intolerable in the heat of summer  produced fevers and nervous spasms  the use of it had to be restricted  even with this palliation  when the nuns put on this chemise on the th of september they suffer from fever for three or four days  obedience  poverty chastity  perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows  which the rule greatly aggravates the prioress is elected for three years by the mothers  who are called meres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter  a prioress can only be re elected twice  which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years they never see the officiating priest  who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height  during the sermon  when the preacher is in the chapel  they drop their veils over their faces  they must always speak low  walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed  one man only is allowed to enter the convent the archbishop of the diocese there is really one other the gardener  but he is always an old man and  in order that he may always be alone in the garden  and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him  a bell is attached to his knee their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive  it is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation  as at the voice of christ  ut voci christi  at a gesture  at the first sign ad nutum  ad primum signum  immediately  with cheerfulness  with perseverance  with a certain blind obedience  prompte  hilariter perseveranter et caeca quadam obedientia  as the file in the hand of the workman  quasi limam in manibus fabri  without power to read or to write without express permission  legere vel scribere non addiscerit sine expressa superioris licentia each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation  the reparation is the prayer for all the sins  for all the faults  for all the dissensions  for all the violations  for all the iniquities  for all the crimes committed on earth  for the space of twelve consecutive hours from four o clock in the afternoon till four o clock in the morning  or from four o clock in the morning until four o clock in the afternoon the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone before the holy sacrament  with hands clasped  a rope around her neck when her fatigue becomes unendurable  she prostrates herself flat on her face against the earth  with her arms outstretched in the form of a cross  this is her only relief  in this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe  this is great to sublimity as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle  it is called without distinction  to make reparation or to be at the post the nuns even prefer  out of humility  this last expression  which contains an idea of torture and abasement to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her besides this  there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament  this station lasts an hour  they relieve each other like soldiers on guard  this is the perpetual adoration the prioresses and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity  recalling  not the saints and martyrs  but moments in the life of jesus christ  as mother nativity  mother conception mother presentation  mother passion  but the names of saints are not interdicted when one sees them  one never sees anything but their mouths all their teeth are yellow  no tooth brush ever entered that convent brushing one s teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one s soul they never say my  they possess nothing of their own  and they must not attach themselves to anything  they call everything our  thus  our veil our chaplet  if they were speaking of their chemise  they would say our chemise  sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours  a relic  a medal that has been blessed  as soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object  they must give it up  they recall the words of saint therese  to whom a great lady said as she was on the point of entering her order  permit me  mother  to send for a bible to which i am greatly attached  ah  you are attached to something  in that case  do not enter our order every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up  to have a place of her own  a chamber  they live with their cells open  when they meet one says  blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar the other responds  forever  the same ceremony when one taps at the other s door  hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard to say hastily  forever  like all practices  this becomes mechanical by force of habit  and one sometimes says forever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence  praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar among the visitandines the one who enters says  ave maria  and the one whose cell is entered says  gratia plena  it is their way of saying good day  which is in fact full of grace at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent  at this signal prioress  vocal mothers professed nuns  lay sisters  novices  postulants  interrupt what they are saying  what they are doing  or what they are thinking  and all say in unison if it is five o clock  for instance  at five o clock and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar if it is eight o clock  at eight o clock and at all hours  and so on according to the hour this custom  the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god  exists in many communities  the formula alone varies  thus at the infant jesus they say  at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kindle my heart  the bernardines benedictines of martin verga  cloistered fifty years ago at petit picpus  chant the offices to a solemn psalmody  a pure gregorian chant  and always with full voice during the whole course of the office everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause  and say in a low voice  jesus marie joseph  for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth  the effect produced is striking and tragic the nuns of the petit picpus had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community  the government  as they say  does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die  this is an affliction to them  and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules they had obtained a mediocre consolation at best permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemetery  which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community on fridays the nuns hear high mass  vespers  and all the offices  as on sunday  they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world  of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days  and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy  their stations in the chapel are interminable  as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenuous remark of one of them  the prayers of the postulants are frightful  the prayers of the novices are still worse  and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse once a week the chapter assembles  the prioress presides  the vocal mothers assist  each sister kneels in turn on the stones  and confesses aloud  in the presence of all  the faults and sins which she has committed during the week  the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud besides this confession in a loud tone  for which all faults in the least serious are reserved  they have for their venial offences what they call the coulpe  to make one s coulpe means to prostrate one s self flat on one s face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter  who is never called anything but our mother  notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the wood of her stall that she can rise  the coulpe or peccavi  is made for a very small matter a broken glass  a torn veil  an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office  a false note in church  etc  this suffices  and the coulpe is made  the coulpe is entirely spontaneous  it is the culpable person herself the word is etymologically in its place here  who judges herself and inflicts it on herself  on festival days and sundays four mother precentors intone the offices before a large reading desk with four places  one day one of the mother precentors intoned a psalm beginning with ecce  and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do si sol  for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent a coulpe which lasted during the whole service  what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed when a nun is summoned to the parlor  even were it the prioress herself she drops her veil  as will be remembered  so that only her mouth is visible the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers  the others can see only their immediate family  and that very rarely  if  by chance an outsider presents herself to see a nun  or one whom she has known and loved in the outer world  a regular series of negotiations is required if it is a woman  the authorization may sometimes be granted  the nun comes  and they talk to her through the shutters  which are opened only for a mother or sister  it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men such is the rule of saint benoit  aggravated by martin verga these nuns are not gay  rosy  and fresh  as the daughters of other orders often are  they are pale and grave  between  and  three of them went mad chapter iii austerities one is a postulant for two years at least  often for four  a novice for four  it is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty three or twenty four years  the bernardines benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order in their cells  they deliver themselves up to many unknown macerations of which they must never speak on the day when a novice makes her profession  she is dressed in her handsomest attire  she is crowned with white roses  her hair is brushed until it shines  and curled  then she prostrates herself  a great black veil is thrown over her  and the office for the dead is sung  then the nuns separate into two files  one file passes close to her  saying in plaintive accents  our sister is dead  and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy  our sister is alive in jesus christ at the epoch when this story takes place  a boarding school was attached to the convent a boarding school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families  among whom could be remarked mademoiselle de saint aulaire and de belissen  and an english girl bearing the illustrious catholic name of talbot  these young girls  reared by these nuns between four walls  grew up with a horror of the world and of the age  one of them said to us one day  the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot  they were dressed in blue  with a white cap and a holy spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast on certain grand festival days  particularly saint martha s day  they were permitted  as a high favor and a supreme happiness  to dress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of saint benoit for a whole day  in the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments  this seemed profane  and the prioress forbade it  only the novices were permitted to lend  it is remarkable that these performances  tolerated and encouraged  no doubt in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit  were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars  they simply amused themselves with it  it was new  it gave them a change  candid reasons of childhood  which do not  however  succeed in making us worldlings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one s hand and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of a reading desk the pupils conformed  with the exception of the austerities  to all the practices of the convent  there was a certain young woman who entered the world  and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever any one knocked at her door  forever  like the nuns  the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor  their very mothers did not obtain permission to embrace them  the following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried  one day a young girl received a visit from her mother  who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age  the young girl wept  for she wished greatly to embrace her sister  impossible  she begged that  at least  the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could kiss it  this was almost indignantly refused chapter iv gayeties none the less  these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister  the recreation hour struck  a door swung on its hinges  the birds said  good here come the children  an irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with a cross like a shroud  radiant faces  white foreheads innocent eyes  full of merry light  all sorts of auroras  were scattered about amid these shadows  after the psalmodies  the bells  the peals and knells and offices  the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise of bees  the hive of joy was opened and each one brought her honey  they played  they called to each other they formed into groups  they ran about  pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners  the veils superintended the laughs from a distance  shades kept watch of the sunbeams  but what mattered it  still they beamed and laughed  those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy  they looked on  vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweet swarming of the hives  it was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning  the young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns  the gaze of impeccability does not embarrass innocence  thanks to these children  there was among so many austere hours  one hour of ingenuousness  the little ones skipped about  the elder ones danced  in this cloister play was mingled with heaven  nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh expanding young souls  homer would have come thither to laugh with perrault  and there was in that black garden  youth  health  noise cries  giddiness  pleasure  happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ancestresses  those of the epic as well as those of the fairy tale  those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from hecuba to la mere grand in that house more than anywhere else  perhaps  arise those children s sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of thoughtfulness  it was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day  mother  one of the big girls has just told me that i have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here  what happiness it was here  too  that this memorable dialogue took place a vocal mother  why are you weeping  my child the child aged six  i told alix that i knew my french history  she says that i do not know it  but i do alix  the big girl aged nine  no  she does not know it the mother  how is that  my child alix  she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book  and she would answer it well she did not answer it let us see about it  what did you ask her i opened the book at random  as she proposed  and i put the first question that i came across and what was the question it was  what happened after that it was there that that profound remark was made anent a rather greedy paroquet which belonged to a lady boarder how well bred  it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just like a person it was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once picked up a confession which had been written out in advance  in order that she might not forget it  by a sinner of seven years father  i accuse myself of having been avaricious father  i accuse myself of having been an adulteress father  i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen it was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the following tale  which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years there were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a great many flowers  they plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets  after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings  there was a wolf in that country  there was a great deal of forest  and the wolf was in the forest  and he ate the little cocks and this other poem there came a blow with a stick it was punchinello who bestowed it on the cat it was not good for her  it hurt her then a lady put punchinello in prison it was there that a little abandoned child  a foundling whom the convent was bringing up out of charity  uttered this sweet and heart breaking saying  she heard the others talking of their mothers  and she murmured in her corner as for me  my mother was not there when i was born there was a stout portress who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys  and whose name was sister agatha  the big big girls those over ten years of age called her agathocles the refectory  a large apartment of an oblong square form  which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden  was dark and damp  and  as the children say  full of beasts  all the places round about furnished their contingent of insects each of its four corners had received  in the language of the pupils a special and expressive name  there was spider corner  caterpillar corner  wood louse corner  and cricket corner cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed  it was not so cold there as elsewhere  from the refectory the names had passed to the boarding school  and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations  every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals  one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the class room through which he was passing he inquired of another pupil  a charming brunette with rosy cheeks  who stood near him who is that she is a spider  monseigneur bah  and that one yonder she is a cricket and that one she is a caterpillar really  and yourself i am a wood louse  monseigneur every house of this sort has its own peculiarities  at the beginning of this century ecouen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august  at ecouen  in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament a distinction was made between virgins and florists  there were also the dais  and the censors the first who held the cords of the dais  and the others who carried incense before the holy sacrament  the flowers belonged by right to the florists  four virgins  walked in advance  on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory  who is a virgin madame campan used to quote this saying of a little one  of seven years  to a big girl  of sixteen  who took the head of the procession while she  the little one  remained at the rear  you are a virgin  but i am not chapter v distractions above the door of the refectory this prayer  which was called the white paternoster  and which possessed the property of bearing people straight to paradise  was inscribed in large black letters little white paternoster  which god made  which god said  which god placed in paradise  in the evening  when i went to bed  i found three angels sitting on my bed  one at the foot  two at the head  the good virgin mary in the middle  who told me to lie down without hesitation the good god is my father  the good virgin is my mother  the three apostles are my brothers  the three virgins are my sisters  the shirt in which god was born envelopes my body  saint margaret s cross is written on my breast  madame the virgin was walking through the meadows  weeping for god  when she met m  saint john  monsieur saint john  whence come you  i come from ave salus  you have not seen the good god  where is he  he is on the tree of the cross  his feet hanging  his hands nailed  a little cap of white thorns on his head  whoever shall say this thrice at eventide  thrice in the morning  shall win paradise at the last in  this characteristic orison had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of daubing paint  at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then  and who are old women now a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory  whose only door  as we think we have mentioned  opened on the garden  two narrow tables  each flanked by two wooden benches  formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory the walls were white  the tables were black  these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents  the meals were plain  and the food of the children themselves severe  a single dish of meat and vegetables combined  or salt fish such was their luxury  this meagre fare  which was reserved for the pupils alone  was  nevertheless  an exception  the children ate in silence  under the eye of the mother whose turn it was  who  if a fly took a notion to fly or to hum against the rule  opened and shut a wooden book from time to time  this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints  read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk  which was situated at the foot of the crucifix  the reader was one of the big girls  in weekly turn  at regular distances on the bare tables  there were large  varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forks  and into which they sometimes threw some scrap of tough meat or spoiled fish  this was punished  these bowls were called ronds d eau  the child who broke the silence made a cross with her tongue  where  on the ground  she licked the pavement  the dust  that end of all joys  was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose leaves which had been guilty of chirping there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy  and which it is forbidden to read  it is the rule of saint benoit  an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate  nemo regulas  seu constitutiones nostras  externis communicabit the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book  and set to reading it with avidity  a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught  which caused them to close the volume precipitately from the great danger thus incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure  the most interesting thing  they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby fruit trees  in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered  when the wind had shaken the trees  they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sly  i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me  a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil  now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris  i quote literally  one hides one s pear or one s apple as best one may  when one goes up stairs to put the veil on the bed before supper  one stuffs them under one s pillow and at night one eats them in bed  and when one cannot do that  one eats them in the closet  that was one of their greatest luxuries once it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls  mademoiselle bouchard  who was connected with the montmorency family  laid a wager that she would ask for a day s leave of absence an enormity in so austere a community  the wager was accepted  but not one of those who bet believed that she would do it  when the moment came  as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils  mademoiselle bouchard  to the indescribable terror of her companions  stepped out of the ranks  and said  monseigneur  a day s leave of absence  mademoiselle bouchard was tall  blooming  with the prettiest little rosy face in the world  m  de quelen smiled and said what  my dear child  a day s leave of absence  three days if you like i grant you three days  the prioress could do nothing  the archbishop had spoken  horror of the convent  but joy of the pupil  the effect may be imagined this stern cloister was not so well walled off  however  but that the life of the passions of the outside world  drama  and even romance did not make their way in  to prove this  we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which  however  bears no reference in itself to  and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating  we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader s mind about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun  who was treated with great respect  and who was addressed as madame albertine  nothing was known about her  save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead  beneath this history it was said there lay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage this woman  hardly thirty years of age  of dark complexion and tolerably pretty  had a vague look in her large black eyes  could she see  there was some doubt about this  she glided rather than walked  she never spoke  it was not quite known whether she breathed  her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh  to touch her hand was like touching snow  she possessed a strange spectral grace wherever she entered  people felt cold  one day a sister  on seeing her pass  said to another sister  she passes for a dead woman  perhaps she is one  replied the other a hundred tales were told of madame albertine  this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils  in the chapel there was a gallery called l oeil de boeuf  it was in this gallery  which had only a circular bay  an oeil de boeuf  that madame albertine listened to the offices  she always occupied it alone because from this gallery  being on the level of the first story  the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen  which was interdicted to the nuns  one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank  m  le duc de rohan  peer of france  officer of the red musketeers in  when he was prince de leon  and who died afterward  in  as cardinal and archbishop of besancon  it was the first time that m  de rohan had preached at the petit picpus convent  madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services  that day  as soon as she caught sight of m  de rohan  she half rose  and said  in a loud voice  amid the silence of the chapel  ah  auguste the whole community turned their heads in amazement  the preacher raised his eyes  but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility  a breath from the outer world  a flash of life  had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished  and the mad woman had become a corpse again those two words  however  had set every one in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering  how many things were contained in that ah  auguste  what revelations  m  de rohan s name really was auguste  it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society  since she knew m  de rohan  and that her own rank there was of the highest  since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a lord and that there existed between them some connection  of relationship perhaps  but a very close one in any case  since she knew his pet name two very severe duchesses  mesdames de choiseul and de serent  often visited the community  whither they penetrated  no doubt  in virtue of the privilege magnates mulieres  and caused great consternation in the boarding school  when these two old ladies passed by  all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes moreover  m  de rohan  quite unknown to himself  was an object of attention to the school girls  at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate  vicar general of the archbishop of paris  it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the petit picpus  not one of the young recluses could see him  because of the serge curtain  but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice  which they had come to know and to distinguish  he had been a mousquetaire  and then  he was said to be very coquettish  that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head  and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moire  and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world  he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years not a sound from without made its way into the convent  but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither  this was an event  and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall it it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood  this flute always played the same air  an air which is very far away nowadays my zetulbe  come reign o er my soul and it was heard two or three times a day  the young girls passed hours in listening to it  the vocal mothers were upset by it  brains were busy  punishments descended in showers  this lasted for several months  the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician  each one dreamed that she was zetulbe  the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue droit mur  and they would have given anything  compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing  of catching a glance  if only for a second  of the young man  who played that flute so deliciously and who  no doubt  played on all these souls at the same time  there were some who made their escape by a back door  and ascended to the third story on the rue droit mur side  in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps  impossible  one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating  and to wave her white handkerchief  two were still bolder  they found means to climb on a roof  and risked their lives there  and succeeded at last in seeing the young man  he was an old emigre gentleman  blind and penniless  who was playing his flute in his attic  in order to pass the time chapter vi the little convent in this enclosure of the petit picpus there were three perfectly distinct buildings the great convent  inhabited by the nuns  the boarding school  where the scholars were lodged  and lastly  what was called the little convent  it was a building with a garden  in which lived all sorts of aged nuns of various orders  the relics of cloisters destroyed in the revolution  a reunion of all the black  gray  and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties  what might be called  if such a coupling of words is permissible  a sort of harlequin convent when the empire was established  all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the bernardines benedictines  the government paid them a small pension  the ladies of the petit picpus received them cordially  it was a singular pell mell  each followed her own rule  sometimes the pupils of the boarding school were allowed  as a great recreation  to pay them a visit  the result is  that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of mother sainte bazile  mother sainte scolastique  and mother jacob one of these refugees found herself almost at home  she was a nun of sainte aure  the only one of her order who had survived  the ancient convent of the ladies of sainte aure occupied  at the beginning of the eighteenth century  this very house of the petit picpus  which belonged later to the benedictines of martin verga  this holy woman  too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order  which was a white robe with a scarlet scapulary  had piously put it on a little manikin  which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death  in  only one nun of this order remained  to day  there remains only a doll in addition to these worthy mothers  some old society women had obtained permission of the prioress  like madame albertine  to retire into the little convent  among the number were madame beaufort d hautpoul and marquise dufresne  another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose  the pupils called her madame vacarmini hubbub about  or  madame de genlis  who was at that time editing a little periodical publication called l intrepide  asked to be allowed to enter the convent of the petit picpus as lady resident  the duc d orleans recommended her  uproar in the hive  the vocal mothers were all in a flutter  madame de genlis had made romances  but she declared that she was the first to detest them  and then  she had reached her fierce stage of devotion  with the aid of god  and of the prince  she entered  she departed at the end of six or eight months  alleging as a reason  that there was no shade in the garden  the nuns were delighted although very old  she still played the harp  and did it very well when she went away she left her mark in her cell  madame de genlis was superstitious and a latinist  these two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her  a few years ago  there were still to be seen  pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels  these five lines in latin  written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper  and which  in her opinion possessed the property of frightening away robbers                imparibus meritis pendent tria corpora ramis                dismas et gesmas  media est divina potestas                alta petit dismas  infelix  infima  gesmas                nos et res nostras conservet summa potestas                hos versus dicas  ne tu furto tua perdas these verses in sixth century latin raise the question whether the two thieves of calvary were named  as is commonly believed  dismas and gestas  or dismas and gesmas  this orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century by the vicomte de gestas  of a descent from the wicked thief  however  the useful virtue attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospitallers the church of the house  constructed in such a manner as to separate the great convent from the boarding school like a veritable intrenchment was  of course  common to the boarding school  the great convent  and the little convent  the public was even admitted by a sort of lazaretto entrance on the street  but all was so arranged  that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand  and folded in such a manner as to form  not  as in ordinary churches  a prolongation behind the altar  but a sort of hall  or obscure cellar  to the right of the officiating priest  suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height  of which we have already spoken  in the shadow of that curtain  pile up on wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left  the school girls on the right  the lay sisters and the novices at the bottom  and you will have some idea of the nuns of the petit picpus assisting at divine service  that cavern  which was called the choir  communicated with the cloister by a lobby  the church was lighted from the garden  when the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined silence  the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling chapter vii some silhouettes of this darkness during the six years which separate  from  the prioress of the petit picpus was mademoiselle de blemeur  whose name  in religion was mother innocente  she came of the family of marguerite de blemeur author of lives of the saints of the order of saint benoit  she had been re elected  she was a woman about sixty years of age  short  thick singing like a cracked pot  says the letter which we have already quoted  an excellent woman  moreover  and the only merry one in the whole convent  and for that reason adored  she was learned  erudite wise  competent  curiously proficient in history  crammed with latin stuffed with greek  full of hebrew  and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine nun the sub prioress was an old spanish nun  mother cineres  who was almost blind the most esteemed among the vocal mothers were mother sainte honorine the treasurer  mother sainte gertrude  the chief mistress of the novices  mother saint ange  the assistant mistress  mother annonciation the sacristan  mother saint augustin  the nurse  the only one in the convent who was malicious  then mother sainte mechtilde mademoiselle gauvain  very young and with a beautiful voice  mother des anges mademoiselle drouet  who had been in the convent of the filles dieu and in the convent du tresor  between gisors and magny  mother saint joseph mademoiselle de cogolludo  mother sainte adelaide mademoiselle d auverney  mother misericorde mademoiselle de cifuentes  who could not resist austerities  mother compassion mademoiselle de la miltiere  received at the age of sixty in defiance of the rule  and very wealthy  mother providence mademoiselle de laudiniere  mother presentation mademoiselle de siguenza  who was prioress in  and finally  mother sainte celigne sister of the sculptor ceracchi  who went mad  mother sainte chantal mademoiselle de suzon  who went mad there was also  among the prettiest of them  a charming girl of three and twenty  who was from the isle de bourbon  a descendant of the chevalier roze  whose name had been mademoiselle roze  and who was called mother assumption mother sainte mechtilde  intrusted with the singing and the choir  was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter  she usually took a complete scale of them  that is to say  seven  from ten to sixteen years of age  inclusive  of assorted voices and sizes  whom she made sing standing  drawn up in a line  side by side  according to age  from the smallest to the largest  this presented to the eye  something in the nature of a reed pipe of young girls  a sort of living pan pipe made of angels those of the lay sisters whom the scholars loved most were sister euphrasie  sister sainte marguerite  sister sainte marthe  who was in her dotage  and sister sainte michel  whose long nose made them laugh all these women were gentle with the children  the nuns were severe only towards themselves  no fire was lighted except in the school  and the food was choice compared to that in the convent  moreover  they lavished a thousand cares on their scholars  only  when a child passed near a nun and addressed her  the nun never replied this rule of silence had had this effect  that throughout the whole convent  speech had been withdrawn from human creatures  and bestowed on inanimate objects  now it was the church bell which spoke  now it was the gardener s bell  a very sonorous bell  placed beside the portress and which was audible throughout the house  indicated by its varied peals  which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph  all the actions of material life which were to be performed  and summoned to the parlor  in case of need  such or such an inhabitant of the house  each person and each thing had its own peal  the prioress had one and one  the sub prioress one and two  six five announced lessons  so that the pupils never said to go to lessons  but to go to six five  four four was madame de genlis s signal  it was very often heard  c est le diable a quatre it s the very deuce said the uncharitable  tennine strokes announced a great event  it was the opening of the door of seclusion a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its hinges in the presence of the archbishop with the exception of the archbishop and the gardener  no man entered the convent  as we have already said  the schoolgirls saw two others one  the chaplain  the abbe banes  old and ugly  whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir  through a grating  the other the drawing master  m  ansiaux  whom the letter  of which we have perused a few lines  calls m  anciot  and describes as a frightful old hunchback it will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen such was this curious house chapter viii post corda lapides after having sketched its moral face  it will not prove unprofitable to point out  in a few words  its material configuration  the reader already has some idea of it the convent of the petit picpus sainte antoine filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the rue polonceau  the rue droit mur  the rue petit picpus  and the unused lane called rue aumarais on old plans  these four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat  the convent was composed of several buildings and a garden  the principal building  taken in its entirety  was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which  viewed from a bird s eye view  outlined  with considerable exactness  a gibbet laid flat on the ground  the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue droit mur comprised between the rue petit picpus and the rue polonceau  the lesser arm was a lofty  gray  severe grated facade which faced the rue petit picpus  the carriage entrance no   marked its extremity  towards the centre of this facade was a low  arched door whitened with dust and ashes  where the spiders wove their webs and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays  and on rare occasions  when the coffin of a nun left the convent  this was the public entrance of the church  the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants  hall  and which the nuns called the buttery  in the main arm were the cells of the mothers  the sisters  and the novices  in the lesser arm lay the kitchens  the refectory  backed up by the cloisters and the church  between the door no   and the corner of the closed lane aumarais  was the school  which was not visible from without  the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden which was much lower than the level of the rue polonceau  which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside  the garden  which was slightly arched  had in its centre  on the summit of a hillock  a fine pointed and conical fir tree  whence ran  as from the peaked boss of a shield  four grand alleys  and  ranged by twos in between the branchings of these  eight small ones  so that  if the enclosure had been circular  the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel  as the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden  they were of unequal length they were bordered with currant bushes  at the bottom  an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent  which was at the angle of the rue droit mur to the house of the little convent  which was at the angle of the aumarais lane  in front of the little convent was what was called the little garden  to this whole  let the reader add a courtyard all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings  prison walls  the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the rue polonceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood  and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the bernardines of the petit picpus was forty years ago  this holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century  which was called the tennis ground of the eleven thousand devils all these streets  moreover  were more ancient than paris  these names droit mur and aumarais  are very ancient  the streets which bear them are very much more ancient still  aumarais lane was called maugout lane the rue droit mur was called the rue des eglantiers  for god opened flowers before man cut stones chapter ix a century under a guimpe since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the petit picpus was in former times  and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat  the reader will permit us one other little digression  utterly foreign to this book  but characteristic and useful  since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fontevrault  she had even been in society before the revolution  she talked a great deal of m  de miromesnil  keeper of the seals under louis xvi  and of a presidentess duplat  with whom she had been very intimate it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext  she told wonders of the abbey of fontevrault that it was like a city  and that there were streets in the monastery she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils  every year she solemnly renewed her vows  and at the moment of taking the oath  she said to the priest  monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien  monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius  monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius  etc  etc  and thus i give it to you  father  and the school girls would begin to laugh  not in their sleeves  but under their veils  charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown on another occasion  the centenarian was telling stories  she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were every whit as good as the mousquetaires  it was a century which spoke through her  but it was the eighteenth century  she told about the custom of the four wines  which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne  when a great personage  a marshal of france  a prince  a duke  and a peer  traversed a town in burgundy or champagne  the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine  on the first goblet this inscription could be read  monkey wine  on the second  lion wine  on the third  sheep wine  on the fourth  hog wine  these four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard  the first  intoxication which enlivens  the second  that which irritates  the third  that which dulls  and the fourth  that which brutalizes in a cupboard  under lock and key  she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal  the rule of fontevrault did not forbid this she would not show this object to anyone  she shut herself up  which her rule allowed her to do  and hid herself  every time that she desired to contemplate it  if she heard a footstep in the corridor  she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands  as soon as it was mentioned to her  she became silent  she who was so fond of talking  the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy  thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent  what could that treasure of the centenarian be  which was so precious and so secret some holy book  no doubt  some unique chaplet  some authentic relic they lost themselves in conjectures  when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting  perhaps  and opened it  they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth  like some consecrated paten  it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary lads armed with enormous syringes the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical postures  one of the charming little loves is already fairly spitted  he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings  and still making an effort to fly  but the dancer is laughing with a satanical air  moral  love conquered by the colic  this platter  which is very curious  and which had  possibly the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea  was still in existence in september   it was for sale by a bric a brac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchais this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because said she  the parlor is too gloomy chapter x origin of the perpetual adoration however  this almost sepulchral parlor  of which we have sought to convey an idea  is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents  at the convent of the rue du temple in particular  which belonged  in truth  to another order  the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains  and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor  whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames  a portrait of a benedictine nun with unveiled face  painted bouquets  and even the head of a turk it is in that garden of the temple convent  that stood that famous chestnut tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in france  and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm as we have said  this convent of the temple was occupied by benedictines of the perpetual adoration  benedictines quite different from those who depended on citeaux  this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years  in  the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart  in two churches in paris  at saint sulpice and at saint jean en greve  a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar  m  the prior and vicar general of saint germain des pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy  in which the pope s nuncio officiated but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women  madame courtin marquise de boucs  and the comtesse de chateauvieux  this outrage committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar  though but temporary  would not depart from these holy souls  and it seemed to them that it could only be extenuated by a perpetual adoration  in some female monastery  both of them  one in  the other in  made donations of notable sums to mother catherine de bar  called of the holy sacrament  a benedictine nun  for the purpose of founding  to this pious end  a monastery of the order of saint benoit  the first permission for this foundation was given to mother catherine de bar by m  de metz  abbe of saint germain  on condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income  which amounts to six thousand livres  to the principal  after the abbe of saint germain  the king accorded letters patent  and all the rest  abbatial charter  and royal letters  was confirmed in  by the chamber of accounts and the parliament such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the benedictines of the perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris their first convent was a new building  in the rue cassette  out of the contributions of mesdames de boucs and de chateauvieux this order  as it will be seen  was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of citeaux  it mounted back to the abbe of saint germain des pres  in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred heart go back to the general of the jesuits  and the sisters of charity to the general of the lazarists it was also totally different from the bernardines of the petit picpus whose interior we have just shown  in  pope alexander vii  had authorized  by a special brief  the bernardines of the rue petit picpus to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine nuns of the holy sacrament  but the two orders remained distinct none the less chapter xi end of the petit picpus at the beginning of the restoration  the convent of the petit picpus was in its decay  this forms a part of the general death of the order which  after the eighteenth century  has been disappearing like all the religious orders  contemplation is  like prayer  one of humanity s needs  but  like everything which the revolution touched  it will be transformed  and from being hostile to social progress  it will become favorable to it the house of the petit picpus was becoming rapidly depopulated  in the little convent had disappeared  the school had disappeared  there were no longer any old women  nor young girls  the first were dead  the latter had taken their departure  volaverunt the rule of the perpetual adoration is so rigid in its nature that it alarms  vocations recoil before it  the order receives no recruits  in  it still obtained lay sisters here and there  but of professed nuns  none at all  forty years ago  the nuns numbered nearly a hundred fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty eight of them  how many are there to day  in  the prioress was young  a sign that the circle of choice was restricted  she was not forty years old  in proportion as the number diminishes  the fatigue increases  the service of each becomes more painful  the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule of saint benoit  the burden is implacable  and remains the same for the few as for the many  it weighs down  it crushes  thus they die  at the period when the author of this book still lived in paris two died  one was twenty five years old  the other twenty three  this latter can say  like julia alpinula  hic jaceo  vixi annos viginti et tres  it is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the education of girls we have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without entering it  and without introducing the minds which accompany us  and which are listening to our tale  to the profit of some  perchance  of the melancholy history of jean valjean  we have penetrated into this community  full of those old practices which seem so novel to day  it is the closed garden  hortus conclusus  we have spoken of this singular place in detail  but with respect  in so far  at least  as detail and respect are compatible  we do not understand all  but we insult nothing we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre  who wound up by anointing the executioner  and from the sneer of voltaire who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross an illogical act on voltaire s part  we may remark  by the way  for voltaire would have defended jesus as he defended calas  and even for those who deny superhuman incarnations  what does the crucifix represent  the assassinated sage in this nineteenth century  the religious idea is undergoing a crisis people are unlearning certain things  and they do well  provided that while unlearning them they learn this  there is no vacuum in the human heart  certain demolitions take place  and it is well that they do  but on condition that they are followed by reconstructions in the meantime  let us study things which are no more  it is necessary to know them  if only for the purpose of avoiding them  the counterfeits of the past assume false names  and gladly call themselves the future this spectre  this past  is given to falsifying its own passport  let us inform ourselves of the trap  let us be on our guard  the past has a visage  superstition  and a mask  hypocrisy  let us denounce the visage and let us tear off the mask as for convents  they present a complex problem a question of civilization  which condemns them  a question of liberty  which protects them book seventh parenthesis chapter i the convent as an abstract idea this book is a drama  whose leading personage is the infinite man is the second such being the case  and a convent having happened to be on our road  it has been our duty to enter it  why  because the convent  which is common to the orient as well as to the occident  to antiquity as well as to modern times  to paganism  to buddhism  to mahometanism  as well as to christianity  is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the infinite this is not the place for enlarging disproportionately on certain ideas  nevertheless  while absolutely maintaining our reserves  our restrictions  and even our indignations  we must say that every time we encounter man in the infinite  either well or ill understood  we feel ourselves overpowered with respect  there is  in the synagogue  in the mosque  in the pagoda  in the wigwam  a hideous side which we execrate and a sublime side  which we adore  what a contemplation for the mind and what endless food for thought  is the reverberation of god upon the human wall chapter ii the convent as an historical fact from the point of view of history  of reason  and of truth  monasticism is condemned  monasteries  when they abound in a nation  are clogs in its circulation  cumbrous establishments  centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist  monastic communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak  what the wart is to the human body  their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country  the monastic regime  good at the beginning of civilization  useful in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual  is bad when peoples have reached their manhood  moreover when it becomes relaxed  and when it enters into its period of disorder it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity  because it still continues to set the example claustration has had its day  cloisters  useful in the early education of modern civilization  have embarrassed its growth  and are injurious to its development  so far as institution and formation with relation to man are concerned  monasteries  which were good in the tenth century questionable in the fifteenth  are detestable in the nineteenth  the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations  italy and spain  the one the light  the other the splendor of europe for centuries  and  at the present day  these two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce  thanks to the healthy and vigorous hygiene of  alone the convent the ancient female convent in particular  such as it still presents itself on the threshold of this century  in italy  in austria in spain is one of the most sombre concretions of the middle ages  the cloister  that cloister  is the point of intersection of horrors  the catholic cloister  properly speaking  is wholly filled with the black radiance of death the spanish convent is the most funereal of all  there rise  in obscurity  beneath vaults filled with gloom  beneath domes vague with shadow  massive altars of babel  as high as cathedrals  there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark  there are extended  all nude on the ebony  great christs of ivory  more than bleeding bloody hideous and magnificent  with their elbows displaying the bones  their knee pans showing their integuments  their wounds showing their flesh crowned with silver thorns  nailed with nails of gold  with blood drops of rubies on their brows  and diamond tears in their eyes  the diamonds and rubies seem wet  and make veiled beings in the shadow below weep their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron tipped scourges their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles  their knees excoriated with prayer  women who think themselves wives  spectres who think themselves seraphim  do these women think  no  have they any will  no  do they love  no  do they live  no  their nerves have turned to bone  their bones have turned to stone  their veil is of woven night  their breath under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of death  the abbess  a spectre  sanctifies them and terrifies them the immaculate one is there  and very fierce  such are the ancient monasteries of spain  lairs of terrible devotion  caverns of virgins ferocious places catholic spain is more roman than rome herself  the spanish convent was above all others  the catholic convent  there was a flavor of the orient about it  the archbishop  the kislar aga of heaven  locked up and kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for god  the nun was the odalisque  the priest was the eunuch  the fervent were chosen in dreams and possessed christ  at night  the beautiful  nude young man descended from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one  lofty walls guarded the mystic sultana  who had the crucified for her sultan  from all living distraction  a glance on the outer world was infidelity  the in pace replaced the leather sack  that which was cast into the sea in the east was thrown into the ground in the west  in both quarters  women wrung their hands  the waves for the first  the grave for the last  here the drowned  there the buried  monstrous parallel to day the upholders of the past  unable to deny these things  have adopted the expedient of smiling at them  there has come into fashion a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history  of invalidating the commentaries of philosophy  of eliding all embarrassing facts and all gloomy questions  a matter for declamations  say the clever  declamations  repeat the foolish  jean jacques a declaimer diderot a declaimer  voltaire on calas  labarre  and sirven  declaimers i know not who has recently discovered that tacitus was a declaimer that nero was a victim  and that pity is decidedly due to that poor holofernes facts  however  are awkward things to disconcert  and they are obstinate  the author of this book has seen  with his own eyes  eight leagues distant from brussels there are relics of the middle ages there which are attainable for everybody at the abbey of villers  the hole of the oubliettes  in the middle of the field which was formerly the courtyard of the cloister  and on the banks of the thil  four stone dungeons  half under ground  half under the water  they were in pace each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron door  a vault  and a grated opening which  on the outside  is two feet above the level of the river  and on the inside  six feet above the level of the ground  four feet of river flow past along the outside wall  the ground is always soaked  the occupant of the in pace had this wet soil for his bed  in one of these dungeons  there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall  in another  there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite  too short for a person to lie down in  too low for him to stand upright in  a human being was put inside  with a coverlid of stone on top  this exists  it can be seen  it can be touched  these in pace these dungeons  these iron hinges  these necklets  that lofty peep hole on a level with the river s current  that box of stone closed with a lid of granite like a tomb  with this difference  that the dead man here was a living being  that soil which is but mud  that vault hole  those oozing walls what declaimers chapter iii on what conditions one can respect the past monasticism  such as it existed in spain  and such as it still exists in thibet  is a sort of phthisis for civilization  it stops life short  it simply depopulates  claustration  castration  it has been the scourge of europe  add to this the violence so often done to the conscience  the forced vocations  feudalism bolstered up by the cloister  the right of the first born pouring the excess of the family into monasticism  the ferocities of which we have just spoken  the in pace  the closed mouths the walled up brains  so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows  the taking of the habit  the interment of living souls add individual tortures to national degradations  and  whoever you may be  you will shudder before the frock and the veil those two winding sheets of human devising  nevertheless  at certain points and in certain places  in spite of philosophy  in spite of progress  the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century  and a singular ascetic recrudescence is  at this moment  astonishing the civilized world  the obstinacy of antiquated institutions in perpetuating themselves resembles the stubbornness of the rancid perfume which should claim our hair  the pretensions of the spoiled fish which should persist in being eaten  the persecution of the child s garment which should insist on clothing the man  the tenderness of corpses which should return to embrace the living ingrates  says the garment  i protected you in inclement weather  why will you have nothing to do with me  i have just come from the deep sea  says the fish  i have been a rose  says the perfume  i have loved you  says the corpse  i have civilized you  says the convent to this there is but one reply  in former days to dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things  and of the government of men by embalming  to restore dogmas in a bad condition to regild shrines  to patch up cloisters  to rebless reliquaries  to refurnish superstitions  to revictual fanaticisms  to put new handles on holy water brushes and militarism  to reconstitute monasticism and militarism  to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication of parasites  to force the past on the present this seems strange still  there are theorists who hold such theories  these theorists who are in other respects people of intelligence  have a very simple process  they apply to the past a glazing which they call social order  divine right  morality  family  the respect of elders  antique authority  sacred tradition  legitimacy  religion  and they go about shouting  look  take this  honest people  this logic was known to the ancients  the soothsayers practise it  they rubbed a black heifer over with chalk  and said  she is white  bos cretatus as for us  we respect the past here and there  and we spare it  above all  provided that it consents to be dead  if it insists on being alive we attack it  and we try to kill it superstitions  bigotries  affected devotion  prejudices  those forms all forms as they are  are tenacious of life  they have teeth and nails in their smoke  and they must be clasped close  body to body  and war must be made on them  and that without truce  for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms  it is difficult to seize darkness by the throat  and to hurl it to the earth a convent in france  in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century  is a college of owls facing the light  a cloister  caught in the very act of asceticism  in the very heart of the city of  and of  and of  rome blossoming out in paris  is an anachronism  in ordinary times  in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish one has only to make it spell out the date  but we are not in ordinary times let us fight let us fight  but let us make a distinction  the peculiar property of truth is never to commit excesses  what need has it of exaggeration there is that which it is necessary to destroy  and there is that which it is simply necessary to elucidate and examine  what a force is kindly and serious examination  let us not apply a flame where only a light is required so  given the nineteenth century  we are opposed  as a general proposition  and among all peoples  in asia as well as in europe in india as well as in turkey  to ascetic claustration  whoever says cloister  says marsh  their putrescence is evident  their stagnation is unhealthy  their fermentation infects people with fever  and etiolates them  their multiplication becomes a plague of egypt  we cannot think without affright of those lands where fakirs  bonzes  santons  greek monks  marabouts  talapoins  and dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin this said  the religious question remains  this question has certain mysterious  almost formidable sides  may we be permitted to look at it fixedly chapter iv the convent from the point of view of principles men unite themselves and dwell in communities  by virtue of what right by virtue of the right of association they shut themselves up at home  by virtue of what right  by virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door they do not come forth  by virtue of what right  by virtue of the right to go and come  which implies the right to remain at home there  at home  what do they do they speak in low tones  they drop their eyes  they toil  they renounce the world  towns  sensualities  pleasures  vanities  pride  interests they are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen  not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever  on entering there  each one who was rich makes himself poor  what he has  he gives to all  he who was what is called noble  a gentleman and a lord  is the equal of him who was a peasant  the cell is identical for all  all undergo the same tonsure  wear the same frock  eat the same black bread  sleep on the same straw  die on the same ashes  the same sack on their backs  the same rope around their loins  if the decision has been to go barefoot all go barefoot  there may be a prince among them  that prince is the same shadow as the rest  no titles  even family names have disappeared they bear only first names  all are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names  they have dissolved the carnal family  and constituted in their community a spiritual family  they have no other relatives than all men  they succor the poor  they care for the sick  they elect those whom they obey  they call each other my brother you stop me and exclaim  but that is the ideal convent it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent  that i should take notice of it thence it results that  in the preceding book  i have spoken of a convent with respectful accents  the middle ages cast aside  asia cast aside  the historical and political question held in reserve  from the purely philosophical point of view  outside the requirements of militant policy  on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties  i shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive  and  in some respects  a deferential gravity wherever there is a community  there is a commune  where there is a commune  there is right  the monastery is the product of the formula equality  fraternity  oh  how grand is liberty  and what a splendid transfiguration  liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic let us continue but these men  or these women who are behind these four walls  they dress themselves in coarse woollen  they are equals  they call each other brothers  that is well  but they do something else yes what they gaze on the darkness  they kneel  and they clasp their hands what does this signify chapter v prayer they pray to whom to god to pray to god what is the meaning of these words is there an infinite beyond us  is that infinite there  inherent permanent  necessarily substantial  since it is infinite  and because if it lacked matter it would be bounded  necessarily intelligent  since it is infinite  and because  if it lacked intelligence  it would end there  does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence  while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence  in other terms  is it not the absolute  of which we are only the relative at the same time that there is an infinite without us  is there not an infinite within us  are not these two infinites what an alarming plural  superposed  the one upon the other  is not this second infinite  so to speak  subjacent to the first  is it not the latter s mirror  reflection  echo  an abyss which is concentric with another abyss  is this second infinity intelligent also  does it think  does it love  does it will  if these two infinities are intelligent  each of them has a will principle  and there is an i  in the upper infinity as there is an i  in the lower infinity  the i  below is the soul  the i  on high is god to place the infinity here below in contact  by the medium of thought with the infinity on high  is called praying let us take nothing from the human mind  to suppress is bad  we must reform and transform  certain faculties in man are directed towards the unknown  thought  revery  prayer  the unknown is an ocean  what is conscience  it is the compass of the unknown  thought  revery prayer these are great and mysterious radiations  let us respect them whither go these majestic irradiations of the soul  into the shadow that is to say  to the light the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity  close to the right of the man  beside it  at the least  there exists the right of the soul to crush fanaticism and to venerate the infinite  such is the law  let us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of creation  and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars  we have a duty to labor over the human soul  to defend the mystery against the miracle  to adore the incomprehensible and reject the absurd to admit  as an inexplicable fact  only what is necessary  to purify belief  to remove superstitions from above religion  to clear god of caterpillars chapter vi the absolute goodness of prayer with regard to the modes of prayer  all are good  provided that they are sincere  turn your book upside down and be in the infinite there is  as we know  a philosophy which denies the infinite  there is also a philosophy  pathologically classified  which denies the sun  this philosophy is called blindness to erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth  is a fine blind man s self sufficiency the curious thing is the haughty  superior  and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which beholds god  one fancies he hears a mole crying  i pity them with their sun there are  as we know  powerful and illustrious atheists  at bottom  led back to the truth by their very force  they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists  it is with them only a question of definition  and in any case  if they do not believe in god  being great minds  they prove god we salute them as philosophers  while inexorably denouncing their philosophy let us go on the remarkable thing about it is  also  their facility in paying themselves off with words  a metaphysical school of the north impregnated to some extent with fog  has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the word will to say  the plant wills  instead of  the plant grows  this would be fecund in results  indeed  if we were to add  the universe wills  why because it would come to this  the plant wills  therefore it has an i the universe wills  therefore it has a god as for us  who  however  in contradistinction to this school  reject nothing a priori  a will in the plant  accepted by this school  appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it to deny the will of the infinite  that is to say  god  is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite  we have demonstrated this the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism  everything becomes a mental conception with nihilism  no discussion is possible  for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor  and is not quite sure that it exists itself from its point of view  it is possible that it may be for itself  only a mental conception only  it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump  simply by the utterance of the word  mind in short  no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the monosyllable  no to no there is only one reply  yes nihilism has no point there is no such thing as nothingness  zero does not exist  everything is something  nothing is nothing man lives by affirmation even more than by bread even to see and to show does not suffice  philosophy should be an energy  it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man  socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius  in other words  the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity  eden should be changed into a lyceum  science should be a cordial  to enjoy what a sad aim  and what a paltry ambition  the brute enjoys  to offer thought to the thirst of men  to give them all as an elixir the notion of god  to make conscience and science fraternize in them  to render them just by this mysterious confrontation  such is the function of real philosophy  morality is a blossoming out of truths contemplation leads to action  the absolute should be practicable  it is necessary that the ideal should be breathable  drinkable  and eatable to the human mind  it is the ideal which has the right to say  take  this it is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying  and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease  without any other result than that of being convenient to curiosity for our part  adjourning the development of our thought to another occasion  we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand man as a point of departure nor progress as an end  without those two forces which are their two motors  faith and love progress is the goal  the ideal is the type what is this ideal  it is god ideal  absolute  perfection  infinity  identical words chapter vii precautions to be observed in blame history and philosophy have eternal duties  which are  at the same time simple duties  to combat caiphas the high priest  draco the lawgiver trimalcion the legislator  tiberius the emperor  this is clear  direct and limpid  and offers no obscurity but the right to live apart  even with its inconveniences and its abuses  insists on being stated and taken into account  cenobitism is a human problem when one speaks of convents  those abodes of error  but of innocence of aberration but of good will  of ignorance but of devotion  of torture but of martyrdom  it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no a convent is a contradiction  its object  salvation  its means thereto sacrifice  the convent is supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation to abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism in the cloister  one suffers in order to enjoy  one draws a bill of exchange on death  one discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light in the cloister  hell is accepted in advance as a post obit on paradise the taking of the veil or the frock is a suicide paid for with eternity it does not seem to us  that on such a subject mockery is permissible all about it is serious  the good as well as the bad the just man frowns  but never smiles with a malicious sneer  we understand wrath  but not malice chapter viii faith  law a few words more we blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues  we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal  but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man we salute the man who kneels a faith  this is a necessity for man  woe to him who believes nothing one is not unoccupied because one is absorbed  there is visible labor and invisible labor to contemplate is to labor  to think is to act folded arms toil  clasped hands work  a gaze fixed on heaven is a work thales remained motionless for four years  he founded philosophy in our opinion  cenobites are not lazy men  and recluses are not idlers to meditate on the shadow is a serious thing without invalidating anything that we have just said  we believe that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living  on this point the priest and the philosopher agree  we must die  the abbe de la trappe replies to horace to mingle with one s life a certain presence of the sepulchre this is the law of the sage  and it is the law of the ascetic  in this respect the ascetic and the sage converge  there is a material growth  we admit it  there is a moral grandeur  we hold to that  thoughtless and vivacious spirits say what is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery what purpose do they serve  what do they do alas  in the presence of the darkness which environs us  and which awaits us  in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of us  we reply  there is probably no work more divine than that performed by these souls  and we add  there is probably no work which is more useful there certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never pray at all in our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is mingled with prayer leibnitz praying is grand  voltaire adoring is fine  deo erexit voltaire we are for religion as against religions we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of orisons  and the sublimity of prayer moreover  at this minute which we are now traversing a minute which will not  fortunately  leave its impress on the nineteenth century at this hour  when so many men have low brows and souls but little elevated  among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment and who are busied with the brief and misshapen things of matter whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us the monastery is a renunciation  sacrifice wrongly directed is still sacrifice  to mistake a grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its own taken by itself  and ideally  and in order to examine the truth on all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted  the monastery the female convent in particular for in our century it is woman who suffers the most  and in this exile of the cloister there is something of protestation the female convent has incontestably a certain majesty this cloistered existence which is so austere  so depressing  a few of whose features we have just traced  is not life  for it is not liberty it is not the tomb  for it is not plenitude  it is the strange place whence one beholds  as from the crest of a lofty mountain  on one side the abyss where we are  on the other  the abyss whither we shall go  it is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds  illuminated and obscured by both at the same time  where the ray of life which has become enfeebled is mingled with the vague ray of death  it is the half obscurity of the tomb we  who do not believe what these women believe  but who  like them live by faith we have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror  without a sort of pity  that is full of envy  of those devoted  trembling and trusting creatures  of these humble and august souls  who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery  waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not yet open  turned towards the light which one cannot see  possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is  aspiring towards the gulf  and the unknown  their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness  kneeling  bewildered  stupefied  shuddering  half lifted  at times  by the deep breaths of eternity book eighth cemeteries take that which is committed them chapter i which treats of the manner of entering a convent it was into this house that jean valjean had  as fauchelevent expressed it  fallen from the sky he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polonceau  that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night  was the nuns chanting matins  that hall  of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom  was the chapel  that phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation that bell  the sound of which had so strangely surprised him  was the gardener s bell attached to the knee of father fauchelevent cosette once put to bed  jean valjean and fauchelevent had  as we have already seen  supped on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good  crackling fire  then  the only bed in the hut being occupied by cosette  each threw himself on a truss of straw before he shut his eyes  jean valjean said  i must remain here henceforth  this remark trotted through fauchelevent s head all night long to tell the truth  neither of them slept jean valjean  feeling that he was discovered and that javert was on his scent  understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to paris  then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister  jean valjean had  henceforth  but one thought to remain there  now  for an unfortunate man in his position  this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places  the most dangerous  because  as no men might enter there  if he were discovered it was a flagrant offence  and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison  the safest  because  if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there  who would ever seek him in such a place  to dwell in an impossible place was safety on his side  fauchelevent was cudgelling his brains  he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter  how had m  madeleine got there  when the walls were what they were  cloister walls are not to be stepped over  how did he get there with a child  one cannot scale a perpendicular wall with a child in one s arms  who was that child  where did they both come from  since fauchelevent had lived in the convent  he had heard nothing of m  sur m  and he knew nothing of what had taken place there  father madeleine had an air which discouraged questions  and besides  fauchelevent said to himself  one does not question a saint  m  madeleine had preserved all his prestige in fauchelevent s eyes  only  from some words which jean valjean had let fall  the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m  madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times  and that he was pursued by his creditors  or that he had compromised himself in some political affair  and was in hiding  which last did not displease fauchelevent  who  like many of our peasants of the north  had an old fund of bonapartism about him  while in hiding  m  madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge  and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there  but the inexplicable point  to which fauchelevent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain  was that m madeleine should be there  and that he should have that little girl with him  fauchelevent saw them  touched them  spoke to them  and still did not believe it possible  the incomprehensible had just made its entrance into fauchelevent s hut  fauchelevent groped about amid conjectures  and could see nothing clearly but this  m  madeleine saved my life this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course  he said to himself  it is my turn now  he added in his conscience  m  madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out  he made up his mind to save m  madeleine nevertheless  he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies  after what he did for me  would i save him if he were a thief just the same  if he were an assassin  would i save him  just the same since he is a saint  shall i save him  just the same but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent fauchelevent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking  this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his self devotion  his good will  and a little of that old rustic cunning  on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise  undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister  and the steep escarpments of the rule of saint benoit  father fauchelevent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life  and who  towards the end of his days  halt  infirm  with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful  and perceiving a generous action to be performed  flung himself upon it like a man  who at the moment when he is dying  should find close to his hand a glass of good wine which he had never tasted  and should swallow it with avidity  we may add that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him  and had ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him so he took his resolve  to devote himself to m  madeleine we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy  that description is just  but incomplete  at the point of this story which we have now reached  a little of father fauchelevent s physiology becomes useful he was a peasant  but he had been a notary  which added trickery to his cunning  and penetration to his ingenuousness  having  through various causes  failed in his business  he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer  but  in spite of oaths and lashings  which horses seem to require  something of the notary had lingered in him  he had some natural wit  he talked good grammar  he conversed  which is a rare thing in a village  and the other peasants said of him  he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat  fauchelevent belonged  in fact  to that species  which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi bourgeois  demi lout  and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon hole of the plebeian  rather rustic  rather citified  pepper and salt  fauchelevent  though sorely tried and harshly used by fate worn out  a sort of poor  threadbare old soul  was  nevertheless  an impulsive man  and extremely spontaneous in his actions  a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked  his defects and his vices  for he had some  were all superficial  in short  his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer  his aged face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead  which signify malice or stupidity at daybreak  father fauchelevent opened his eyes  after having done an enormous deal of thinking  and beheld m  madeleine seated on his truss of straw  and watching cosette s slumbers  fauchelevent sat up and said now that you are here  how are you going to contrive to enter this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his revery the two men took counsel together in the first place  said fauchelevent  you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber  either you or the child  one step in the garden and we are done for that is true monsieur madeleine  resumed fauchelevent  you have arrived at a very auspicious moment  i mean to say a very inauspicious moment  one of the ladies is very ill  this will prevent them from looking much in our direction  it seems that she is dying  the prayers of the forty hours are being said  the whole community is in confusion  that occupies them the one who is on the point of departure is a saint  in fact  we are all saints here  all the difference between them and me is that they say our cell  and that i say my cabin  the prayers for the dying are to be said  and then the prayers for the dead  we shall be at peace here for to day  but i will not answer for to morrow still  observed jean valjean  this cottage is in the niche of the wall  it is hidden by a sort of ruin  there are trees  it is not visible from the convent and i add that the nuns never come near it well  said jean valjean the interrogation mark which accentuated this well  signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here  it was to this interrogation point that fauchelevent responded there are the little girls what little girls  asked jean valjean just as fauchelevent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered  a bell emitted one stroke the nun is dead  said he  there is the knell and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen the bell struck a second time it is the knell  monsieur madeleine  the bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty four hours  until the body is taken from the church you see  they play  at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball roll aside  to send them all hither  in spite of prohibitions  to hunt and rummage for it all about here  those cherubs are devils who  asked jean valjean the little girls  you would be very quickly discovered  they would shriek  oh  a man  there is no danger to day  there will be no recreation hour  the day will be entirely devoted to prayers  you hear the bell  as i told you  a stroke each minute  it is the death knell i understand  father fauchelevent  there are pupils and jean valjean thought to himself here is cosette s education already provided fauchelevent exclaimed pardine  there are little girls indeed  and they would bawl around you and they would rush off  to be a man here is to have the plague  you see how they fasten a bell to my paw as though i were a wild beast jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought this convent would be our salvation  he murmured then he raised his voice yes  the difficulty is to remain here no  said fauchelevent  the difficulty is to get out jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart to get out yes  monsieur madeleine  in order to return here it is first necessary to get out and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fauchelevent went on you must not be found here in this fashion  whence come you  for me you fall from heaven  because i know you  but the nuns require one to enter by the door all at once they heard a rather complicated pealing from another bell ah  said fauchelevent  they are ringing up the vocal mothers  they are going to the chapter  they always hold a chapter when any one dies she died at daybreak  people generally do die at daybreak  but cannot you get out by the way in which you entered  come  i do not ask for the sake of questioning you  but how did you get in jean valjean turned pale  the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder  you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers  and once out of it  imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither  jean valjean pictured to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter  agents on the watch  sentinels everywhere  frightful fists extended towards his collar  javert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps impossible  said he  father fauchelevent  say that i fell from the sky but i believe it  i believe it  retorted fauchelevent  you have no need to tell me that  the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to  and then dropped you  only  he meant to place you in a man s convent  he made a mistake come  there goes another peal  that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view a corpse  all that is the ceremony of dying  these good ladies are not at all fond of that visit  a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything  he lifts the veil  sometimes he lifts something else too  how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time  what is the matter your little one is still asleep  what is her name cosette she is your daughter  you are her grandfather  that is yes it will be easy enough for her to get out of here  i have my service door which opens on the courtyard  i knock  the porter opens  i have my vintage basket on my back  the child is in it  i go out  father fauchelevent goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural  you will tell the child to keep very quiet  she will be under the cover  i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friend  a fruit seller whom i know in the rue chemin vert  who is deaf  and who has a little bed  i will shout in the fruit seller s ear  that she is a niece of mine  and that she is to keep her for me until to morrow  then the little one will re enter with you  for i will contrive to have you re enter  it must be done  but how will you manage to get out jean valjean shook his head no one must see me  the whole point lies there  father fauchelevent find some means of getting me out in a basket  under cover  like cosette fauchelevent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand  a sign of serious embarrassment a third peal created a diversion that is the dead doctor taking his departure  said fauchelevent  he has taken a look and said  she is dead  that is well  when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise  the undertaker s company sends a coffin  if it is a mother  the mothers lay her out  if she is a sister the sisters lay her out  after which  i nail her up  that forms a part of my gardener s duty  a gardener is a bit of a grave digger  she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead  i don t count the undertaker s men and myself as men  it is in that hall that i nail up the coffin  the undertaker s men come and get it  and whip up  coachman  that s the way one goes to heaven  they fetch a box with nothing in it  they take it away again with something in it  that s what a burial is like  de profundis a horizontal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette  who lay with her mouth vaguely open  and had the air of an angel drinking in the light  jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her he was no longer listening to fauchelevent that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence  the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery  they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery  it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations  which has no uniform  and which is going to retire  it is a shame  for it is convenient  i have a friend there  father mestienne  the grave digger  the nuns here possess one privilege  it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall  there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf  but how many events have happened since yesterday  mother crucifixion is dead  and father madeleine is buried  said jean valjean  smiling sadly fauchelevent caught the word goodness  if you were here for good  it would be a real burial a fourth peal burst out  fauchelevent hastily detached the belled knee cap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again this time it is for me  the mother prioress wants me  good  now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle  monsieur madeleine  don t stir from here  and wait for me  something new has come up  if you are hungry  there is wine  bread and cheese and he hastened out of the hut  crying  coming  coming jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit  casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch less than ten minutes later  father fauchelevent  whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight  tapped gently at a door  and a gentle voice replied  forever  forever  that is to say  enter the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business  this parlor adjoined the chapter hall  the prioress  seated on the only chair in the parlor  was waiting for fauchelevent chapter ii fauchelevent in the presence of a difficulty it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns  to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions  at the moment when fauchelevent entered  this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress  who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de blemeur  mother innocente  who was ordinarily cheerful the gardener made a timid bow  and remained at the door of the cell  the prioress  who was telling her beads  raised her eyes and said ah  it is you  father fauvent this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent fauchelevent bowed again father fauvent  i have sent for you here i am  reverend mother i have something to say to you and so have i  said fauchelevent with a boldness which caused him inward terror  i have something to say to the very reverend mother the prioress stared at him ah  you have a communication to make to me a request very well  speak goodman fauchelevent  the ex notary  belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance  a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force  you do not distrust it  and you are caught by it  fauchelevent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent  always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity  as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro  he saw before him only an agitation of shadows  by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh  and those corpses were alive for him  he was like a deaf man whose sight grows keener  and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute  he had applied himself to riddling out the significance of the different peals and he had succeeded  so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him  the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear  fauchelevent knew all and concealed all  that constituted his art the whole convent thought him stupid  a great merit in religion  the vocal mothers made much of fauchelevent  he was a curious mute  he inspired confidence  moreover  he was regular  and never went out except for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit  none the less  he had set two men to chattering  the porter  in the convent  and he knew the singularities of their parlor  and the grave digger  at the cemetery  and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture  in this way  he possessed a double light on the subject of these nuns  one as to their life  the other as to their death  but he did not abuse his knowledge  the congregation thought a great deal of him  old  lame  blind to everything  probably a little deaf into the bargain what qualities  they would have found it difficult to replace him the goodman  with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated  entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress  he talked a long time about his age  his infirmities  the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work  of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed  like the last  for instance  when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds  because of the moon and he wound up as follows  that he had a brother the prioress made a movement a brother no longer young a second movement on the part of the prioress  but one expressive of reassurance that  if he might be permitted  this brother would come and live with him and help him  that he was an excellent gardener  that the community would receive from him good service  better than his own  that  otherwise  if his brother were not admitted  as he  the elder  felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work  he should be obliged greatly to his regret  to go away  and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him  who might be reared for god in the house  and who might  who knows  become a nun some day when he had finished speaking  the prioress stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers  and said to him could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening for what purpose to serve as a lever yes  reverend mother  replied fauchelevent the prioress  without adding a word  rose and entered the adjoining room  which was the hall of the chapter  and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled  fauchelevent was left alone chapter iii mother innocente about a quarter of an hour elapsed  the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied  we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued  to the best of our ability father fauvent reverend mother do you know the chapel i have a little cage there  where i hear the mass and the offices and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times there is a stone to be raised heavy the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar the slab which closes the vault yes it would be a good thing to have two men for it mother ascension  who is as strong as a man  will help you a woman is never a man we have only a woman here to help you  each one does what he can because dom mabillon gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard  while merlonus horstius only gives three hundred and sixty seven  i do not despise merlonus horstius neither do i merit consists in working according to one s strength  a cloister is not a dock yard and a woman is not a man  but my brother is the strong one  though and can you get a lever that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door there is a ring in the stone i will put the lever through it and the stone is so arranged that it swings on a pivot that is good  reverend mother  i will open the vault and the four mother precentors will help you and when the vault is open it must be closed again will that be all no give me your orders  very reverend mother fauvent  we have confidence in you i am here to do anything you wish and to hold your peace about everything yes  reverend mother when the vault is open i will close it again but before that what  reverend mother something must be lowered into it a silence ensued  the prioress  after a pout of the under lip which resembled hesitation  broke it father fauvent reverend mother you know that a mother died this morning no did you not hear the bell nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really i can hardly distinguish my own signal she died at daybreak and then  the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning it was mother crucifixion  a blessed woman the prioress paused  moved her lips  as though in mental prayer  and resumed three years ago  madame de bethune  a jansenist  turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer ah  yes  now i hear the knell  reverend mother the mothers have taken her to the dead room  which opens on the church i know no other man than you can or must enter that chamber  see to that  a fine sight it would be  to see a man enter the dead room more often hey more often what do you say i say more often more often than what reverend mother  i did not say more often than what  i said more often i don t understand you  why do you say more often in order to speak like you  reverend mother but i did not say more often at that moment  nine o clock struck at nine o clock in the morning and at all hours  praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar  said the prioress amen  said fauchelevent the clock struck opportunely  it cut more often  short  it is probable that had it not been for this  the prioress and fauchelevent would never have unravelled that skein fauchelevent mopped his forehead the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur  probably sacred then raised her voice in her lifetime  mother crucifixion made converts  after her death  she will perform miracles she will  replied father fauchelevent  falling into step  and striving not to flinch again father fauvent  the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion no doubt  it is not granted to every one to die  like cardinal de berulle  while saying the holy mass  and to breathe forth their souls to god  while pronouncing these words  hanc igitur oblationem  but without attaining to such happiness  mother crucifixion s death was very precious  she retained her consciousness to the very last moment she spoke to us  then she spoke to the angels  she gave us her last commands  if you had a little more faith  and if you could have been in her cell  she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled  we felt that she was regaining her life in god  there was something of paradise in that death fauchelevent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing amen  said he father fauvent  what the dead wish must be done the prioress took off several beads of her chaplet  fauchelevent held his peace she went on i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord  who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life  and who bear wonderful fruit reverend mother  you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden besides  she is more than a dead woman  she is a saint like yourself  reverend mother she slept in her coffin for twenty years  by express permission of our holy father  pius vii the one who crowned the emp buonaparte for a clever man like fauchelevent  this allusion was an awkward one fortunately  the prioress  completely absorbed in her own thoughts  did not hear it  she continued father fauvent reverend mother saint didorus  archbishop of cappadocia  desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb  acarus  which signifies  a worm of the earth  this was done  is this true yes  reverend mother the blessed mezzocane  abbot of aquila  wished to be buried beneath the gallows  this was done that is true saint terentius  bishop of port  where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea  requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parricides  in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb  this was done  the dead must be obeyed so be it the body of bernard guidonis  born in france near roche abeille  was as he had ordered  and in spite of the king of castile  borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges  although bernard guidonis was bishop of tuy in spain  can the contrary be affirmed for that matter  no  reverend mother the fact is attested by plantavit de la fosse several beads of the chaplet were told off  still in silence  the prioress resumed father fauvent  mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just it is a continuation of her slumber so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes and we are to reject the undertaker s coffin precisely i am at the orders of the very reverend community the four mother precentors will assist you in nailing up the coffin  i do not need them no  in lowering the coffin where into the vault what vault under the altar fauchelevent started the vault under the altar under the altar but you will have an iron bar yes  but you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but the dead must be obeyed  to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel  not to go to profane earth  to remain there in death where she prayed while living  such was the last wish of mother crucifixion she asked it of us  that is to say  commanded us but it is forbidden forbidden by men  enjoined by god what if it became known we have confidence in you oh  i am a stone in your walls the chapter assembled  the vocal mothers  whom i have just consulted again  and who are now deliberating  have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried  according to her wish  in her own coffin under our altar  think  father fauvent  if she were to work miracles here  what a glory of god for the community  and miracles issue from tombs but  reverend mother  if the agent of the sanitary commission saint benoit ii  in the matter of sepulture  resisted constantine pogonatus but the commissary of police chonodemaire  one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius  expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion  that is to say  beneath the altar but the inspector from the prefecture the world is nothing in the presence of the cross  martin  the eleventh general of the carthusians  gave to his order this device  stat crux dum volvitur orbis amen  said fauchelevent  who imperturbably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma  whenever he heard latin any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long  on the day when the rhetorician gymnastoras left his prison  bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in  he halted in front of the first tree which he came to  harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it  the prioress  who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence  and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of a dam which has broken away i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard  who was bernard  the first abbot of clairvaux  fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth  his father was named tecelin  and his mother alethe  he began at citeaux  to end in clairvaux  he was ordained abbot by the bishop of chalon sur saone  guillaume de champeaux  he had seven hundred novices  and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries  he overthrew abeilard at the council of sens in  and pierre de bruys and henry his disciple  and another sort of erring spirits who were called the apostolics  he confounded arnauld de brescia  darted lightning at the monk raoul  the murderer of the jews  dominated the council of reims in  caused the condemnation of gilbert de porea bishop of poitiers  caused the condemnation of eon de l etoile  arranged the disputes of princes  enlightened king louis the young  advised pope eugene iii  regulated the temple  preached the crusade  performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime  and as many as thirty nine in one day  who was benoit  he was the patriarch of mont cassin  he was the second founder of the saintete claustrale he was the basil of the west  his order has produced forty popes  two hundred cardinals  fifty patriarchs  sixteen hundred archbishops  four thousand six hundred bishops  four emperors  twelve empresses  forty six kings  forty one queens  three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years  on one side saint bernard  on the other the agent of the sanitary department  on one side saint benoit  on the other the inspector of public ways  the state the road commissioners  the public undertaker  regulations  the administration  what do we know of all that  there is not a chance passer by who would not be indignant to see how we are treated  we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ  your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention  god subordinated to the commissary of police  such is the age  silence  fauvent fauchelevent was but ill at ease under this shower bath  the prioress continued no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture  only fanatics and those in error deny it  we live in times of terrible confusion  we do not know that which it is necessary to know  and we know that which we should ignore  we are ignorant and impious  in this age there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics  a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century  others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi  to the cross of jesus christ  louis xvi  was merely a king  let us beware of god  there is no longer just nor unjust  the name of voltaire is known  but not the name of cesar de bus  nevertheless  cesar de bus is a man of blessed memory  and voltaire one of unblessed memory  the last arch bishop the cardinal de perigord  did not even know that charles de gondren succeeded to berulle  and francois bourgoin to gondren and jean francois senault to bourgoin  and father sainte marthe to jean francois senault  the name of father coton is known  not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the oratorie  but because he furnished henri iv  the huguenot king  with the material for an oath  that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales  is that he cheated at play  and then  religion is attacked  why because there have been bad priests  because sagittaire  bishop of gap was the brother of salone  bishop of embrun  and because both of them followed mommol  what has that to do with the question  does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint  and giving half of his cloak to a beggar  they persecute the saints  they shut their eyes to the truth  darkness is the rule  the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind  no one thinks of hell as a reality  oh  how wicked people are  by order of the king signifies to day  by order of the revolution one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead  a holy death is prohibited  burial is a civil matter  this is horrible  saint leo ii  wrote two special letters  one to pierre notaire  the other to the king of the visigoths  for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead  the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the emperor  gauthier  bishop of chalons  held his own in this matter against otho  duke of burgundy  the ancient magistracy agreed with him  in former times we had voices in the chapter  even on matters of the day  the abbot of citeaux  the general of the order  was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy  we do what we please with our dead  is not the body of saint benoit himself in france  in the abbey of fleury  called saint benoit sur loire  although he died in italy at mont cassin  on saturday  the st of the month of march  of the year  all this is incontestable  i abhor psalm singers  i hate priors  i execrate heretics  but i should detest yet more any one who should maintain the contrary  one has only to read arnoul wion  gabriel bucelin  trithemus  maurolics  and dom luc d achery the prioress took breath  then turned to fauchelevent is it settled  father fauvent it is settled  reverend mother we may depend on you i will obey that is well i am entirely devoted to the convent that is understood  you will close the coffin  the sisters will carry it to the chapel  the office for the dead will then be said  then we shall return to the cloister  between eleven o clock and midnight  you will come with your iron bar  all will be done in the most profound secrecy  there will be in the chapel only the four mother precentors mother ascension and yourself and the sister at the post she will not turn round but she will hear she will not listen  besides  what the cloister knows the world learns not a pause ensued  the prioress went on you will remove your bell  it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence reverend mother what  father fauvent has the doctor for the dead paid his visit he will pay it at four o clock to day  the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung  but you do not understand any of the peals i pay no attention to any but my own that is well  father fauvent reverend mother  a lever at least six feet long will be required where will you obtain it where gratings are not lacking  iron bars are not lacking  i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden about three quarters of an hour before midnight  do not forget reverend mother what if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort  my brother is the strong man for you  a perfect turk you will do it as speedily as possible i cannot work very fast  i am infirm  that is why i require an assistant  i limp to limp is no sin  and perhaps it is a blessing  the emperor henry ii who combated antipope gregory and re established benoit viii  has two surnames  the saint and the lame two surtouts are a good thing  murmured fauchelevent  who really was a little hard of hearing now that i think of it  father fauvent  let us give a whole hour to it that is not too much  be near the principal altar  with your iron bar at eleven o clock  the office begins at midnight  everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community  these are my orders  i am to nail up the coffin  at eleven o clock exactly  i am to be in the chapel  the mother precentors will be there  mother ascension will be there  two men would be better  however  never mind  i shall have my lever  we will open the vault  we will lower the coffin  and we will close the vault again  after which  there will be no trace of anything  the government will have no suspicion  thus all has been arranged  reverend mother no what else remains the empty coffin remains this produced a pause  fauchelevent meditated  the prioress meditated what is to be done with that coffin  father fauvent it will be given to the earth empty another silence  fauchelevent made  with his left hand  that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject reverend mother  i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church  and no one can enter there but myself  and i will cover the coffin with the pall yes  but the bearers  when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave  will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it ah  the de  exclaimed fauchelevent the prioress began to make the sign of the cross  and looked fixedly at the gardener  the vil stuck fast in his throat he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath i will put earth in the coffin  reverend mother  that will produce the effect of a corpse you are right  earth  that is the same thing as man  so you will manage the empty coffin i will make that my special business the prioress s face  up to that moment troubled and clouded  grew serene once more  she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him  fauchelevent went towards the door  as he was on the point of passing out  the prioress raised her voice gently i am pleased with you  father fauvent  bring your brother to me to morrow  after the burial  and tell him to fetch his daughter chapter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castillejo the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly  moreover  fauchelevent was in a dilemma  he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden  cosette had waked up  jean valjean had placed her near the fire  at the moment when fauchelevent entered  jean valjean was pointing out to her the vintner s basket on the wall  and saying to her listen attentively to me  my little cosette  we must go away from this house  but we shall return to it  and we shall be very happy here  the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that you will wait for me at a lady s house  i shall come to fetch you  obey and say nothing  above all things  unless you want madame thenardier to get you again cosette nodded gravely jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fauchelevent opening the door well everything is arranged  and nothing is  said fauchelevent  i have permission to bring you in  but before bringing you in you must be got out  that s where the difficulty lies  it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out and she will hold her tongue i answer for that but you  father madeleine and  after a silence  fraught with anxiety  fauchelevent exclaimed why  get out as you came in jean valjean  as in the first instance  contented himself with saying impossible fauchelevent grumbled  more to himself than to jean valjean there is another thing which bothers me  i have said that i would put earth in it  when i come to think it over  the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing  it won t do  it will get displaced  it will move about  the men will bear it  you understand father madeleine  the government will notice it jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving fauchelevent went on how the de uce are you going to get out  it must all be done by to morrow morning  it is to morrow that i am to bring you in  the prioress expects you then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he  fauchelevent  was to render to the community  that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials  that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave digger at the cemetery  that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed  and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel  that the police regulations forbade this  but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused  that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased  that it was so much the worse for the government  that he  fauchelevent  was to nail up the coffin in the cell  raise the stone in the chapel  and lower the corpse into the vault  and that  by way of thanks  the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener  and his niece as a pupil that his brother was m  madeleine  and that his niece was cosette  that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery  but that he could not bring m  madeleine in from the outside if m  madeleine was not outside that that was the first problem  and then  that there was another  the empty coffin what is that empty coffin  asked jean valjean fauchelevent replied the coffin of the administration what coffin  what administration a nun dies  the municipal doctor comes and says  a nun has died the government sends a coffin  the next day it sends a hearse and undertaker s men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery  the undertaker s men will come and lift the coffin  there will be nothing in it put something in it a corpse  i have none no what then a living person what person me  said jean valjean fauchelevent  who was seated  sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you why not jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter you know  fauchelevent  what you have said  mother crucifixion is dead  and i add  and father madeleine is buried ah  good  you can laugh  you are not speaking seriously very seriously  i must get out of this place certainly l have told you to find a basket  and a cover for me also well the basket will be of pine  and the cover a black cloth in the first place  it will be a white cloth  nuns are buried in white let it be a white cloth  then you are not like other men  father madeleine to behold such devices  which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys  spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him  and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent  caused fauchelevent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the rue saint denis would inspire in a passer by jean valjean went on the problem is to get out of here without being seen  this offers the means  but give me some information  in the first place  how is it managed  where is this coffin the empty one yes down stairs  in what is called the dead room  it stands on two trestles  under the pall how long is the coffin six feet what is this dead room it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden  which is closed on the outside by a shutter  and two doors  one leads into the convent  the other into the church what church the church in the street  the church which any one can enter have you the keys to those two doors no  i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent  the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church when does the porter open that door only to allow the undertaker s men to enter  when they come to get the coffin  when the coffin has been taken out  the door is closed again who nails up the coffin i do who spreads the pall over it i do are you alone not another man  except the police doctor  can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall could you hide me in that room to night when every one is asleep no  but i could hide you in a small  dark nook which opens on the dead room  where i keep my tools to use for burials  and of which i have the key at what time will the hearse come for the coffin to morrow about three o clock in the afternoon  the burial will take place at the vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall  it is not very near i will remain concealed in your tool closet all night and all the morning  and how about food  i shall be hungry i will bring you something you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o clock fauchelevent recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible bah  impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank what seemed unprecedented to fauchelevent was  we repeat  a simple matter to jean valjean  jean valjean had been in worse straits than this  any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape  the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him an escape is a cure  what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure  to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods  to live for a long time in a box  to find air where there is none  to economize his breath for hours  to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean s gloomy talents moreover  a coffin containing a living being that convict s expedient is also an imperial expedient  if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo  this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plombes for the last time after his abdication he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of saint yuste in this manner fauchelevent  who had recovered himself a little  exclaimed but how will you manage to breathe i will breathe in that box  the mere thought of it suffocates me you surely must have a gimlet  you will make a few holes here and there  around my mouth  and you will nail the top plank on loosely good  and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze and jean valjean added father fauchelevent  we must come to a decision  i must either be caught here  or accept this escape through the hearse every one has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door  who is there who has not said to a cat  do come in  there are men who  when an incident stands half open before them  have the same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions  at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate  the over prudent  cats as they are  and because they are cats  sometimes incur more danger than the audacious  fauchelevent was of this hesitating nature  but jean valjean s coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself  he grumbled well  since there is no other means jean valjean resumed the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery that is the very point that is not troublesome  exclaimed fauchelevent  if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right  i am sure of getting you out of the grave  the grave digger is a drunkard and a friend of mine  he is father mestienne  an old fellow of the old school  the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave  and i put the grave digger in my pocket  i will tell you what will take place  they will arrive a little before dusk  three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed  the hearse will drive directly up to the grave  i shall follow  that is my business  i shall have a hammer a chisel  and some pincers in my pocket  the hearse halts  the undertaker s men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you down  the priest says the prayers  makes the sign of the cross  sprinkles the holy water  and takes his departure  i am left alone with father mestienne he is my friend  i tell you  one of two things will happen  he will either be sober  or he will not be sober  if he is not drunk  i shall say to him  come and drink a bout while the bon coing the good quince is open  i carry him off  i get him drunk it does not take long to make father mestienne drunk  he always has the beginning of it about him i lay him under the table  i take his card  so that i can get into the cemetery again  and i return without him  then you have no longer any one but me to deal with  if he is drunk  i shall say to him  be off  i will do your work for you  off he goes  and i drag you out of the hole jean valjean held out his hand  and fauchelevent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant that is settled  father fauchelevent  all will go well provided nothing goes wrong  thought fauchelevent  in that case  it would be terrible chapter v it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal on the following day  as the sun was declining  the very rare passers by on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse  ornamented with skulls  cross bones  and tears  this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross  like a huge corpse with drooping arms  a mourning coach  in which could be seen a priest in his surplice  and a choir boy in his red cap  followed  two undertaker s men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse  behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer  who limped along  the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery the handle of a hammer  the blade of a cold chisel  and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible  protruding from the man s pocket the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris  it had its peculiar usages  just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door  which old people in the quarter  who clung tenaciously to ancient words  still called the porte cavaliere and the porte pietonne  the bernardines benedictines of the rue petit picpus had obtained permission  as we have already stated  to be buried there in a corner apart  and at night  the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community  the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter  in this cemetery  they were subjected to a special discipline  the gates of the paris cemeteries closed  at that epoch  at sundown  and this being a municipal regulation  the vaugirard cemetery was bound by it like the rest  the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates  adjoining a pavilion built by the architect perronet  and inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery  these gates  therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides  if any grave digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery  there was but one way for him to get out his grave digger s card furnished by the department of public funerals  a sort of letter box was constructed in the porter s window the grave digger dropped his card into this box  the porter heard it fall  pulled the rope  and the small door opened  if the man had not his card  he mentioned his name  the porter  who was sometimes in bed and asleep  rose  came out and identified the man  and opened the gate with his key  the grave digger stepped out  but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs this cemetery  with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration  it was suppressed a little later than  the cemetery of mont parnasse  called the eastern cemetery  succeeded to it  and inherited that famous dram shop next to the vaugirard cemetery  which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board  and which formed an angle  one side on the drinkers  tables and the other on the tombs  with this sign  au bon coing the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery  it was falling into disuse  dampness was invading it  the flowers were deserting it  the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard  it hinted at poverty  pere lachaise if you please  to be buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognized as elegant  the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure  planted like an old fashioned french garden  straight alleys box  thuya trees  holly  ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees  and very tall grass  in the evening it was tragic there  there were very lugubrious lines about it the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pall and the black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery  the lame man who followed it was no other than fauchelevent the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar  the exit of cosette  the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all had been executed without difficulty  and there had been no hitch let us remark in passing  that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight  it is one of the faults which resemble a duty  the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty  but even with the applause of their own consciences  in the cloister  what is called the government  is only an intermeddling with authority  an interference which is always questionable  in the first place  the rule  as for the code  we shall see  make as many laws as you please  men  but keep them for yourselves the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god  a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle fauchelevent limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind  his twin plots  the one with the nuns  the one for the convent the other against it  the other with m  madeleine  had succeeded  to all appearance  jean valjean s composure was one of those powerful tranquillities which are contagious  fauchelevent no longer felt doubtful as to his success what remained to be done was a mere nothing  within the last two years he had made good father mestienne  a chubby cheeked person  drunk at least ten times  he played with father mestienne  he did what he liked with him  he made him dance according to his whim  mestienne s head adjusted itself to the cap of fauchelevent s will  fauchelevent s confidence was perfect at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery  fauchelevent glanced cheerfully at the hearse  and said half aloud  as he rubbed his big hands here s a fine farce all at once the hearse halted  it had reached the gate  the permission for interment must be exhibited  the undertaker s man addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery  during this colloquy  which always is productive of a delay of from one to two minutes  some one  a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse  beside fauchelevent  he was a sort of laboring man  who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm fauchelevent surveyed this stranger who are you  he demanded the man replied the grave digger if a man could survive the blow of a cannon ball full in the breast  he would make the same face that fauchelevent made the grave digger yes you i father mestienne is the grave digger he was what  he was he is dead fauchelevent had expected anything but this  that a grave digger could die  it is true  nevertheless  that grave diggers do die themselves  by dint of excavating graves for other people  one hollows out one s own fauchelevent stood there with his mouth wide open  he had hardly the strength to stammer but it is not possible it is so but  he persisted feebly  father mestienne is the grave digger after napoleon  louis xviii  after mestienne  gribier  peasant  my name is gribier fauchelevent  who was deadly pale  stared at this gribier he was a tall  thin  livid  utterly funereal man  he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger fauchelevent burst out laughing ah  said he  what queer things do happen  father mestienne is dead but long live little father lenoir  do you know who little father lenoir is  he is a jug of red wine  it is a jug of surene  morbigou  of real paris surene  ah  so old mestienne is dead  i am sorry for it  he was a jolly fellow  but you are a jolly fellow  too  are you not  comrade we ll go and have a drink together presently the man replied i have been a student  i passed my fourth examination  i never drink the hearse had set out again  and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery fauchelevent had slackened his pace  he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity the grave digger walked on in front of him fauchelevent passed the unexpected gribier once more in review he was one of those men who  though very young  have the air of age  and who  though slender  are extremely strong comrade  cried fauchelevent the man turned round i am the convent grave digger my colleague  said the man fauchelevent  who was illiterate but very sharp  understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man  with a fine talker  he muttered so father mestienne is dead the man replied completely  the good god consulted his note book which shows when the time is up  it was father mestienne s turn  father mestienne died fauchelevent repeated mechanically  the good god the good god  said the man authoritatively  according to the philosophers  the eternal father  according to the jacobins  the supreme being shall we not make each other s acquaintance  stammered fauchelevent it is made  you are a peasant  i am a parisian people do not know each other until they have drunk together  he who empties his glass empties his heart  you must come and have a drink with me  such a thing cannot be refused business first fauchelevent thought  i am lost they were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nuns  corner the grave digger resumed peasant  i have seven small children who must be fed  as they must eat i cannot drink and he added  with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well their hunger is the enemy of my thirst the hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees  quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one  entered the waste land  and plunged into a thicket  this indicated the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture  fauchelevent slackened his pace  but he could not detain the hearse  fortunately  the soil  which was light and wet with the winter rains  clogged the wheels and retarded its speed he approached the grave digger they have such a nice little argenteuil wine  murmured fauchelevent villager  retorted the man  i ought not be a grave digger  my father was a porter at the prytaneum town hall  he destined me for literature  but he had reverses  he had losses on change  i was obliged to renounce the profession of author  but i am still a public writer so you are not a grave digger  then  returned fauchelevent  clutching at this branch  feeble as it was the one does not hinder the other  i cumulate fauchelevent did not understand this last word come have a drink  said he here a remark becomes necessary  fauchelevent  whatever his anguish offered a drink  but he did not explain himself on one point  who was to pay  generally  fauchelevent offered and father mestienne paid  an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave digger  and it was necessary to make this offer  but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark  and that not unintentionally  as for himself  fauchelevent did not wish to pay  troubled as he was the grave digger went on with a superior smile one must eat  i have accepted father mestienne s reversion  one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes  to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm  i have my scrivener s stall in the market of the rue de sevres  you know  the umbrella market  all the cooks of the red cross apply to me  i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers  in the morning i write love letters  in the evening i dig graves  such is life  rustic the hearse was still advancing  fauchelevent  uneasy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides  great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow but  continued the grave digger  a man cannot serve two mistresses i must choose between the pen and the mattock  the mattock is ruining my hand the hearse halted the choir boy alighted from the mourning coach  then the priest one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth  beyond which an open grave was visible what a farce this is  repeated fauchelevent in consternation chapter vi between four planks who was in the coffin  the reader knows  jean valjean jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there  and he could almost breathe it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest  every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing  and progressing favorably  since the preceding day he  like fauchelevent  counted on father mestienne  he had no doubt as to the end  never was there a more critical situation  never more complete composure the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace  it seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean valjean s tranquillity from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow  and he had followed  all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death shortly after fauchelevent had finished nailing on the upper plank  jean valjean had felt himself carried out  then driven off  he knew  from the diminution in the jolting  when they left the pavements and reached the earth road  he had divined  from a dull noise  that they were crossing the bridge of austerlitz  at the first halt  he had understood that they were entering the cemetery  at the second halt  he said to himself here is the grave suddenly  he felt hands seize the coffin  then a harsh grating against the planks  he explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity then he experienced a giddiness the undertaker s man and the grave digger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance  and had lowered the head before the foot  he recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless he had just touched the bottom he had a certain sensation of cold a voice rose above him  glacial and solemn  he heard latin words  which he did not understand  pass over him  so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one qui dormiunt in terrae pulvere  evigilabunt  alii in vitam aeternam  et alii in approbrium  ut videant semper a child s voice said de profundis the grave voice began again requiem aeternam dona ei  domine the child s voice responded et lux perpetua luceat ei he heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him  it was probably the holy water he thought  this will be over soon now  patience for a little while longer  the priest will take his departure  fauchelevent will take mestienne off to drink  i shall be left  then fauchelevent will return alone  and i shall get out  that will be the work of a good hour the grave voice resumed requiescat in pace and the child s voice said amen jean valjean strained his ears  and heard something like retreating footsteps there  they are going now  thought he  i am alone all at once  he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder it was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin a second shovelful fell one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up a third shovelful of earth fell then a fourth there are things which are too strong for the strongest man  jean valjean lost consciousness chapter vii in which will be found the origin of the saying  don t lose the card this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean when the hearse had driven off  when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure  fauchelevent  who had not taken his eyes from the grave digger  saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel  which was sticking upright in the heap of dirt then fauchelevent took a supreme resolve he placed himself between the grave and the grave digger  crossed his arms and said i am the one to pay the grave digger stared at him in amazement  and replied what s that  peasant fauchelevent repeated i am the one who pays what for the wine what wine that argenteuil wine where is the argenteuil at the bon coing go to the devil  said the grave digger and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin the coffin gave back a hollow sound  fauchelevent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself  he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle comrade  before the bon coing is shut the grave digger took some more earth on his shovel  fauchelevent continued i will pay and he seized the man s arm listen to me  comrade  i am the convent grave digger  i have come to help you  it is a business which can be performed at night  let us begin  then  by going for a drink and as he spoke  and clung to this desperate insistence  this melancholy reflection occurred to him  and if he drinks  will he get drunk provincial  said the man  if you positively insist upon it  i consent  we will drink  after work  never before and he flourished his shovel briskly  fauchelevent held him back it is argenteuil wine  at six oh  come  said the grave digger  you are a bell ringer  ding dong ding dong  that s all you know how to say  go hang yourself and he threw in a second shovelful fauchelevent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying come along and drink  he cried  since it is i who pays the bill when we have put the child to bed  said the grave digger he flung in a third shovelful then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added it s cold to night  you see  and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet at that moment  as he loaded his shovel  the grave digger bent over and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped  fauchelevent s wild gaze fell mechanically into that pocket  and there it stopped the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon  there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traversed fauchelevent s pupils  an idea had just occurred to him he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind  without the grave digger  who was wholly absorbed in his shovelful of earth observing it  and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it the man sent a fourth shovelful tumbling into the grave just as he turned round to get the fifth  fauchelevent looked calmly at him and said by the way  you new man  have you your card the grave digger paused what card the sun is on the point of setting that s good  it is going to put on its nightcap the gate of the cemetery will close immediately well  what then have you your card ah  my card  said the grave digger and he fumbled in his pocket having searched one pocket  he proceeded to search the other  he passed on to his fobs  explored the first  returned to the second why  no  said he  i have not my card  i must have forgotten it fifteen francs fine  said fauchelevent the grave digger turned green  green is the pallor of livid people ah  jesus mon dieu bancroche a bas la lune  he exclaimed  fifteen francs fine three pieces of a hundred sous  said fauchelevent the grave digger dropped his shovel fauchelevent s turn had come ah  come now  conscript  said fauchelevent  none of this despair there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave fifteen francs is fifteen francs  and besides  you may not be able to pay it  i am an old hand  you are a new one  i know all the ropes and the devices  i will give you some friendly advice  one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting  it is touching the dome now  the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more that is true  replied the man five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave  it is as hollow as the devil  this grave  and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut that is true in that case  a fine of fifteen francs fifteen francs but you have time  where do you live a couple of steps from the barrier  a quarter of an hour from here  no  rue de vaugirard you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed that is exactly so once outside the gate  you gallop home  you get your card  you return the cemetery porter admits you  as you have your card  there will be nothing to pay  and you will bury your corpse  i ll watch it for you in the meantime  so that it shall not run away i am indebted to you for my life  peasant decamp  said fauchelevent the grave digger  overwhelmed with gratitude  shook his hand and set off on a run when the man had disappeared in the thicket  fauchelevent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance  then he leaned over the grave  and said in a low tone father madeleine there was no reply fauchelevent was seized with a shudder  he tumbled rather than climbed into the grave  flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried are you there silence in the coffin fauchelevent  hardly able to draw his breath for trembling  seized his cold chisel and his hammer  and pried up the coffin lid jean valjean s face appeared in the twilight  it was pale and his eyes were closed fauchelevent s hair rose upright on his head  he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave  ready to swoon on the coffin  he stared at jean valjean jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless fauchelevent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh he is dead and  drawing himself up  and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulders  he cried and this is the way i save his life then the poor man fell to sobbing  he soliloquized the while  for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural  powerful emotion often talks aloud it is father mestienne s fault  why did that fool die  what need was there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it  it is he who has killed m  madeleine  father madeleine he is in the coffin  it is quite handy  all is over  now  is there any sense in these things  ah  my god  he is dead  well  and his little girl  what am i to do with her  what will the fruit seller say  the idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this  when i think how he put himself under that cart  father madeleine  father madeleine pardine  he was suffocated  i said so  he wouldn t believe me  well here s a pretty trick to play  he is dead  that good man  the very best man out of all the good god s good folks  and his little girl  ah  in the first place  i won t go back there myself  i shall stay here  after having done such a thing as that  what s the use of being two old men if we are two old fools  but  in the first place  how did he manage to enter the convent  that was the beginning of it all  one should not do such things  father madeleine  father madeleine  father madeleine madeleine  monsieur madeleine  monsieur le maire  he does not hear me now get out of this scrape if you can and he tore his hair a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance  it was the cemetery gate closing fauchelevent bent over jean valjean  and all at once he bounded back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit jean valjean s eyes were open and gazing at him to see a corpse is alarming  to behold a resurrection is almost as much so  fauchelevent became like stone  pale  haggard  overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion  not knowing whether he had to do with a living man or a dead one  and staring at jean valjean  who was gazing at him illustration  the resurrection b resurrection i fell asleep  said jean valjean and he raised himself to a sitting posture fauchelevent fell on his knees just  good virgin  how you frightened me then he sprang to his feet and cried thanks  father madeleine jean valjean had merely fainted  the fresh air had revived him joy is the ebb of terror  fauchelevent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had so you are not dead  oh  how wise you are  i called you so much that you came back  when i saw your eyes shut  i said  good  there he is stifled  i should have gone raving mad  mad enough for a strait jacket they would have put me in bicetre  what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead  and your little girl  there s that fruit seller she would never have understood it  the child is thrust into your arms  and then the grandfather is dead  what a story  good saints of paradise  what a tale  ah  you are alive  that s the best of it i am cold  said jean valjean this remark recalled fauchelevent thoroughly to reality  and there was pressing need of it  the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves  although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny  which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place let us get out of here quickly  exclaimed fauchelevent he fumbled in his pocket  and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself but first  take a drop  said he the flask finished what the fresh air had begun  jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy  and regained full possession of his faculties he got out of the coffin  and helped fauchelevent to nail on the lid again three minutes later they were out of the grave moreover  fauchelevent was perfectly composed  he took his time  the cemetery was closed  the arrival of the grave digger gribier was not to be apprehended  that conscript  was at home busily engaged in looking for his card  and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings since it was in fauchelevent s pocket  without a card  he could not get back into the cemetery fauchelevent took the shovel  and jean valjean the pick axe  and together they buried the empty coffin when the grave was full  fauchelevent said to jean valjean let us go  i will keep the shovel  do you carry off the mattock night was falling jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking  he had stiffened himself in that coffin  and had become a little like a corpse  the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks  he had  in a manner  to thaw out  from the tomb you are benumbed  said fauchelevent  it is a pity that i have a game leg  for otherwise we might step out briskly bah  replied jean valjean  four paces will put life into my legs once more they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed  on arriving before the closed gate and the porter s pavilion fauchelevent who held the grave digger s card in his hand  dropped it into the box the porter pulled the rope  the gate opened  and they went out how well everything is going  said fauchelevent  what a capital idea that was of yours  father madeleine they passed the vaugirard barrier in the simplest manner in the world in the neighborhood of the cemetery  a shovel and pick are equal to two passports the rue vaugirard was deserted father madeleine  said fauchelevent as they went along  and raising his eyes to the houses  your eyes are better than mine  show me no here it is  said jean valjean there is no one in the street  said fauchelevent  give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me fauchelevent entered no   ascended to the very top  guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret  and knocked in the dark  at the door of an attic a voice replied  come in it was gribier s voice fauchelevent opened the door  the grave digger s dwelling was  like all such wretched habitations  an unfurnished and encumbered garret a packing case a coffin  perhaps took the place of a commode  a butter pot served for a drinking fountain  a straw mattress served for a bed  the floor served instead of tables and chairs  in a corner  on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet  a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap  the whole of this poverty stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned  one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one  the covers were displaced  the rags scattered about  the jug broken  the mother had been crying  the children had probably been beaten  traces of a vigorous and ill tempered search  it was plain that the grave digger had made a desperate search for his card  and had made everybody in the garret from the jug to his wife  responsible for its loss  he wore an air of desperation but fauchelevent was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success he entered and said i have brought you back your shovel and pick gribier gazed at him in stupefaction is it you  peasant and to morrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor what is the meaning of this  demanded gribier the meaning of it is  that you dropped your card out of your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were gone  that i have buried the corpse  that i have filled the grave  that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you  and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs  there you have it  conscript thanks  villager  exclaimed gribier  radiant  the next time i will pay for the drinks chapter viii a successful interrogatory an hour later  in the darkness of night  two men and a child presented themselves at no   rue petit picpus  the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped they were fauchelevent  jean valjean  and cosette the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the fruiterer s in the rue du chemin vert  where fauchelevent had deposited her on the preceding day  cosette had passed these twenty four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing  she trembled to such a degree that she wept  she had neither eaten nor slept  the worthy fruit seller had plied her with a hundred questions  without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze  cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days  she divined that they were passing through a crisis  she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good  who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words  pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being  say nothing  fear is mute  moreover  no one guards a secret like a child but when  at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty four hours  she beheld jean valjean again  she gave vent to such a cry of joy  that any thoughtful person who had chanced to hear that cry  would have guessed that it issued from an abyss fauchelevent belonged to the convent and knew the pass words  all the doors opened thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in the porter  who had received his instructions  opened the little servant s door which connected the courtyard with the garden  and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago  in the wall at the bottom of the court  which faced the carriage entrance the porter admitted all three of them through this door  and from that point they reached the inner  reserved parlor where fauchelevent  on the preceding day  had received his orders from the prioress the prioress  rosary in hand  was waiting for them  a vocal mother  with her veil lowered  stood beside her a discreet candle lighted  one might almost say  made a show of lighting the parlor the prioress passed jean valjean in review  there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye then she questioned him you are the brother yes  reverend mother  replied fauchelevent what is your name fauchelevent replied ultime fauchelevent he really had had a brother named ultime  who was dead where do you come from fauchelevent replied from picquigny  near amiens what is your age fauchelevent replied fifty what is your profession fauchelevent replied gardener are you a good christian fauchelevent replied every one is in the family is this your little girl fauchelevent replied yes  reverend mother you are her father fauchelevent replied her grandfather the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice he answers well jean valjean had not uttered a single word the prioress looked attentively at cosette  and said half aloud to the vocal mother she will grow up ugly the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor  then the prioress turned round and said father fauvent  you will get another knee cap with a bell  two will be required now on the following day  therefore  two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils  at the extreme end of the garden  under the trees  two men  fauvent and another man  were visible as they dug side by side  an enormous event  their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other  he is an assistant gardener the vocal mothers added  he is a brother of father fauvent jean valjean was  in fact  regularly installed  he had his belled knee cap  henceforth he was official  his name was ultime fauchelevent the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress s observation upon cosette  she will grow up ugly the prioress  that pronounced prognosticator  immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent  women are conscious of their faces  now  girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns  the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks  more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty  hence a lively taste for plain girls the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good  old fauchelevent  he won a triple success  in the eyes of jean valjean  whom he had saved and sheltered  in those of grave digger gribier  who said to himself  he spared me that fine  with the convent  which  being enabled  thanks to him  to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar  eluded caesar and satisfied god  there was a coffin containing a body in the petit picpus  and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery  public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby  but no one was aware of it as for the convent  its gratitude to fauchelevent was very great fauchelevent became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners  upon the occasion of the archbishop s next visit  the prioress recounted the affair to his grace  making something of a confession at the same time  and yet boasting of her deed  on leaving the convent  the archbishop mentioned it with approval  and in a whisper to m  de latil  monsieur s confessor  afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal  this admiration for fauchelevent became widespread  for it made its way to rome  we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope  leo xii  to one of his relatives  a monsignor in the nuncio s establishment in paris  and bearing  like himself  the name of della genga  it contained these lines  it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener  who is also a holy man  named fauvent nothing of this triumph reached fauchelevent in his hut  he went on grafting  weeding  and covering up his melon beds  without in the least suspecting his excellences and his sanctity  neither did he suspect his glory  any more than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news  with this inscription  bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show chapter ix cloistered cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean valjean s daughter  moreover  as she knew nothing  she could say nothing  and then  she would not have said anything in any case  as we have just observed  nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness  cosette had suffered so much  that she feared everything  even to speak or to breathe  a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean  she speedily became accustomed to the convent  only she regretted catherine  but she dared not say so  once  however  she did say to jean valjean  father  if i had known  i would have brought her away with me cosette had been obliged  on becoming a scholar in the convent  to don the garb of the pupils of the house  jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside  this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the thenardiers  inn  it was not very threadbare even now  jean valjean locked up these garments  plus the stockings and the shoes  with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound  in a little valise which he found means of procuring  he set this valise on a chair near his bed  and he always carried the key about his person father  cosette asked him one day  what is there in that box which smells so good father fauchelevent received other recompense for his good action  in addition to the glory which we just mentioned  and of which he knew nothing  in the first place it made him happy  next  he had much less work  since it was shared  lastly  as he was very fond of snuff  he found the presence of m  madeleine an advantage  in that he used three times as much as he had done previously  and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner  seeing that m  madeleine paid for it the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime  they called jean valjean the other fauvent if these holy women had possessed anything of javert s glance  they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden  it was always the elder fauchelevent  the old  the infirm  the lame man  who went  and never the other  but whether it is that eyes constantly fixed on god know not how to spy  or whether they were  by preference  occupied in keeping watch on each other  they paid no heed to this moreover  it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out  javert watched the quarter for more than a month this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulfs henceforth  those four walls constituted his world  he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity  and cosette enough to remain happy a very sweet life began for him he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden  in company with fauchelevent  this hovel  built of old rubbish  which was still in existence in  was composed  as the reader already knows  of three chambers  all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls  the principal one had been given up  by force  for jean valjean had opposed it in vain  to m  madeleine  by father fauchelevent  the walls of this chamber had for ornament  in addition to the two nails whereon to hang the knee cap and the basket  a royalist bank note of  applied to the wall over the chimney piece  and of which the following is an exact facsimile illustration  royalist bank note  b banknote this specimen of vendean paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener  an old chouan  who had died in the convent  and whose place fauchelevent had taken jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful  he had formerly been a pruner of trees  and he gladly found himself a gardener once more  it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture  he turned these to advantage  almost all the trees in the orchard were ungrafted  and wild he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day  as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind  the child made comparisons and adored him  at the appointed hour she flew to the hut  when she entered the lowly cabin  she filled it with paradise  jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette  the joy which we inspire has this charming property  that  far from growing meagre  like all reflections  it returns to us more radiant than ever  at recreation hours  jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance  and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest for cosette laughed now cosette s face had even undergone a change  to a certain extent  the gloom had disappeared from it  a smile is the same as sunshine  it banishes winter from the human countenance recreation over  when cosette went into the house again  jean valjean gazed at the windows of her class room  and at night he rose to look at the windows of her dormitory god has his own ways  moreover  the convent contributed  like cosette to uphold and complete the bishop s work in jean valjean  it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side  a bridge built by the devil exists there  jean valjean had been  unconsciously  perhaps  tolerably near that side and that bridge  when providence cast his lot in the convent of the petit picpus  so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop  he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for some time past he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up  who knows  he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred the convent stopped him on that downward path this was the second place of captivity which he had seen  in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life  and later on  quite recently again  he had beheld another a frightful place  a terrible place  whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice  and the crime of the law  now  after the galleys  he saw the cloister  and when he meditated how he had formed a part of the galleys and that he now  so to speak  was a spectator of the cloister  he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe  and slowly descended the endless spirals of revery he recalled his former companions  how wretched they were  they rose at dawn  and toiled until night  hardly were they permitted to sleep  they lay on camp beds  where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick  in rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year  they were clothed in frightful red blouses  they were allowed as a great favor  linen trousers in the hottest weather  and a woollen carter s blouse on their backs when it was very cold  they drank no wine  and ate no meat  except when they went on fatigue duty  they lived nameless  designated only by numbers  and converted  after a manner  into ciphers themselves  with downcast eyes  with lowered voices  with shorn heads  beneath the cudgel and in disgrace then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes these beings also lived with shorn heads  with downcast eyes  with lowered voices  not in disgrace  but amid the scoffs of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel  but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline  their names  also  had vanished from among men  they no longer existed except under austere appellations they never ate meat and they never drank wine  they often remained until evening without food  they were attired  not in a red blouse  but in a black shroud  of woollen  which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it  without having even  according to the season  the resource of the linen garment or the woollen cloak  and for six months in the year they wore serge chemises which gave them fever  they dwelt  not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold  but in cells where no fire was ever lighted  they slept not on mattresses two inches thick  but on straw  and finally  they were not even allowed their sleep  every night  after a day of toil  they were obliged  in the weariness of their first slumber  at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm  to rouse themselves  to rise and to go and pray in an ice cold and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture  or prostrate  with face upon the pavement  and arms outstretched in the form of a cross the others were men  these were women what had those men done  they had stolen  violated  pillaged murdered  assassinated  they were bandits  counterfeiters  poisoners incendiaries  murderers  parricides  what had these women done  they had done nothing whatever on the one hand  highway robbery  fraud  deceit  violence  sensuality homicide  all sorts of sacrilege  every variety of crime  on the other one thing only  innocence perfect innocence  almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption  attached to the earth by virtue  already possessing something of heaven through holiness on the one hand  confidences over crimes  which are exchanged in whispers  on the other  the confession of faults made aloud  and what crimes  and what faults on the one hand  miasms  on the other  an ineffable perfume  on the one hand  a moral pest  guarded from sight  penned up under the range of cannon  and literally devouring its plague stricken victims  on the other  the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth  there darkness  here  the shadow  but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance two strongholds of slavery  but in the first  deliverance possible a legal limit always in sight  and then  escape  in the second perpetuity  the sole hope  at the distant extremity of the future  that faint light of liberty which men call death in the first  men are bound only with chains  in the other  chained by faith what flowed from the first  an immense curse  the gnashing of teeth hatred  desperate viciousness  a cry of rage against human society  a sarcasm against heaven what results flowed from the second  blessings and love and in these two places  so similar yet so unlike  these two species of beings who were so very unlike  were undergoing the same work expiation jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former  that personal expiation  the expiation for one s self  but he did not understand that of these last  that of creatures without reproach and without stain  and he trembled as he asked himself  the expiation of what  what expiation a voice within his conscience replied  the most divine of human generosities  the expiation for others here all personal theory is withheld  we are only the narrator  we place ourselves at jean valjean s point of view  and we translate his impressions before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation  the highest possible pitch of virtue  the innocence which pardons men their faults and which expiates in their stead  servitude submitted to  torture accepted  punishment claimed by souls which have not sinned  for the sake of sparing it to souls which have fallen  the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god  but even there preserving its distinct and mediatorial character  sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed and he remembered that he had dared to murmur often  in the middle of the night  he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities  and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy  and that he wretch that he was  had shaken his fist at god there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply  like a warning whisper from providence itself  the scaling of that wall  the passing of those barriers  the adventure accepted even at the risk of death  the painful and difficult ascent  all those efforts even  which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation  he had made in order to gain entrance into this one  was this a symbol of his destiny this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled  and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar again he beheld gratings  bolts  iron bars to guard whom  angels these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers  he now beheld once more around lambs this was a place of expiation  and not of punishment  and yet  it was still more austere  more gloomy  and more pitiless than the other these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts  a cold harsh wind  that wind which had chilled his youth  traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures  a still harsher and more biting breeze blew in the cage of these doves why when he thought on these things  all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity in these meditations  his pride vanished  he scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways  he felt his pettiness  and many a time he wept all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the bishop s holy injunctions  cosette through love  the convent through humility sometimes at eventide  in the twilight  at an hour when the garden was deserted  he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel  in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival  and turned towards the spot where  as he knew the sister was making reparation  prostrated in prayer  thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god everything that surrounded him  that peaceful garden  those fragrant flowers  those children who uttered joyous cries  those grave and simple women  that silent cloister  slowly permeated him  and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister  of perfume like the flowers  of simplicity like the women  of joy like the children and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life  the first  when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second  at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him  and when the galleys were again yawning  and that  had it not been for the first  he should have relapsed into crime  and had it not been for the second  into torment his whole heart melted in gratitude  and he loved more and more many years passed in this manner  cosette was growing up the end of volume ii  cosette volume iii marius illustration

is called the sparrow  the child is called the gamin couple these two ideas which contain  the one all the furnace  the other all the dawn  strike these two sparks together  paris  childhood  there leaps out from them a little being  homuncio  plautus would say this little being is joyous  he has not food every day  and he goes to the play every evening  if he sees good  he has no shirt on his body no shoes on his feet  no roof over his head  he is like the flies of heaven  who have none of these things  he is from seven to thirteen years of age  he lives in bands  roams the streets  lodges in the open air  wears an old pair of trousers of his father s  which descend below his heels  an old hat of some other father  which descends below his ears  a single suspender of yellow listing  he runs  lies in wait rummages about  wastes time  blackens pipes  swears like a convict haunts the wine shop  knows thieves  calls gay women thou  talks slang sings obscene songs  and has no evil in his heart  this is because he has in his heart a pearl  innocence  and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud  so long as man is in his childhood  god wills that he shall be innocent if one were to ask that enormous city  what is this  she would reply it is my little one chapter ii some of his particular characteristics the gamin the street arab of paris is the dwarf of the giant let us not exaggerate  this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a shirt but  in that case  he owns but one  he sometimes has shoes  but then they have no soles  he sometimes has a lodging  and he loves it  for he finds his mother there  but he prefers the street  because there he finds liberty  he has his own games  his own bits of mischief  whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois  his peculiar metaphors to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root  his own occupations calling hackney coaches  letting down carriage steps  establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains  which he calls making the bridge of arts  crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the french people  cleaning out the cracks in the pavement  he has his own coinage  which is composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets this curious money  which receives the name of loques rags has an invariable and well regulated currency in this little bohemia of children lastly  he has his own fauna  which he observes attentively in the corners  the lady bird  the death s head plant louse  the daddy long legs  the devil  a black insect  which menaces by twisting about its tail armed with two horns  he has his fabulous monster  which has scales under its belly  but is not a lizard  which has pustules on its back  but is not a toad  which inhabits the nooks of old lime kilns and wells that have run dry  which is black  hairy  sticky  which crawls sometimes slowly  sometimes rapidly  which has no cry  but which has a look  and is so terrible that no one has ever beheld it  he calls this monster the deaf thing  the search for these deaf things  among the stones is a joy of formidable nature  another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving stone  and taking a look at the wood lice each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there  there are ear wigs in the timber yards of the ursulines  there are millepeds in the pantheon  there are tadpoles in the ditches of the champs de mars as far as sayings are concerned  this child has as many of them as talleyrand  he is no less cynical  but he is more honest  he is endowed with a certain indescribable  unexpected joviality  he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter  he ranges boldly from high comedy to farce a funeral passes by  among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor  hey there  shouts some street arab  how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work another is in a crowd  a grave man  adorned with spectacles and trinkets  turns round indignantly  you good for nothing  you have seized my wife s waist i  sir  search me chapter iii he is agreeable in the evening  thanks to a few sous  which he always finds means to procure  the homuncio enters a theatre  on crossing that magic threshold  he becomes transfigured  he was the street arab  he becomes the titi  theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air  it is in that keel that the titi huddle together the titi is to the gamin what the moth is to the larva  the same being endowed with wings and soaring  it suffices for him to be there  with his radiance of happiness  with his power of enthusiasm and joy  with his hand clapping  which resembles a clapping of wings  to confer on that narrow  dark  fetid  sordid  unhealthy  hideous  abominable keel the name of paradise bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary and you have the gamin the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition  his tendency  and we say it with the proper amount of regret  would not constitute classic taste  he is not very academic by nature  thus  to give an example  the popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony  the gamin called her mademoiselle muche hide yourself this being bawls and scoffs and ridicules and fights  has rags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher  fishes in the sewer  hunts in the cesspool  extracts mirth from foulness  whips up the squares with his wit  grins and bites  whistles and sings  shouts  and shrieks  tempers alleluia with matantur lurette  chants every rhythm from the de profundis to the jack pudding  finds without seeking  knows what he is ignorant of  is a spartan to the point of thieving  is mad to wisdom  is lyrical to filth  would crouch down on olympus  wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars  the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth he is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch pocket he is not easily astonished  he is still less easily terrified  he makes songs on superstitions  he takes the wind out of exaggerations  he twits mysteries  he thrusts out his tongue at ghosts  he takes the poetry out of stilted things  he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas it is not that he is prosaic  far from that  but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria  if adamastor were to appear to him  the street arab would say  hi there  the bugaboo chapter iv he may be of use paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street arab  two beings of which no other city is capable  the passive acceptance  which contents itself with gazing  and the inexhaustible initiative  prudhomme and fouillou  paris alone has this in its natural history  the whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger  the whole of anarchy in the gamin this pale child of the parisian faubourgs lives and develops  makes connections  grows supple  in suffering  in the presence of social realities and of human things  a thoughtful witness  he thinks himself heedless  and he is not  he looks and is on the verge of laughter  he is on the verge of something else also  whoever you may be  if your name is prejudice  abuse  ignorance  oppression  iniquity  despotism  injustice fanaticism  tyranny  beware of the gaping gamin the little fellow will grow up of what clay is he made  of the first mud that comes to hand  a handful of dirt  a breath  and behold adam  it suffices for a god to pass by  a god has always passed over the street arab  fortune labors at this tiny being  by the word fortune  we mean chance  to some extent  that pigmy kneaded out of common earth  ignorant  unlettered  giddy  vulgar  low will that become an ionian or a boeotian  wait  currit rota  the spirit of paris  that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny  reversing the process of the latin potter  makes of a jug an amphora chapter v his frontiers the gamin loves the city  he also loves solitude  since he has something of the sage in him  urbis amator  like fuscus  ruris amator  like flaccus to roam thoughtfully about  that is to say  to lounge  is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher  particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign  which is tolerably ugly but odd and composed of two natures  which surrounds certain great cities notably paris  to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal end of the trees  beginning of the roofs  end of the grass  beginning of the pavements  end of the furrows  beginning of the shops  end of the wheel ruts  beginning of the passions  end of the divine murmur beginning of the human uproar  hence an extraordinary interest hence  in these not very attractive places  indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet  melancholy  the apparently objectless promenades of the dreamer he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of paris  and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs  that close shaven turf  those pebbly paths  that chalk  those pools those harsh monotonies of waste and fallow lands  the plants of early market garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom  that mixture of the savage and the citizen  those vast desert nooks where the garrison drums practise noisily  and produce a sort of lisping of battle  those hermits by day and cut throats by night  that clumsy mill which turns in the wind  the hoisting wheels of the quarries  the tea gardens at the corners of the cemeteries  the mysterious charm of great  sombre walls squarely intersecting immense  vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies all this attracted him there is hardly any one on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots  the glaciere  the cunette  the hideous wall of grenelle all speckled with balls  mont parnasse  the fosse aux loups  aubiers on the bank of the marne  mont souris  the tombe issoire  the pierre plate de chatillon  where there is an old  exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms  and which is closed  on a level with the ground  by a trap door of rotten planks  the campagna of rome is one idea  the banlieue of paris is another  to behold nothing but fields  houses  or trees in what a stretch of country offers us  is to remain on the surface  all aspects of things are thoughts of god  the spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy  nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there  local originalities there make their appearance any one who  like ourselves  has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourgs  which may be designated as the limbos of paris  has seen here and there  in the most desert spot  at the most unexpected moment  behind a meagre hedge  or in the corner of a lugubrious wall  children grouped tumultuously  fetid  muddy dusty  ragged  dishevelled  playing hide and seek  and crowned with corn flowers  all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families  the outer boulevard is their breathing space  the suburbs belong to them  there they are eternally playing truant  there they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs  there they are  or rather  there they exist  far from every eye  in the sweet light of may or june  kneeling round a hole in the ground  snapping marbles with their thumbs  quarrelling over half farthings  irresponsible  volatile free and happy  and  no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry  and that they must earn their living  and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cockchafers  or a bunch of lilacs  these encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of paris sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they their sisters who are almost young maidens  thin  feverish  with sunburnt hands  covered with freckles  crowned with poppies and ears of rye  gay  haggard  barefooted  they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat  in the evening they can be heard laughing  these groups warmly illuminated by the full glow of midday  or indistinctly seen in the twilight  occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time  and these visions mingle with his dreams paris  centre  banlieue  circumference  this constitutes all the earth to those children  they never venture beyond this  they can no more escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water  for them  nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers ivry  gentilly  arcueil  belleville  aubervilliers  menilmontant choisy le roi  billancourt  mendon  issy

bit of history at the epoch  nearly contemporary by the way  when the action of this book takes place  there was not  as there is to day  a policeman at the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss here  stray children abounded in paris  the statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period  by the police patrols  in unenclosed lands  in houses in process of construction  and under the arches of the bridges  one of these nests  which has become famous  produced the swallows of the bridge of arcola  this is  moreover  the most disastrous of social symptoms  all crimes of the man begin in the vagabondage of the child let us make an exception in favor of paris  nevertheless  in a relative measure  and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled  the exception is just  while in any other great city the vagabond child is a lost man  while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is  in some sort  sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devour in him honesty and conscience  the street boy of paris  we insist on this point  however defaced and injured on the surface  is almost intact on the interior  it is a magnificent thing to put on record  and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions  that a certain incorruptibility results from the idea which exists in the air of paris  as salt exists in the water of the ocean  to breathe paris preserves the soul what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancies that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family  in the civilization of the present day  incomplete as it still is  it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness  not knowing clearly what has become of their children  and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway  hence these obscure destinies  this is called  for this sad thing has given rise to an expression  to be cast on the pavements of paris let it be said by the way  that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy  a little of egypt and bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres  and compassed the aims of the powerful  the hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma  what is the use of half lights  such was the countersign now  the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child besides this  the monarchy sometimes was in need of children  and in that case it skimmed the streets under louis xiv  not to go any further back  the king rightly desired to create a fleet  the idea was a good one  but let us consider the means  there can be no fleet  if  beside the sailing ship  that plaything of the winds  and for the purpose of towing it  in case of necessity  there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases  either by means of oars or of steam  the galleys were then to the marine what steamers are to day  therefore  galleys were necessary  but the galley is moved only by the galley slave  hence  galley slaves were required colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliaments make as many convicts as possible  the magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter  a man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession it was a huguenot attitude  he was sent to the galleys  a child was encountered in the streets  provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep  he was sent to the galleys  grand reign  grand century under louis xv  children disappeared in paris  the police carried them off  for what mysterious purpose no one knew  people whispered with terror monstrous conjectures as to the king s baths of purple  barbier speaks ingenuously of these things  it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard  when they ran short of children  took those who had fathers  the fathers  in despair  attacked the exempts  in that case  the parliament intervened and had some one hung  who  the exempts no  the fathers chapter vii the gamin should have his place in the classifications of india the body of street arabs in paris almost constitutes a caste  one might almost say  not every one who wishes to belong to it can do so this word gamin was printed for the first time  and reached popular speech through the literary tongue  in  it is in a little work entitled claude gueux that this word made its appearance  the horror was lively  the word passed into circulation the elements which constitute the consideration of the gamins for each other are very various  we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of notre dame  another  because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the invalides had been temporarily deposited  and had prigged  some lead from them  a third  because he had seen a diligence tip over  still another  because he knew  a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin  a profound epiphonema  which the vulgar herd laughs at without comprehending dieu de dieu  what ill luck i do have  to think that i have never yet seen anybody tumble from a fifth story window  i have pronounced i ave and fifth pronounced fift surely  this saying of a peasant is a fine one  father so and so  your wife has died of her malady  why did you not send for the doctor what would you have  sir  we poor folks die of ourselves  but if the peasant s whole passivity lies in this saying  the whole of the free thinking anarchy of the brat of the faubourgs is  assuredly contained in this other saying  a man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the tumbrel  the child of paris exclaims  he is talking to his black cap  oh  the sneak a certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin  to be strong minded is an important item to be present at executions constitutes a duty  he shows himself at the guillotine  and he laughs  he calls it by all sorts of pet names  the end of the soup  the growler  the mother in the blue the sky  the last mouthful  etc  etc  in order not to lose anything of the affair  he scales the walls  he hoists himself to balconies  he ascends trees  he suspends himself to gratings  he clings fast to chimneys  the gamin is born a tiler as he is born a mariner  a roof inspires him with no more fear than a mast  there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place de greve  samson and the abbe montes are the truly popular names  they hoot at the victim in order to encourage him  they sometimes admire him  lacenaire  when a gamin  on seeing the hideous dautin die bravely  uttered these words which contain a future  i was jealous of him  in the brotherhood of gamins voltaire is not known  but papavoine is  politicians  are confused with assassins in the same legend they have a tradition as to everybody s last garment  it is known that tolleron had a fireman s cap  avril an otter cap  losvel a round hat that old delaporte was bald and bare headed  that castaing was all ruddy and very handsome  that bories had a romantic small beard  that jean martin kept on his suspenders  that lecouffe and his mother quarrelled don t reproach each other for your basket  shouted a gamin to them another  in order to get a look at debacker as he passed  and being too small in the crowd  caught sight of the lantern on the quay and climbed it  a gendarme stationed opposite frowned  let me climb up  m sieu le gendarme  said the gamin  and  to soften the heart of the authorities he added  i will not fall  i don t care if you do  retorted the gendarme in the brotherhood of gamins  a memorable accident counts for a great deal  one reaches the height of consideration if one chances to cut one s self very deeply  to the very bone the fist is no mediocre element of respect  one of the things that the gamin is fondest of saying is  i am fine and strong  come now  to be left handed renders you very enviable  a squint is highly esteemed chapter viii in which the reader will find a charming saying of the last king in summer  he metamorphoses himself into a frog  and in the evening when night is falling  in front of the bridges of austerlitz and jena from the tops of coal wagons  and the washerwomen s boats  he hurls himself headlong into the seine  and into all possible infractions of the laws of modesty and of the police  nevertheless the police keep an eye on him  and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable cry  that cry which was celebrated about  is a strategic warning from gamin to gamin  it scans like a verse from homer  with a notation as inexpressible as the eleusiac chant of the panathenaea  and in it one encounters again the ancient evohe  here it is  ohe  titi  oheee  here comes the bobby  here comes the p lice  pick up your duds and be off  through the sewer with you sometimes this gnat that is what he calls himself knows how to read sometimes he knows how to write  he always knows how to daub  he does not hesitate to acquire  by no one knows what mysterious mutual instruction  all the talents which can be of use to the public  from  to  he imitated the cry of the turkey  from  to  he scrawled pears on the walls  one summer evening  when louis philippe was returning home on foot  he saw a little fellow  no higher than his knee perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly  the king  with that good nature which came to him from henry iv  helped the gamin  finished the pear and gave the child a louis  saying  the pear is on that also the gamin loves uproar  a certain state of violence pleases him  he execrates the cures  one day  in the rue de l universite  one of these scamps was putting his thumb to his nose at the carriage gate of no  why are you doing that at the gate  a passer by asked  the boy replied  there is a cure there  it was there  in fact  that the papal nuncio lived nevertheless  whatever may be the voltairianism of the small gamin  if the occasion to become a chorister presents itself  it is quite possible that he will accept  and in that case he serves the mass civilly  there are two things to which he plays tantalus  and which he always desires without ever attaining them  to overthrow the government  and to get his trousers sewed up again the gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of paris  and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet  he can tell them off on the tips of his fingers  he studies their habits  and he has special notes on each one of them  he reads the souls of the police like an open book  he will tell you fluently and without flinching  such an one is a traitor  such another is very malicious such another is great  such another is ridiculous  all these words traitor  malicious  great  ridiculous  have a particular meaning in his mouth  that one imagines that he owns the pont neuf  and he prevents people from walking on the cornice outside the parapet  that other has a mania for pulling person s ears  etc  etc chapter ix the old soul of gaul there was something of that boy in poquelin  the son of the fish market beaumarchais had something of it  gaminerie is a shade of the gallic spirit  mingled with good sense  it sometimes adds force to the latter as alcohol does to wine  sometimes it is a defect  homer repeats himself eternally  granted  one may say that voltaire plays the gamin  camille desmoulins was a native of the faubourgs  championnet  who treated miracles brutally  rose from the pavements of paris  he had  when a small lad  inundated the porticos of saint jean de beauvais  and of saint etienne du mont  he had addressed the shrine of sainte genevieve familiarly to give orders to the phial of saint januarius the gamin of paris is respectful  ironical  and insolent  he has villainous teeth  because he is badly fed and his stomach suffers  and handsome eyes because he has wit  if jehovah himself were present  he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot  he is strong on boxing  all beliefs are possible to him  he plays in the gutter  and straightens himself up with a revolt  his effrontery persists even in the presence of grape shot  he was a scapegrace  he is a hero  like the little theban  he shakes the skin from the lion  barra the drummer boy was a gamin of paris  he shouts  forward  as the horse of scripture says vah  and in a moment he has passed from the small brat to the giant this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal  measure that spread of wings which reaches from moliere to barra to sum up the whole  and in one word  the gamin is a being who amuses himself  because he is unhappy chapter x ecce paris  ecce homo to sum it all up once more  the paris gamin of to day  like the graeculus of rome in days gone by  is the infant populace with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow the gamin is a grace to the nation  and at the same time a disease  a disease which must be cured  how  by light light renders healthy light kindles all generous social irradiations spring from

nine years after the events narrated in the second part of this story  people noticed on the boulevard du temple  and in the regions of the chateau d eau  a little boy eleven or twelve years of age  who would have realized with tolerable accuracy that ideal of the gamin sketched out above  if  with the laugh of his age on his lips  he had not had a heart absolutely sombre and empty  this child was well muffled up in a pair of man s trousers  but he did not get them from his father  and a woman s chemise  but he did not get it from his mother  some people or other had clothed him in rags out of charity  still  he had a father and a mother  but his father did not think of him  and his mother did not love him he was one of those children most deserving of pity  among all  one of those who have father and mother  and who are orphans nevertheless this child never felt so well as when he was in the street  the pavements were less hard to him than his mother s heart his parents had despatched him into life with a kick he simply took flight he was a boisterous  pallid  nimble  wide awake  jeering  lad  with a vivacious but sickly air  he went and came  sang  played at hopscotch scraped the gutters  stole a little  but  like cats and sparrows  gayly laughed when he was called a rogue  and got angry when called a thief he had no shelter  no bread  no fire  no love  but he was merry because he was free when these poor creatures grow to be men  the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them  but so long as they are children  they escape because of their smallness  the tiniest hole saves them nevertheless  abandoned as this child was  it sometimes happened  every two or three months  that he said  come  i ll go and see mamma  then he quitted the boulevard  the cirque  the porte saint martin  descended to the quays  crossed the bridges  reached the suburbs  arrived at the salpetriere  and came to a halt  where  precisely at that double number  with which the reader is acquainted at the gorbeau hovel at that epoch  the hovel  generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard  chambers to let  chanced to be  a rare thing  inhabited by numerous individuals who  however  as is always the case in paris  had no connection with each other  all belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances  and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end  the sewer man who sweeps up the mud  and the ragpicker who collects scraps the principal lodger  of jean valjean s day was dead and had been replaced by another exactly like her  i know not what philosopher has said  old women are never lacking this new old woman was named madame bourgon  and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three paroquets  who had reigned in succession over her soul the most miserable of those who inhabited the hovel were a family of four persons  consisting of father  mother  and two daughters  already well grown  all four of whom were lodged in the same attic  one of the cells which we have already mentioned at first sight  this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution  the father  when he hired the chamber  had stated that his name was jondrette  some time after his moving in  which had borne a singular resemblance to the entrance of nothing at all  to borrow the memorable expression of the principal tenant  this jondrette had said to the woman  who  like her predecessor  was at the same time portress and stair sweeper  mother so and so  if any one should chance to come and inquire for a pole or an italian  or even a spaniard perchance  it is i this family was that of the merry barefoot boy  he arrived there and found distress  and  what is still sadder  no smile  a cold hearth and cold hearts  when he entered  he was asked  whence come you  he replied  from the street  when he went away  they asked him  whither are you going  he replied  into the streets  his mother said to him what did you come here for this child lived  in this absence of affection  like the pale plants which spring up in cellars  it did not cause him suffering  and he blamed no one  he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be nevertheless  his mother loved his sisters we have forgotten to mention  that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche  why was he called little gavroche probably because his father s name was jondrette it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread the chamber which the jondrettes inhabited in the gorbeau hovel was the last at the end of the corridor  the cell next to it was occupied by a very poor young man who was called m  marius let us explain who this m  marius was book second the great bourgeois chapter i ninety years and thirty two teeth in the rue boucherat  rue de normandie and the rue de saintonge there still exist a few ancient inhabitants who have preserved the memory of a worthy man named m  gillenormand  and who mention him with complaisance this good man was old when they were young  this silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared for those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which  under louis xiv  the names of all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day  the streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of europe  a progression  by the way  in which progress is visible m gillenormand  who was as much alive as possible in  was one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed  simply because they have lived a long time  and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody  and now resemble nobody  he was a peculiar old man and in very truth  a man of another age  the real  complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century  who wore his good  old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their marquisates  he was over ninety years of age  his walk was erect  he talked loudly  saw clearly  drank neat  ate  slept  and snored  he had all thirty two of his teeth  he only wore spectacles when he read  he was of an amorous disposition  but declared that  for the last ten years  he had wholly and decidedly renounced women  he could no longer please  he said  he did not add  i am too old  but  i am too poor  he said  if i were not ruined heee  all he had left  in fact  was an income of about fifteen thousand francs  his dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for mistresses  he did not belong  as the reader will perceive  to that puny variety of octogenaries who  like m  de voltaire  have been dying all their life his was no longevity of a cracked pot  this jovial old man had always had good health  he was superficial  rapid  easily angered  he flew into a passion at everything  generally quite contrary to all reason  when contradicted  he raised his cane  he beat people as he had done in the great century  he had a daughter over fifty years of age  and unmarried whom he chastised severely with his tongue  when in a rage  and whom he would have liked to whip  she seemed to him to be eight years old  he boxed his servants  ears soundly  and said  ah  carogne  one of his oaths was  by the pantoufloche of the pantouflochade  he had singular freaks of tranquillity  he had himself shaved every day by a barber who had been mad and who detested him  being jealous of m  gillenormand on account of his wife  a pretty and coquettish barberess  m  gillenormand admired his own discernment in all things  and declared that he was extremely sagacious  here is one of his sayings  i have  in truth  some penetration  i am able to say when a flea bites me  from what woman it came the words which he uttered the most frequently were  the sensible man and nature  he did not give to this last word the grand acceptation which our epoch has accorded to it  but he made it enter  after his own fashion  into his little chimney corner satires  nature  he said  in order that civilization may have a little of everything  gives it even specimens of its amusing barbarism  europe possesses specimens of asia and africa on a small scale  the cat is a drawing room tiger  the lizard is a pocket crocodile  the dancers at the opera are pink female savages they do not eat men  they crunch them  or  magicians that they are  they transform them into oysters and swallow them  the caribbeans leave only the bones  they leave only the shell  such are our morals  we do not devour  we gnaw  we do not exterminate  we claw chapter ii like master  like house he lived in the marais  rue des filles du calvaire  no   he owned the house  this house has since been demolished and rebuilt  and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of paris undergo  he occupied an ancient and vast apartment on the first floor  between street and gardens  furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes  the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the arm chairs  he enveloped his bed in a vast nine leaved screen of coromandel lacquer  long  full curtains hung from the windows  and formed great  broken folds that were very magnificent the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle  by means of a staircase twelve or fifteen steps long  which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility  in addition to a library adjoining his chamber  he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deal  a gallant and elegant retreat with magnificent hangings of straw  with a pattern of flowers and fleurs de lys made on the galleys of louis xiv  and ordered of his convicts by m  de vivonne for his mistress  m  gillenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great aunt  who had died a centenarian  he had had two wives  his manners were something between those of the courtier  which he had never been  and the lawyer  which he might have been  he was gay  and caressing when he had a mind  in his youth he had been one of those men who are always deceived by their wives and never by their mistresses  because they are  at the same time  the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence  he was a connoisseur of painting  he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom  painted by jordaens  executed with great dashes of the brush  with millions of details  in a confused and hap hazard manner  m  gillenormand s attire was not the habit of louis xiv  nor yet that of louis xvi  it was that of the incroyables of the directory  he had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions  his coat was of light weight cloth with voluminous revers  a long swallow tail and large steel buttons  with this he wore knee breeches and buckle shoes  he always thrust his hands into his fobs  he said authoritatively  the french revolution is a heap of blackguards chapter iii luc esprit at the age of sixteen  one evening at the opera  he had had the honor to be stared at through opera glasses by two beauties at the same time ripe and celebrated beauties then  and sung by voltaire  the camargo and the salle  caught between two fires  he had beaten a heroic retreat towards a little dancer  a young girl named nahenry  who was sixteen like himself  obscure as a cat  and with whom he was in love he abounded in memories  he was accustomed to exclaim  how pretty she was that guimard guimardini guimardinette  the last time i saw her at longchamps  her hair curled in sustained sentiments  with her come and see of turquoises  her gown of the color of persons newly arrived  and her little agitation muff  he had worn in his young manhood a waistcoat of nain londrin  which he was fond of talking about effusively  i was dressed like a turk of the levant levantin  said he madame de boufflers  having seen him by chance when he was twenty  had described him as a charming fool  he was horrified by all the names which he saw in politics and in power  regarding them as vulgar and bourgeois  he read the journals  the newspapers  the gazettes as he said  stifling outbursts of laughter the while  oh  he said  what people these are  corbiere  humann  casimir perier  there s a minister for you  i can imagine this in a journal  m  gillenorman  minister that would be a farce  well  they are so stupid that it would pass  he merrily called everything by its name  whether decent or indecent  and did not restrain himself in the least before ladies  he uttered coarse speeches  obscenities  and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant  it was in keeping with the unceremoniousness of his century  it is to be noted that the age of periphrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose  his god father had predicted that he would turn out a man of genius  and had bestowed on him these two significant names  luc esprit chapter iv a centenarian aspirant he had taken prizes in his boyhood at the college of moulins  where he was born  and he had been crowned by the hand of the duc de nivernais whom he called the duc de nevers  neither the convention  nor the death of louis xvi  nor the napoleon  nor the return of the bourbons  nor anything else had been able to efface the memory of this crowning  the duc de nevers was  in his eyes  the great figure of the century  what a charming grand seigneur  he said  and what a fine air he had with his blue ribbon in the eyes of m  gillenormand  catherine the second had made reparation for the crime of the partition of poland by purchasing  for three thousand roubles  the secret of the elixir of gold  from bestucheff  he grew animated on this subject  the elixir of gold  he exclaimed  the yellow dye of bestucheff  general lamotte s drops  in the eighteenth century this was the great remedy for the catastrophes of love  the panacea against venus  at one louis the half ounce phial  louis xv sent two hundred phials of it to the pope  he would have been greatly irritated and thrown off his balance  had any one told him that the elixir of gold is nothing but the perchloride of iron  m  gillenormand adored the bourbons  and had a horror of  he was forever narrating in what manner he had saved himself during the terror  and how he had been obliged to display a vast deal of gayety and cleverness in order to escape having his head cut off  if any young man ventured to pronounce an eulogium on the republic in his presence  he turned purple and grew so angry that he was on the point of swooning  he sometimes alluded to his ninety years  and said  i hope that i shall not see ninety three twice  on these occasions  he hinted to people that he meant to live to be a hundred chapter v basque and nicolette he had theories  here is one of them  when a man is passionately fond of women  and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little who is homely  cross  legitimate  with plenty of rights  perched on the code  and jealous at need  there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace  and that is to let his wife control the purse strings  this abdication sets him free  then his wife busies herself  grows passionately fond of handling coin  gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process  undertakes the education of half share tenants and the training of farmers  convokes lawyers presides over notaries  harangues scriveners  visits limbs of the law follows lawsuits  draws up leases  dictates contracts  feels herself the sovereign  sells  buys  regulates  promises and compromises  binds fast and annuls  yields  concedes and retrocedes  arranges  disarranges hoards  lavishes  she commits follies  a supreme and personal delight and that consoles her  while her husband disdains her  she has the satisfaction of ruining her husband  this theory m  gillenormand had himself applied  and it had become his history  his wife the second one had administered his fortune in such a manner that  one fine day when m  gillenormand found himself a widower  there remained to him just sufficient to live on  by sinking nearly the whole of it in an annuity of fifteen thousand francs  three quarters of which would expire with him  he had not hesitated on this point  not being anxious to leave a property behind him  besides  he had noticed that patrimonies are subject to adventures  and  for instance  become national property  he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three per cents  and he had no great faith in the great book of the public debt  all that s the rue quincampois  he said  his house in the rue filles du clavaire belonged to him  as we have already stated  he had two servants  a male and a female  when a servant entered his establishment  m  gillenormand re baptized him  he bestowed on the men the name of their province nimois  comtois  poitevin  picard  his last valet was a big  foundered short winded fellow of fifty five  who was incapable of running twenty paces  but  as he had been born at bayonne  m  gillenormand called him basque  all the female servants in his house were called nicolette even the magnon  of whom we shall hear more farther on  one day  a haughty cook  a cordon bleu  of the lofty race of porters  presented herself how much wages do you want a month  asked m  gillenormand  thirty francs  what is your name  olympie  you shall have fifty francs and you shall be called nicolette chapter vi in which magnon and her two children are seen with m  gillenormand  sorrow was converted into wrath  he was furious at being in despair  he had all sorts of prejudices and took all sorts of liberties  one of the facts of which his exterior relief and his internal satisfaction was composed  was  as we have just hinted  that he had remained a brisk spark  and that he passed energetically for such this he called having royal renown  this royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls  one day  there was brought to him in a basket  as though it had been a basket of oysters  a stout  newly born boy  who was yelling like the deuce  and duly wrapped in swaddling clothes  which a servant maid  dismissed six months previously  attributed to him  m  gillenormand had  at that time fully completed his eighty fourth year  indignation and uproar in the establishment  and whom did that bold hussy think she could persuade to believe that  what audacity  what an abominable calumny  m  gillenormand himself was not at all enraged  he gazed at the brat with the amiable smile of a good man who is flattered by the calumny  and said in an aside  well  what now  what s the matter  you are finely taken aback and really  you are excessively ignorant  m  le duc d angouleme  the bastard of his majesty charles ix  married a silly jade of fifteen when he was eighty five  m  virginal  marquis d alluye  brother to the cardinal de sourdis  archbishop of bordeaux  had  at the age of eighty three  by the maid of madame la presidente jacquin  a son  a real child of love  who became a chevalier of malta and a counsellor of state  one of the great men of this century  the abbe tabaraud  is the son of a man of eighty seven  there is nothing out of the ordinary in these things  and then  the bible  upon that i declare that this little gentleman is none of mine  let him be taken care of  it is not his fault  this manner of procedure was good tempered  the woman  whose name was magnon  sent him another parcel in the following year  it was a boy again  thereupon  m  gillenormand capitulated  he sent the two brats back to their mother  promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance  on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more  he added  i insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well i shall go to see them from time to time  and this he did  he had had a brother who was a priest  and who had been rector of the academy of poitiers for three and thirty years  and had died at seventy nine i lost him young  said he  this brother  of whom but little memory remains  was a peaceable miser  who  being a priest  thought himself bound to bestow alms on the poor whom he met  but he never gave them anything except bad or demonetized sous  thereby discovering a means of going to hell by way of paradise  as for m  gillenormand the elder  he never haggled over his alms giving  but gave gladly and nobly  he was kindly  abrupt  charitable  and if he had been rich  his turn of mind would have been magnificent  he desired that all which concerned him should be done in a grand manner  even his rogueries  one day  having been cheated by a business man in a matter of inheritance  in a gross and apparent manner  he uttered this solemn exclamation  that was indecently done  i am really ashamed of this pilfering  everything has degenerated in this century  even the rascals  morbleu  this is not the way to rob a man of my standing  i am robbed as though in a forest  but badly robbed  silva  sint consule dignae  he had had two wives  as we have already mentioned  by the first he had had a daughter  who had remained unmarried  and by the second another daughter  who had died at about the age of thirty  who had wedded  through love  or chance or otherwise  a soldier of fortune who had served in the armies of the republic and of the empire  who had won the cross at austerlitz and had been made colonel at waterloo  he is the disgrace of my family said the old bourgeois  he took an immense amount of snuff  and had a particularly graceful manner of plucking at his lace ruffle with the back of one hand  he believed very little in god chapter vii rule  receive no one except in the evening such was m  luc esprit gillenormand  who had not lost his hair which was gray rather than white and which was always dressed in dog s ears  to sum up  he was venerable in spite of all this he had something of the eighteenth century about him  frivolous and great in  and during the early years of the restoration  m  gillenormand who was still young he was only seventy four lived in the faubourg saint germain  rue servandoni  near saint sulpice  he had only retired to the marais when he quitted society  long after attaining the age of eighty and  on abandoning society  he had immured himself in his habits  the principal one  and that which was invariable  was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day  and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening  he dined at five o clock  and after that his door was open  that had been the fashion of his century  and he would not swerve from it  the day is vulgar  said he  and deserves only a closed shutter  fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars  and he barricaded himself against every one  even had it been the king himself  this was the antiquated elegance of his day chapter viii two do not make a pair we have just spoken of m  gillenormand s two daughters  they had come into the world ten years apart  in their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other  either in character or countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible  the youngest had a charming soul  which turned towards all that belongs to the light  was occupied with flowers  with verses  with music  which fluttered away into glorious space  enthusiastic  ethereal  and was wedded from her very youth  in ideal  to a vague and heroic figure  the elder had also her chimera  she espied in the azure some very wealthy purveyor  a contractor  a splendidly stupid husband  a million made man or even a prefect  the receptions of the prefecture  an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck  official balls  the harangues of the town hall  to be madame la prefete all this had created a whirlwind in her imagination  thus the two sisters strayed  each in her own dream  at the epoch when they were young girls  both had wings  the one like an angel  the other like a goose no ambition is ever fully realized  here below at least  no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day  the younger wedded the man of her dreams  but she died  the elder did not marry at all at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating  she was an antique virtue  an incombustible prude  with one of the sharpest noses  and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see  a characteristic detail  outside of her immediate family  no one had ever known her first name  she was called mademoiselle gillenormand the elder in the matter of cant  mademoiselle gillenormand could have given points to a miss  her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness she cherished a frightful memory of her life  one day  a man had beheld her garter age had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty  her guimpe was never sufficiently opaque  and never ascended sufficiently high  she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced nevertheless  let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence  she allowed an officer of the lancers  her grand nephew named theodule  to embrace her without displeasure in spite of this favored lancer  the label  prude  under which we have classed her  suited her to absolute perfection  mademoiselle gillenormand was a sort of twilight soul  prudery is a demi virtue and a demi vice to prudery she added bigotry  a well assorted lining  she belonged to the society of the virgin  wore a white veil on certain festivals mumbled special orisons  revered the holy blood  venerated the sacred heart  remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful and there allowed her soul to soar among little clouds of marble  and through great rays of gilded wood she had a chapel friend  an ancient virgin like herself  named mademoiselle vaubois  who was a positive blockhead  and beside whom mademoiselle gillenormand had the pleasure of being an eagle  beyond the agnus dei and ave maria  mademoiselle vaubois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves  mademoiselle vaubois  perfect in her style  was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence let us say it plainly  mademoiselle gillenormand had gained rather than lost as she grew older  this is the case with passive natures  she had never been malicious  which is relative kindness  and then  years wear away the angles  and the softening which comes with time had come to her  she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret  there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished  and which had never had a beginning she kept house for her father  m  gillenormand had his daughter near him  as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are not rare  and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support there was also in this house  between this elderly spinster and this old man  a child  a little boy  who was always trembling and mute in the presence of m  gillenormand  m  gillenormand never addressed this child except in a severe voice  and sometimes  with uplifted cane  here  sir rascal  scoundrel  come here answer me  you scamp  just let me see you  you good for nothing  etc  etc  he idolized him this was his grandson  we shall meet with this child again later on book third the grandfather and the grandson chapter i an ancient salon when m  gillenormand lived in the rue servandoni  he had frequented many very good and very aristocratic salons  although a bourgeois  m gillenormand was received in society  as he had a double measure of wit in the first place  that which was born with him  and secondly  that which was attributed to him  he was even sought out and made much of  he never went anywhere except on condition of being the chief person there there are people who will have influence at any price  and who will have other people busy themselves over them  when they cannot be oracles they turn wags  m  gillenormand was not of this nature  his domination in the royalist salons which he frequented cost his self respect nothing  he was an oracle everywhere  it had happened to him to hold his own against m  de bonald  and even against m  bengy puy vallee about  he invariably passed two afternoons a week in a house in his own neighborhood  in the rue ferou  with madame la baronne de t a worthy and respectable person  whose husband had been ambassador of france to berlin under louis xvi  baron de t  who  during his lifetime had gone very passionately into ecstasies and magnetic visions  had died bankrupt  during the emigration  leaving  as his entire fortune some very curious memoirs about mesmer and his tub  in ten manuscript volumes  bound in red morocco and gilded on the edges  madame de t  had not published the memoirs  out of pride  and maintained herself on a meagre income which had survived no one knew how madame de t  lived far from the court  a very mixed society  as she said  in a noble isolation  proud and poor  a few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth  and these constituted a purely royalist salon  they sipped tea there  and uttered groans or cries of horror at the century  the charter  the bonapartists  the prostitution of the blue ribbon  or the jacobinism of louis xviii  according as the wind veered towards elegy or dithyrambs  and they spoke in low tones of the hopes which were presented by monsieur  afterwards charles x the songs of the fishwomen  in which napoleon was called nicolas  were received there with transports of joy  duchesses  the most delicate and charming women in the world  went into ecstasies over couplets like the following  addressed to the federates                refoncez dans vos culottes                le bout d  chemis  qui vous pend                qu on n  dis  pas qu  les patriotes                ont arbore l  drapeau blanc there they amused themselves with puns which were considered terrible with innocent plays upon words which they supposed to be venomous  with quatrains  with distiches even  thus  upon the dessolles ministry  a moderate cabinet  of which mm  decazes and deserre were members           pour raffermir le trone ebranle sur sa base           il faut changer de sol  et de serre et de case or they drew up a list of the chamber of peers  an abominably jacobin chamber  and from this list they combined alliances of names  in such a manner as to form  for example  phrases like the following  damas sabran  gouvion saint cyr all this was done merrily  in that society they parodied the revolution  they used i know not what desires to give point to the same wrath in inverse sense  they sang their little ca ira                ah  ca ira ca ira ca ira                les bonapartistes a la lanterne songs are like the guillotine  they chop away indifferently  to day this head  to morrow that  it is only a variation in the fualdes affair  which belongs to this epoch   they took part for bastide and jausion  because fualdes was a buonapartist  they designated the liberals as friends and brothers  this constituted the most deadly insult like certain church towers  madame de t s salon had two cocks  one of them was m  gillenormand  the other was comte de lamothe valois  of whom it was whispered about  with a sort of respect  do you know  that is the lamothe of the affair of the necklace  these singular amnesties do occur in parties let us add the following  in the bourgeoisie  honored situations decay through too easy relations  one must beware whom one admits  in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold  there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons  the ancient society of the upper classes held themselves above this law  as above every other  marigny  the brother of the pompadour had his entry with m  le prince de soubise  in spite of  no  because  du barry  the god father of the vaubernier  was very welcome at the house of m  le marechal de richelieu  this society is olympus  mercury and the prince de guemenee are at home there  a thief is admitted there provided he be a god the comte de lamothe  who  in  was an old man seventy five years of age  had nothing remarkable about him except his silent and sententious air  his cold and angular face  his perfectly polished manners  his coat buttoned up to his cravat  and his long legs always crossed in long flabby trousers of the hue of burnt sienna  his face was the same color as his trousers this m  de lamothe was held in consideration  in this salon on account of his celebrity  and  strange to say  though true  because of his name of valois as for m  gillenormand  his consideration was of absolutely first rate quality  he had  in spite of his levity  and without its interfering in any way with his dignity  a certain manner about him which was imposing dignified  honest  and lofty  in a bourgeois fashion  and his great age added to it  one is not a century with impunity  the years finally produce around a head a venerable dishevelment in addition to this  he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock  thus  when the king of prussia  after having restored louis xviii  came to pay the latter a visit under the name of the count de ruppin  he was received by the descendant of louis xiv  somewhat as though he had been the marquis de brandebourg  and with the most delicate impertinence  m  gillenormand approved  all kings who are not the king of france  said he  are provincial kings  one day  the following question was put and the following answer returned in his presence  to what was the editor of the courrier francais condemned to be suspended  sus is superfluous  observed m  gillenormand remarks of this nature found a situation at the te deum on the anniversary of the return of the bourbons  he said  on seeing m  de talleyrand pass by  there goes his excellency the evil one m  gillenormand was always accompanied by his daughter  that tall mademoiselle  who was over forty and looked fifty  and by a handsome little boy of seven years  white  rosy  fresh  with happy and trusting eyes  who never appeared in that salon without hearing voices murmur around him  how handsome he is  what a pity  poor child  this child was the one of whom we dropped a word a while ago  he was called poor child  because he had for a father a brigand of the loire this brigand of the loire was m  gillenormand s son in law  who has already been mentioned  and whom m  gillenormand called the disgrace of his family chapter ii one of the red spectres of that epoch any one who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch  and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge  which will soon be succeeded  let us hope  by some hideous iron cable bridge  might have observed  had he dropped his eyes over the parapet  a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap  and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth  to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon  was sewn  shod with wooden sabots  tanned by the sun  his face nearly black and his hair nearly white  a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek  bowed  bent prematurely aged  who walked nearly every day  hoe and sickle in hand in one of those compartments surrounded by walls which abut on the bridge  and border the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say  were they much larger  these are gardens  and were they a little smaller  these are bouquets  all these enclosures abut upon the river at one end  and on a house at the other  the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken  inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about  he lived there alone and solitary  silently and poorly  with a woman who was neither young nor old  neither homely nor pretty  neither a peasant nor a bourgeoise  who served him  the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there these flowers were his occupation by dint of labor  of perseverance  of attention  and of buckets of water  he had succeeded in creating after the creator  and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature  he was ingenious  he had forestalled soulange bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould  for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china  he was in his alleys from the break of day  in summer  planting  cutting hoeing  watering  walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness  and sweetness  sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours  listening to the song of a bird in the trees  the babble of a child in a house  or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the tip of a spear of grass  of which the sun made a carbuncle  his table was very plain  and he drank more milk than wine  a child could make him give way  and his servant scolded him  he was so timid that he seemed shy  he rarely went out  and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped at his pane and his cure  the abbe mabeuf  a good old man  nevertheless  if the inhabitants of the town  or strangers  or any chance comers  curious to see his tulips  rang at his little cottage  he opened his door with a smile  he was the brigand of the loire any one who had  at the same time  read military memoirs  biographies the moniteur  and the bulletins of the grand army  would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency  the name of georges pontmercy  when very young  this georges pontmercy had been a soldier in saintonge s regiment  the revolution broke out  saintonge s regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine  for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy  and were only divided into brigades in  pontmercy fought at spire  at worms  at neustadt  at turkheim  at alzey  at mayence  where he was one of the two hundred who formed houchard s rearguard  it was the twelfth to hold its ground against the corps of the prince of hesse  behind the old rampart of andernach  and only rejoined the main body of the army when the enemy s cannon had opened a breach from the cord of the parapet to the foot of the glacis  he was under kleber at marchiennes and at the battle of mont palissel  where a ball from a biscaien broke his arm  then he passed to the frontier of italy  and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the col de tende with joubert  joubert was appointed its adjutant general  and pontmercy sub lieutenant  pontmercy was by berthier s side in the midst of the grape shot of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say berthier has been cannoneer  cavalier  and grenadier  he beheld his old general  joubert  fall at novi  at the moment when  with uplifted sabre  he was shouting  forward  having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign  on board a pinnace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast  he fell into a wasps nest of seven or eight english vessels  the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea  to hide the soldiers between decks  and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel  pontmercy had the colors hoisted to the peak  and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates  twenty leagues further on  his audacity having increased  he attacked with his pinnace  and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily  and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea  in  he was in that malher division which took gunzberg from the archduke ferdinand  at weltingen he received into his arms  beneath a storm of bullets  colonel maupetit  mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons  he distinguished himself at austerlitz in that admirable march in echelons effected under the enemy s fire  when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pontmercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard  the emperor gave him the cross  pontmercy saw wurmser at mantua melas  and alexandria  mack at ulm  made prisoners in succession he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded  and which captured hamburg  then he was transferred to the th of the line  which was the old regiment of flanders  at eylau he was in the cemetery where  for the space of two hours  the heroic captain louis hugo  the uncle of the author of this book  sustained alone with his company of eighty three men every effort of the hostile army  pontmercy was one of the three who emerged alive from that cemetery  he was at friedland  then he saw moscow  then la beresina then lutzen  bautzen  dresden  wachau  leipzig  and the defiles of gelenhausen  then montmirail  chateau thierry  craon  the banks of the marne  the banks of the aisne  and the redoubtable position of laon  at arnay le duc  being then a captain  he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved  not his general  but his corporal  he was well slashed up on this occasion  and twenty seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone  eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry  he had what was called under the old regime  the double hand  that is to say  an equal aptitude for handling the sabre or the musket as a soldier  or a squadron or a battalion as an officer  it is from this aptitude  perfected by a military education  which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons  for example  who are both cavalry men and infantry at one and the same time  he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba  at waterloo  he was chief of a squadron of cuirassiers  in dubois  brigade it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion  he came and cast the flag at the emperor s feet  he was covered with blood while tearing down the banner he had received a sword cut across his face  the emperor  greatly pleased  shouted to him  you are a colonel you are a baron  you are an officer of the legion of honor  pontmercy replied  sire  i thank you for my widow  an hour later  he fell in the ravine of ohain  now  who was this georges pontmercy  he was this same brigand of the loire we have already seen something of his history  after waterloo pontmercy  who had been pulled out of the hollow road of ohain  as it will be remembered  had succeeded in joining the army  and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire the restoration had placed him on half pay  then had sent him into residence  that is to say  under surveillance  at vernon  king louis xviii  regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all  did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor  nor his grade of colonel  nor his title of baron  he  on his side  neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pontmercy  he had only an old blue coat  and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor  the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal  wearing of this decoration  when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary  pontmercy retorted with a bitter smile  i do not know whether i no longer understand french  or whether you no longer speak it  but the fact is that i do not understand  then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette  they dared not interfere with him  two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address  a monsieur le commandant pontmercy he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken  at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte  pontmercy had ended may we be pardoned the expression  by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor in the same way  there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute flaminius  and who had a little of hannibal s spirit one day he encountered the district attorney in one of the streets of vernon  stepped up to him  and said  mr  crown attorney  am i permitted to wear my scar he had nothing save his meagre half pay as chief of squadron  he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon  he lived there alone  we have just seen how  under the empire  between two wars  he had found time to marry mademoiselle gillenormand  the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom  had given his consent with a sigh saying  the greatest families are forced into it  in  madame pontmercy  an admirable woman in every sense  by the way  lofty in sentiment and rare  and worthy of her husband  died  leaving a child  this child had been the colonel s joy in his solitude  but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson  declaring that if the child were not given to him he would disinherit him  the father had yielded in the little one s interest  and had transferred his love to flowers moreover  he had renounced everything  and neither stirred up mischief nor conspired  he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done  he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz m  gillenormand kept up no relations with his son in law  the colonel was a bandit  to him  m  gillenormand never mentioned the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baronship it had been expressly agreed that pontmercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him  under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited  for the gillenormands  pontmercy was a man afflicted with the plague  they intended to bring up the child in their own way  perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions  but he submitted to them  thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself the inheritance of father gillenormand did not amount to much  but the inheritance of mademoiselle gillenormand the elder was considerable this aunt  who had remained unmarried  was very rich on the maternal side  and her sister s son was her natural heir  the boy  whose name was marius  knew that he had a father  but nothing more  no one opened his mouth to him about it  nevertheless  in the society into which his grandfather took him  whispers  innuendoes  and winks  had eventually enlightened the little boy s mind  he had finally understood something of the case  and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were  so to speak  the air he breathed  by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration  he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart while he was growing up in this fashion  the colonel slipped away every two or three months  came to paris on the sly  like a criminal breaking his ban  and went and posted himself at saint sulpice  at the hour when aunt gillenormand led marius to the mass  there  trembling lest the aunt should turn round  concealed behind a pillar  motionless  not daring to breathe  he gazed at his child  the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon  m  l abbe mabeuf that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of saint sulpice  who had often observed this man gazing at his child  and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes  that man  who had so manly an air  yet who was weeping like a woman  had struck the warden  that face had clung to his mind  one day  having gone to vernon to see his brother  he had encountered colonel pontmercy on the bridge  and had recognized the man of saint sulpice  the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit  on some pretext or other  this visit led to others  the colonel  who had been extremely reserved at first  ended by opening his heart  and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history  and how pontmercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child s future  this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness  and the colonel  on his side  became fond of the cure  and moreover  when both are sincere and good  no men so penetrate each other  and so amalgamate with each other  as an old priest and an old soldier  at bottom  the man is the same  the one has devoted his life to his country here below  the other to his country on high  that is the only difference twice a year  on the first of january and on st  george s day  marius wrote duty letters to his father  which were dictated by his aunt  and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula  this was all that m  gillenormand tolerated  and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread chapter iii requiescant madame de t s salon was all that marius pontmercy knew of the world  it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life  this opening was sombre  and more cold than warmth  more night than day  came to him through this skylight  this child  who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world  soon became melancholy  and  what is still more contrary to his age  grave  surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages  he gazed about him with serious amazement everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him  there were in madame de t s salon some very noble ladies named mathan  noe levis which was pronounced levi cambis  pronounced cambyse  these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the child s mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart  and when they were all there  seated in a circle around a dying fire  sparely lighted by a lamp shaded with green  with their severe profiles  their gray or white hair  their long gowns of another age  whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished  dropping  at rare intervals  words which were both majestic and severe  little marius stared at them with frightened eyes  in the conviction that he beheld not women  but patriarchs and magi  not real beings  but phantoms with these phantoms  priests were sometimes mingled  frequenters of this ancient salon  and some gentlemen  the marquis de sass  private secretary to madame de berry  the vicomte de val  who published under the pseudonyme of charles antoine  monorhymed odes  the prince de beauff  who  though very young  had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife  whose very low necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold torsades alarmed these shadows  the marquis de c d e  the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness  the comte d am  the kindly man with the amiable chin  and the chevalier de port de guy  a pillar of the library of the louvre  called the king s cabinet  m  de port de guy  bald  and rather aged than old  was wont to relate that in  at the age of sixteen  he had been put in the galleys as refractory and chained with an octogenarian  the bishop of mirepoix  also refractory  but as a priest  while he was so in the capacity of a soldier  this was at toulon  their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day  they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses  and their red galley slave blouses had a clot of blood at the back of the neck  which was dry in the morning and wet at night  these tragic tales abounded in madame de t s salon  and by dint of cursing marat  they applauded trestaillon  some deputies of the undiscoverable variety played their whist there  m  thibord du chalard m  lemarchant de gomicourt  and the celebrated scoffer of the right  m cornet dincourt  the bailiff de ferrette  with his short breeches and his thin legs  sometimes traversed this salon on his way to m  de talleyrand  he had been m  le comte d artois  companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe  he had made the guimard crawl on all fours  and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff  as for the priests  there was the abbe halma  the same to whom m  larose  his collaborator on la foudre  said  bah  who is there who is not fifty years old  a few greenhorns perhaps  the abbe letourneur  preacher to the king  the abbe frayssinous  who was not  as yet  either count  or bishop  or minister  or peer  and who wore an old cassock whose buttons were missing  and the abbe keravenant  cure of saint germain des pres  also the pope s nuncio  then monsignor macchi archbishop of nisibi  later on cardinal  remarkable for his long pensive nose  and another monsignor  entitled thus  abbate palmieri domestic prelate  one of the seven participant prothonotaries of the holy see  canon of the illustrious liberian basilica  advocate of the saints  postulatore dei santi  which refers to matters of canonization and signifies very nearly  master of requests of the section of paradise  lastly  two cardinals  m  de la luzerne  and m  de cl t  the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later  the honor of signing in the conservateur articles side by side with chateaubriand  m  de cl  t  was archbishop of toul  and often made trips to paris  to his nephew  the marquis de t  who was minister of marine and war  the cardinal of cl  t  was a merry little man  who displayed his red stockings beneath his tucked up cassock  his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia  and his desperate play at billiards  and persons who at that epoch  passed through the rue m  on summer evenings  where the hotel de cl  t  then stood  halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his conclavist  monseigneur cotiret  bishop in partibus of caryste  mark abbe  i make a cannon  the cardinal de cl  t  had been brought to madame de t s by his most intimate friend  m  de roquelaure former bishop of senlis  and one of the forty  m  de roquelaure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy  through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings  the curious could  on every tuesday contemplate the ex bishop of senlis  usually standing erect  freshly powdered  in violet hose  with his back turned to the door  apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar  all these ecclesiastics  though for the most part as much courtiers as churchmen  added to the gravity of the t  salon  whose seigniorial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france  the marquis de vib the marquis de tal  the marquis de herb  the vicomte damb and the duc de val  this duc de val  although prince de mon  that is to say a reigning prince abroad  had so high an idea of france and its peerage  that he viewed everything through their medium it was he who said  the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england  moreover  as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was  as we have said  dominated by a bourgeois  m gillenormand reigned there there lay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society there reputations  even royalist reputations  were held in quarantine there is always a trace of anarchy in renown  chateaubriand  had he entered there  would have produced the effect of pere duchene  some of the scoffed at did  nevertheless  penetrate thither on sufferance  comte beug  was received there  subject to correction the noble  salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons the faubourg saint germain reeks of the fagot even now  the royalists of to day are demagogues  let us record it to their credit at madame de t s the society was superior  taste was exquisite and haughty  under the cover of a great show of politeness  manners there admitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself  buried but still alive  some of these habits  especially in the matter of language  seem eccentric  persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique  a woman was called madame la generale  madame la colonelle was not entirely disused  the charming madame de leon  in memory  no doubt  of the duchesses de longueville and de chevreuse  preferred this appellation to her title of princesse  the marquise de crequy was also called madame la colonelle it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king  in the third person  and never as your majesty  the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper men and deeds were brought to judgment there  they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it  they abetted each other in amazement  they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed  methuselah bestowed information on epimenides  the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things  they declared that the time which had elasped since coblentz had not existed  in the same manner that louis xviii  was by the grace of god  in the five and twentieth year of his reign  the emigrants were by rights  in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence all was harmonious  nothing was too much alive  speech hardly amounted to a breath  the newspapers  agreeing with the salons  seemed a papyrus there were some young people  but they were rather dead  the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated  these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp they all had the air of having lived a long time ago  and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre  nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserver  conservation  conservateur  to be in good odor that was the point  there are  in fact  aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups  and their ideas smelled of it  it was a mummified society  the masters were embalmed  the servants were stuffed with straw a worthy old marquise  an emigree and ruined  who had but a solitary maid  continued to say  my people what did they do in madame de t s salon  they were ultra to be ultra  this word  although what it represents may not have disappeared  has no longer any meaning at the present day  let us explain it to be ultra is to go beyond  it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne  and the mitre in the name of the attar  it is to ill treat the thing which one is dragging  it is to kick over the traces  it is to cavil at the fagot on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics  it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect  it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papish  that the king is not sufficiently royal  and that the night has too much light  it is to be discontented with alabaster  with snow  with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness  it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy  it is to be so strongly for  as to be against the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in  and terminates about  with the advent of m  de villele the practical man of the right  these six years were an extraordinary moment  at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy  smiling and sombre  illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered  at the same time  with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past  there existed in that light and that shadow  a complete little new and old world comic and sad  juvenile and senile  which was rubbing its eyes  nothing resembles an awakening like a return  a group which regarded france with ill temper  and which france regarded with irony  good old owls of marquises by the streetful  who had returned  and of ghosts  the former  subjects of amazement at everything  brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also  delighted to behold their country once more  in despair at not finding their monarchy  the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire  that is to say  the nobility of the sword  with scorn  historic races who had lost the sense of history  the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon  the swords  as we have just remarked  returned the insult  the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty iron  the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre  former days did not recognize yesterday  people no longer had the feeling for what was grand  there was some one who called bonaparte scapin  this society no longer exists  nothing of it  we repeat  exists to day  when we select from it some one figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought  it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge  it is because it  too  as a matter of fact  has been engulfed in a deluge  it has disappeared beneath two revolutions  what billows are ideas  how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury  and how promptly they create frightful gulfs such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m  martainville had more wit than voltaire these salons had a literature and politics of their own  they believed in fievee  m  agier laid down the law in them  they commentated m colnet  the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malaquais  napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre  later on the introduction into history of m  le marquis de bonaparte  lieutenant general of the king s armies  was a concession to the spirit of the age these salons did not long preserve their purity  beginning with doctrinarians began to spring up in them  a disturbing shade  their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so  where the ultras were very proud  the doctrinarians were rather ashamed  they had wit  they had silence  their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance  they should have succeeded  they indulged  and usefully too  in excesses in the matter of white neckties and tightly buttoned coats  the mistake or the misfortune of the doctrinarian party was to create aged youth  they assumed the poses of wise men  they dreamed of engrafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle they opposed  and sometimes with rare intelligence  conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolishes  they were heard to say thanks for royalism  it has rendered more than one service  it has brought back tradition  worship  religion  respect  it is faithful brave  chivalric  loving  devoted  it has mingled  though with regret the secular grandeurs of the monarchy with the new grandeurs of the nation  its mistake is not to understand the revolution  the empire glory  liberty  young ideas  young generations  the age  but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them  the revolution  whose heirs we are  ought to be intelligent on all points  to attack royalism is a misconstruction of liberalism  what an error  and what blindness  revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france  that is to say  towards its mother  that is to say  towards itself  after the th of september  the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july  they were unjust to the eagle  we are unjust to the fleur de lys  it seems that we must always have something to proscribe  does it serve any purpose to ungild the crown of louis xiv  to scrape the coat of arms of henry iv  we scoff at m  de vaublanc for erasing the n s from the bridge of jena  what was it that he did  what are we doing  bouvines belongs to us as well as marengo the fleurs de lys are ours as well as the n s  that is our patrimony  to what purpose shall we diminish it  we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present  why not accept the whole of history why not love the whole of france it is thus that doctrinarians criticised and protected royalism  which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection the ultras marked the first epoch of royalism  congregation characterized the second  skill follows ardor  let us confine ourselves here to this sketch in the course of this narrative  the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history  he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it  and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown to day  but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea  souvenirs both respectful and affectionate  for they touch his mother  attach him to this past  moreover  let us remark  this same petty world had a grandeur of its own  one may smile at it  but one can neither despise nor hate it  it was the france of former days marius pontmercy pursued some studies  as all children do  when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillenormand  his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence  this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant marius went through his years of college  then he entered the law school  he was a royalist  fanatical and severe  he did not love his grandfather much  as the latter s gayety and cynicism repelled him  and his feelings towards his father were gloomy he was  on the whole  a cold and ardent  noble  generous  proud religious  enthusiastic lad  dignified to harshness  pure to shyness chapter iv end of the brigand the conclusion of marius  classical studies coincided with m gillenormand s departure from society  the old man bade farewell to the faubourg saint germain and to madame de t s salon  and established himself in the mardis  in his house of the rue des filles du calvaire there he had for servants  in addition to the porter  that chambermaid nicolette  who had succeeded to magnon  and that short breathed and pursy basque  who have been mentioned above in  marius had just attained his seventeenth year  one evening  on his return home  he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand marius  said m  gillenormand  you will set out for vernon to morrow why  said marius to see your father marius was seized with a trembling fit  he had thought of everything except this that he should one day be called upon to see his father nothing could be more unexpected  more surprising  and  let us admit it  more disagreeable to him  it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation  it was not an affliction  but it was an unpleasant duty marius  in addition to his motives of political antipathy  was convinced that his father  the slasher  as m  gillenormand called him on his amiable days  did not love him  this was evident  since he had abandoned him to others  feeling that he was not beloved  he did not love nothing is more simple  he said to himself he was so astounded that he did not question m  gillenormand  the grandfather resumed it appears that he is ill  he demands your presence and after a pause  he added set out to morrow morning  i think there is a coach which leaves the cour des fontaines at six o clock  and which arrives in the evening take it  he says that here is haste then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning  a diligence from the rue du bouloi took the trip to rouen by night at that date  and passed through vernon neither marius nor m  gillenormand thought of making inquiries about it the next day  at twilight  marius reached vernon  people were just beginning to light their candles  he asked the first person whom he met for m  pontmercy s house  for in his own mind  he agreed with the restoration  and like it  did not recognize his father s claim to the title of either colonel or baron the house was pointed out to him  he rang  a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door m  pontmercy  said marius the woman remained motionless is this his house  demanded marius the woman nodded affirmatively can i speak with him the woman shook her head but i am his son  persisted marius  he is expecting me he no longer expects you  said the woman then he perceived that she was weeping she pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor  he entered in that room  which was lighted by a tallow candle standing on the chimney piece  there were three men  one standing erect  another kneeling  and one lying at full length  on the floor in his shirt  the one on the floor was the colonel the other two were the doctor  and the priest  who was engaged in prayer the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously  as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness  he had written to m  gillenormand to demand his son  the malady had grown worse  on the very evening of marius  arrival at vernon  the colonel had had an attack of delirium  he had risen from his bed  in spite of the servant s efforts to prevent him  crying  my son is not coming  i shall go to meet him  then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber  he had just expired the doctor had been summoned  and the cure  the doctor had arrived too late  the son had also arrived too late by the dim light of the candle  a large tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel s cheek  where it had trickled from his dead eye  the eye was extinguished  but the tear was not yet dry  that tear was his son s delay marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time  on that venerable and manly face  on those open eyes which saw not  on those white locks  those robust limbs  on which  here and there  brown lines  marking sword thrusts  and a sort of red stars  which indicated bullet holes  were visible  he contemplated that gigantic sear which stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness  he reflected that this man was his father  and that this man was dead  and a chill ran over him the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chanced to behold stretched out in death anguish  poignant anguish  was in that chamber  the servant woman was lamenting in a corner  the cure was praying  and his sobs were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes  the corpse itself was weeping the doctor  the priest  and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word  he was the stranger there marius  who was far too little affected  felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude  he held his hat in his hand  and he dropped it on the floor  in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it at the same time  he experienced remorse  and he despised himself for behaving in this manner  but was it his fault  he did not love his father  why should he the colonel had left nothing  the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial the servant found a scrap of paper  which she handed to marius  it contained the following  in the colonel s handwriting for my son the emperor made me a baron on the battle field of waterloo  since the res
