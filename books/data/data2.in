enry bannerworth  in expectation of a communication which his fears told him was to blast all his dearest and most fondly cherished hopes for ever would scarce have recognised in him the same young man who  one short hour before  had knocked so loudly  and so full of joyful hope and expectation  at the door of the hall but so it was  he knew henry bannerworth too well to suppose that any unreal cause could blanch his cheek  he knew flora too well to imagine for one moment that caprice had dictated the  to him  fearful words of dismissal she had uttered to him happier would it at that time have been for charles holland had she acted capriciously towards him  and convinced him that his true heart s devotion had been cast at the feet of one unworthy of so really noble a gift  pride would then have enabled him  no doubt  successfully to resist the blow  a feeling of honest and proper indignation at having his feelings trifled with  would  no doubt  have sustained him  but alas  the case seemed widely different true  she implored him to think of her no more no longer to cherish in his breast the fond dream of affection which had been its guest so long but the manner in which she did so brought along with it an irresistible conviction  that she was making a noble sacrifice of her own feelings for him  from some cause which was involved in the profoundest mystery but now he was to hear all  henry had promised to tell him  and as he looked into his pale  but handsomely intellectual face  he half dreaded the disclosure he yet panted to hear tell me all  henry tell me all  he said  upon the words that come from your lips i know i can rely i will have no reservations with you  said henry  sadly  you ought to know all  and you shall  prepare yourself for the strangest revelation you ever heard indeed ay  one which in hearing you may well doubt  and one which  i hope  you will never find an opportunity of verifying you speak in riddles and yet speak truly  charles  you heard with what a frantic vehemence flora desired you to think no more of her i did i did she was right  she is a noble hearted girl for uttering those words  a dreadful incident in our family has occurred  which might well induce you to pause before uniting your fate with that of any member of it impossible  nothing can possibly subdue the feelings of affection i entertain for flora  she is worthy of any one  and  as such  amid all changes all mutations of fortune  she shall be mine do not suppose that any change of fortune has produced the scene you were witness to then  what else i will tell you  holland  in all your travels  and in all your reading did you ever come across anything about vampyres about what  cried charles  drawing his chair forward a little  about what you may well doubt the evidence of your own ears  charles holland  and wish me to repeat what i said  i say  do you know anything about vampyres charles holland looked curiously in henry s face  and the latter immediately added i can guess what is passing in your mind at present  and i do not wonder at it  you think i must be mad well  really  henry  your extraordinary question i knew it  were i you  i should hesitate to believe the tale  but the fact is  we have every reason to believe that one member of our own family is one of those horrible preternatural beings called vampyres good god  henry  can you allow your judgment for a moment to stoop to such a supposition that is what i have asked myself a hundred times  but  charles holland the judgment  the feelings  and all the prejudices  natural and acquired  must succumb to actual ocular demonstration  listen to me  and do not interrupt me  you shall know all  and you shall know it circumstantially henry then related to the astonished charles holland all that had occurred  from the first alarm of flora  up to that period when he holland  caught her in his arms as she was about to leave the room and now  he said  in conclusion  i cannot tell what opinion you may come to as regards these most singular events  you will recollect that here is the unbiassed evidence of four or five people to the facts  and beyond that  the servants  who have seen something of the horrible visitor you bewilder me  utterly  said charles holland as we are all bewildered but but  gracious heaven  it cannot be it is no no  there is there must be yet some dreadful mistake can you start any supposition by which we can otherwise explain any of the phenomena i have described to you  if you can  for heaven s sake do so  and you will find no one who will cling to it with more tenacity than i any other species or kind of supernatural appearance might admit of argument  but this  to my perception  is too wildly improbable too much at variance with all we see and know of the operations of nature it is so  all that we have told ourselves repeatedly  and yet is all human reason at once struck down by the few brief words of we have seen it i would doubt my eyesight one might  but many cannot be labouring under the same delusion my friend  i pray you  do not make me shudder at the supposition that such a dreadful thing as this is at all possible i  am  believe me  charles  most unwilling to oppress anyone with the knowledge of these evils  but you are so situated with us  that you ought to know  and you will clearly understand that you may  with perfect honour  now consider yourself free from all engagements you have entered into with flora no  no  by heaven  no yes  charles  reflect upon the consequences now of a union with such a family oh  henry bannerworth  can you suppose me so dead to all good feeling so utterly lost to honourable impulses  as to eject from my heart her who has possession of it entirely  on such a ground as this you would be justified coldly justified in prudence i might be  there are a thousand circumstances in which a man may be justified in a particular course of action  and that course yet may be neither honourable nor just  i love flora  and were she tormented by the whole of the supernatural world  i should still love her  nay  it becomes  then  a higher and a nobler duty on my part to stand between her and those evils  if possible charles charles  said henry  i cannot of course refuse to you my meed of praise and admiration for your generosity of feeling  but remember  if we are compelled  despite all our feelings and all our predilections to the contrary  to give in to a belief in the existence of vampyres  why may we not at once receive as the truth all that is recorded of them to what do you allude to this  that one who has been visited by a vampyre  and whose blood has formed a horrible repast for such a being  becomes  after death  one of the dreadful race  and visits others in the same way now this must be insanity  cried charles it bears the aspect of it  indeed  said henry  oh  that you could by some means satisfy yourself that i am mad there may be insanity in this family  thought charles  with such an exquisite pang of misery  that he groaned aloud already  added henry  mournfully  already the blighting influence of the dreadful tale is upon you  charles  oh  let me add my advice to flora s entreaties  she loves you  and we all esteem you  fly  then from us  and leave us to encounter our miseries alone  fly from us charles holland  and take with you our best wishes for happiness which you cannot know here never  cried charles  i devote my existence to flora  i will not play the coward  and fly from one whom i love  on such grounds  i devote my life to her henry could not speak for emotion for several minutes  and when at length  in a faltering voice  he could utter some words  he said god of heaven  what happiness is marred by these horrible events  what have we all done to be the victims of such a dreadful act of vengeance henry  do not talk in that way  cried charles  rather let us bend all our energies to overcoming the evil  than spend any time in useless lamentations  i cannot even yet give in to a belief in the existence of such a being as you say visited flora but the evidences look you here  henry  until i am convinced that some things have happened which it is totally impossible could happen by any human means whatever  i will not ascribe them to supernatural influence but what human means  charles  could produce what i have now narrated to you i do not know  just at present  but i will give the subject the most attentive consideration  will you accommodate me here for a time you know you are as welcome here as if the house were your own  and all that it contains i believe so  most truly  you have no objection  i presume  to my conversing with flora upon this strange subject certainly not  of course you will be careful to say nothing which can add to her fears i shall be most guarded  believe me  you say that your brother george mr  chillingworth  yourself  and this mr  marchdale  have all been cognisant of the circumstances yes yes then with the whole of them you permit me to hold free communication upon the subject most certainly i will do so then  keep up good heart  henry  and this affair  which looks so full of terror at first sight  may yet be divested of some of its hideous aspect i am rejoiced  if anything can rejoice me now  said henry  to see you view the subject with so much philosophy why  said charles  you made a remark of your own  which enabled me viewing the matter in its very worst and most hideous aspect  to gather hope what was that you said  properly and naturally enough  that if ever we felt that there was such a weight of evidence in favour of a belief in the existence of vampyres that we are compelled to succumb to it  we might as well receive all the popular feelings and superstitions concerning them likewise i did  where is the mind to pause  when once we open it to the reception of such things well  then  if that be the case  we will watch this vampyre and catch it catch it yes  surely it can be caught  as i understand  this species of being is not like an apparition  that may be composed of thin air  and utterly impalpable to the human touch  but it consists of a revivified corpse yes  yes then it is tangible and destructible  by heaven  if ever i catch a glimpse of any such thing  it shall drag me to its home  be that where it may  or i will make it prisoner oh  charles  you know not the feeling of horror that will come across you when you do  you have no idea of how the warm blood will seem to curdle in your veins  and how you will be paralysed in every limb did you feel so i did i will endeavour to make head against such feelings  the love of flora shall enable me to vanquish them  think you it will come again to morrow illustration i can have no thought the one way or the other it may  we must arrange among us all  henry  some plan of watching which  without completely prostrating our health and strength  will always provide that one shall be up all night and on the alert it must be done flora ought to sleep with the consciousness now that she has ever at hand some intrepid and well armed protector  who is not only himself prepared to defend her  but who can in a moment give an alarm to us all in case of necessity requiring it it would be a dreadful capture to make to seize a vampyre  said henry not at all  it would be a very desirable one  being a corpse revivified  it is capable of complete destruction  so as to render it no longer a scourge to any one charles  charles  are you jesting with me  or do you really give any credence to the story my dear friend  i always make it a rule to take things at their worst and then i cannot be disappointed  i am content to reason upon this matter as if the fact of the existence of a vampyre were thoroughly established  and then to think upon what is best to be done about it you are right if it should turn out then that there is an error in the fact  well and good we are all the better off  but if otherwise  we are prepared  and armed at all points let it be so  then  it strikes me  charles  that you will be the coolest and the calmest among us all on this emergency  but the hour now waxes late  i will get them to prepare a chamber for you  and at least to night  after what has occurred already  i should think we can be under no apprehension probably not  but  henry  if you would allow me to sleep in that room where the portrait hangs of him whom you suppose to be the vampyre  i should prefer it prefer it yes  i am not one who courts danger for danger s sake  but i would rather occupy that room  to see if the vampyre  who perhaps has a partiality for it  will pay me a visit as you please  charles  you can have the apartment  it is in the same state as when occupied by flora  nothing has been  i believe  removed from it you will let me  then  while i remain here  call it my room assuredly this arrangement was accordingly made to the surprise of all the household  not one of whom would  indeed  have slept  or attempted to sleep there for any amount of reward  but charles holland had his own reasons for preferring that chamber  and he was conducted to it in the course of half an hour by henry  who looked around it with a shudder  as he bade his young friend good night chapter xii charles holland s sad feelings the portrait the occurrence of the night at the hall illustration charles holland wished to be alone  if ever any human being had wished fervently to be so  his thoughts were most fearfully oppressive the communication that had been made to him by henry bannerworth  had about it too many strange  confirmatory circumstances to enable him to treat it  in his own mind  with the disrespect that some mere freak of a distracted and weak imagination would  most probably  have received from him he had found flora in a state of excitement which could arise only from some such terrible cause as had been mentioned by her brother  and then he was  from an occurrence which certainly never could have entered into his calculations  asked to forego the bright dream of happiness which he had held so long and so rapturously to his heart how truly he found that the course of true love ran not smooth  and yet how little would any one have suspected that from such a cause as that which now oppressed his mind  any obstruction would arise flora might have been fickle and false  he might have seen some other fairer face  which might have enchained his fancy  and woven for him a new heart s chain  death might have stepped between him and the realization of his fondest hopes  loss of fortune might have made the love cruel which would have yoked to its distresses a young and beautiful girl  reared in the lap of luxury  and who was not  even by those who loved her  suffered to feel  even in later years  any of the pinching necessities of the family all these things were possible some of them were probable  and yet none of them had occurred  she loved him still  and he  although he had looked on many a fair face  and basked in the sunny smiles of beauty had never for a moment forgotten her faith  or lost his devotion to his own dear english girl fortune he had enough for both  death had not even threatened to rob him of the prize of such a noble and faithful heart which he had won  but a horrible superstition had arisen  which seemed to place at once an impassable abyss between them  and to say to him  in a voice of thundering denunciation charles holland  will you have a vampyre for your bride the thought was terrific  he paced the gloomy chamber to and fro with rapid strides  until the idea came across his mind that by so doing he might not only be proclaiming to his kind entertainers how much he was mentally distracted  but he likewise might be seriously distracting them the moment this occurred to him he sat down  and was profoundly still for some time  he then glanced at the light which had been given to him and he found himself almost unconsciously engaged in a mental calculation as to how long it would last him in the night half ashamed  then  of such terrors  as such a consideration would seem to indicate  he was on the point of hastily extinguishing it  when he happened to cast his eyes on the now mysterious and highly interesting portrait in the panel the picture  as a picture  was well done  whether it was a correct likeness or not of the party whom it represented  it was one of those kind of portraits that seem so life like  that  as you look at them they seem to return your gaze fully  and even to follow you with their eyes from place to place by candle light such an effect is more likely to become striking and remarkable than by daylight  and now  as charles holland shaded his own eyes from the light  so as to cast its full radiance upon the portrait he felt wonderfully interested in its life like appearance here is true skill  he said  such as i have not before seen  how strangely this likeness of a man whom i never saw seems to gaze upon me unconsciously  too  he aided the effect  which he justly enough called life like  by a slight movement of the candle  such as any one not blessed with nerves of iron would be sure to make  and such a movement made the face look as if it was inspired with vitality charles remained looking at the portrait for a considerable period of time  he found a kind of fascination in it which prevented him from drawing his eyes away from it  it was not fear which induced him to continue gazing on it  but the circumstance that it was a likeness of the man who  after death  was supposed to have borrowed so new and so hideous an existence  combined with its artistic merits  chained him to the spot i shall now  he said  know that face again  let me see it where i may  or under what circumstances i may  each feature is now indelibly fixed upon my memory i never can mistake it he turned aside as he uttered these words  and as he did so his eyes fell upon a part of the ornamental frame which composed the edge of the panel  and which seemed to him to be of a different colour from the surrounding portion curiosity and increased interest prompted him at once to make a closer inquiry into the matter  and  by a careful and diligent scrutiny  he was almost induced to come to the positive opinion  that it no very distant period in time past  the portrait had been removed from the place it occupied when once this idea  even vague and indistinct as it was  in consequence of the slight grounds he formed it on  had got possession of his mind he felt most anxious to prove its verification or its fallacy he held the candle in a variety of situations  so that its light fell in different ways on the picture  and the more he examined it  the more he felt convinced that it must have been moved lately it would appear as if  in its removal  a piece of the old oaken carved framework of the panel had been accidentally broken off  which caused the new look of the fracture  and that this accident  from the nature of the broken bit of framing  could have occurred in any other way than from an actual or attempted removal of the picture  he felt was extremely unlikely he set down the candle on a chair near at hand  and tried if the panel was fast in its place  upon the very first touch  he felt convinced it was not so  and that it easily moved  how to get it out  though presented a difficulty  and to get it out was tempting who knows  he said to himself  what may be behind it  this is an old baronial sort of hall  and the greater portion of it was  no doubt built at a time when the construction of such places as hidden chambers and intricate staircases were  in all buildings of importance considered a disiderata that he should make some discovery behind the portrait  now became an idea that possessed him strongly  although he certainly had no definite grounds for really supposing that he should do so perhaps the wish was more father to the thought than he  in the partial state of excitement he was in  really imagined  but so it was  he felt convinced that he should not be satisfied until he had removed that panel from the wall  and seen what was immediately behind it after the panel containing the picture had been placed where it was  it appeared that pieces of moulding had been inserted all around  which had had the effect of keeping it in its place  and it was a fracture of one of these pieces which had first called charles holland s attention to the probability of the picture having been removed  that he should have to get two  at least  of the pieces of moulding away  before he could hope to remove the picture  was to him quite apparent  and he was considering how he should accomplish such a result  when he was suddenly startled by a knock at his chamber door until that sudden demand for admission at his door came  he scarcely knew to what a nervous state he had worked himself up  it was an odd sort of tap one only a single tap  as if some one demanded admittance and wished to awaken his attention with the least possible chance of disturbing any one else come in  said charles  for he knew he had not fastened his door  come in there was no reply  but after a moment s pause  the same sort of low tap came again again he cried come in  but  whoever it was  seemed determined that the door should be opened for him  and no movement was made from the outside  a third time the tap came  and charles was very close to the door when he heard it  for with a noiseless step he had approached it intending to open it  the instant this third mysterious demand for admission came  he did open it wide  there was no one there  in an instant he crossed the threshold into the corridor  which ran right and left  a window at one end of it now sent in the moon s rays  so that it was tolerably light  but he could see no one  indeed  to look for any one  he felt sure was needless  for he had opened his chamber door almost simultaneously with the last knock for admission it is strange  he said  as he lingered on the threshold of his room door for some moments  my imagination could not so completely deceive me  there was most certainly a demand for admission slowly  then  he returned to his room again  and closed the door behind him one thing is evident  he said  that if i am in this apartment to be subjected to these annoyances  i shall get no rest  which will soon exhaust me this thought was a very provoking one  and the more he thought that he should ultimately find a necessity for giving up that chamber he had himself asked as a special favour to be allowed to occupy  the more vexed he became to think what construction might be put upon his conduct for so doing they will all fancy me a coward  he thought  and that i dare not sleep here  they may not  of course  say so  but they will think that my appearing so bold was one of those acts of bravado which i have not courage to carry fairly out taking this view of the matter was just the way to enlist a young man s pride in staying  under all circumstances  where he was  and  with a slight accession of colour  which  even although he was alone  would visit his cheeks  charles holland said aloud i will remain the occupant of this room come what may  happen what may no terrors  real or unsubstantial  shall drive me from it  i will brave them all  and remain here to brave them tap came the knock at the door again  and now  with more an air of vexation than fear  charles turned again towards it  and listened  tap in another minute again succeeded  and much annoyed  he walked close to the door  and laid his hand upon the lock  ready to open it at the precise moment of another demand for admission being made he had not to wait long  in about half a minute it came again  and simultaneously with the sound  the door flew open  there was no one to be seen  but  as he opened the door  he heard a strange sound in the corridor a sound which scarcely could be called a groan  and scarcely a sigh  but seemed a compound of both  having the agony of the one combined with the sadness of the other  from what direction it came he could not at the moment decide  but he called out who s there  who s there the echo of his own voice alone answered him for a few moments  and then he heard a door open  and a voice  which he knew to be henry s  cried what is it  who speaks henry  said charles yes yes yes i fear i have disturbed you you have been disturbed yourself  or you would not have done so  i shall be with you in a moment henry closed his door before charles holland could tell him not to come to him  as he intended to do  for he felt ashamed to have  in a manner of speaking  summoned assistance for so trifling a cause of alarm as that to which he had been subjected  however  he could not go to henry s chamber to forbid him from coming to his  and  more vexed than before he retired to his room again to await his coming he left the door open now  so that henry bannerworth  when he had got on some articles of dress  walked in at once  saying what has happened  charles a mere trifle  henry  concerning which i am ashamed you should have been at all disturbed never mind that  i was wakeful i heard a door open  which kept me listening  but i could not decide which door it was till i heard your voice in the corridor well  it was this door  and i opened it twice in consequence of the repeated taps for admission that came to it  some one has been knocking at it  and  when i go to it  lo  i can see nobody indeed illustration such is the case you surprise me i am very sorry to have disturbed you  because  upon such a ground  i do not feel that i ought to have done so  and  when i called out in the corridor  i assure you it was with no such intention do not regret it for a moment  said henry  you were quite justified in making an alarm on such an occasion it s strange enough  but still it may arise from some accidental cause admitting  if we did but know it  of some ready enough explanation it may  certainly  but  after what has happened already  we may well suppose a mysterious connexion between any unusual sight or sound  and the fearful ones we have already seen certainly we may how earnestly that strange portrait seems to look upon us  charles it does  and i have been examining it carefully  it seems to have been removed lately removed yes  i think  as far as i can judge  that it has been taken from its frame  i mean  that the panel on which it is painted has been taken out indeed if you touch it you will find it loose  and  upon a close examination you will perceive that a piece of the moulding which holds it in its place has been chipped off  which is done in such a place that i think it could only have arisen during the removal of the picture you must be mistaken i cannot  of course  take upon myself  henry  to say precisely such is the case  said charles but there is no one here to do so that i cannot say  will you permit me and assist me to remove it  i have a great curiosity to know what is behind it if you have  i certainly will do so  we thought of taking it away altogether  but when flora left this room the idea was given up as useless  remain here a few moments  and i will endeavour to find something which shall assist us in its removal henry left the mysterious chamber in order to search in his own for some means of removing the frame work of the picture  so that the panel would slip easily out  and while he was gone  charles holland continued gazing upon it with greater interest  if possible  than before in a few minutes henry returned  and although what he had succeeded in finding were very inefficient implements for the purpose  yet with this aid the two young men set about the task it is said  and said truly enough  that where there is a will there is a way  and although the young men had no tools at all adapted for the purpose  they did succeed in removing the moulding from the sides of the panel  and then by a little tapping at one end of it  and using a knife at a lever at the other end of the panel  they got it fairly out disappointment was all they got for their pains  on the other side there was nothing but a rough wooden wall  against which the finer and more nicely finished oak panelling of the chamber rested there is no mystery here  said henry none whatever  said charles  as he tapped the wall with his knuckles and found it all hard and sound  we are foiled we are indeed i had a strange presentiment  now  added charles  that we should make some discovery that would repay us for our trouble  it appears  however that such is not to be the case  for you see nothing presents itself to us but the most ordinary appearances i perceive as much  and the panel itself  although of more than ordinary thickness  is  after all  but a bit of planed oak  and apparently fashioned for no other object than to paint the portrait on true  shall we replace it charles reluctantly assented  and the picture was replaced in its original position  we say charles reluctantly assented  because although he had now had ocular demonstration that there was really nothing behind the panel but the ordinary woodwork which might have been expected from the construction of the old house  yet he could not  even with such a fact staring him in the face  get rid entirely of the feeling that had come across him  to the effect that the picture had some mystery or another you are not yet satisfied  said henry  as he observed the doubtful look of charles holland s face my dear friend  said charles  i will not deceive you  i am much disappointed that we have made no discovery behind that picture heaven knows we have mysteries enough in our family  said henry even as he spoke they were both startled by a strange clattering noise at the window  which was accompanied by a shrill  odd kind of shriek which sounded fearful and preternatural on the night air what is that  said charles god only knows  said henry the two young men naturally turned their earnest gaze in the direction of the window  which we have before remarked was one unprovided with shutters  and there  to their intense surprise  they saw  slowly rising up from the lower part of it  what appeared to be a human form  henry would have dashed forward  but charles restrained him  and drawing quickly from its case a large holster pistol  he levelled it carefully at the figure  saying in a whisper henry  if i don t hit it  i will consent to forfeit my head he pulled the trigger a loud report followed the room was filled with smoke  and then all was still  a circumstance  however  had occurred  as a consequence of the concussion of air produced by the discharge of the pistol  which neither of the young men had for the moment calculated upon  and that was the putting out of the only light they there had in spite of this circumstance  charles  the moment he had discharged the pistol  dropped it and sprung forward to the window  but here he was perplexed  for he could not find the old fashioned  intricate fastening which held it shut  and he had to call to henry henry  for god s sake open the window for me  henry  the fastening of the window is known to you  but not to me  open it for me thus called upon  henry sprung forward  and by this time the report of the pistol had effectually alarmed the whole household  the flashing of lights from the corridor came into the room  and in another minute  just as henry succeeded in getting the window wide open  and charles holland had made his way on to the balcony  both george bannerworth and mr marchdale entered the chamber  eager to know what had occurred  to their eager questions henry replied ask me not now  and then calling to charles  he said remain where you are  charles  while i run down to the garden immediately beneath the balcony yes yes  said charles henry made prodigious haste  and was in the garden immediately below the bay window in a wonderfully short space of time  he spoke to charles saying will you now descend  i can see nothing here  but we will both make a search george and mr  marchdale were both now in the balcony  and they would have descended likewise  but henry said do not all leave the house  god only knows  now  situated as we are what might happen i will remain  then  said george  i have been sitting up to night as the guard  and  therefore  may as well continue to do so marchdale and charles holland clambered over the balcony  and easily from its insignificant height  dropped into the garden  the night was beautiful  and profoundly still  there was not a breath of air sufficient to stir a leaf on a tree  and the very flame of the candle which charles had left burning in the balcony burnt clearly and steadily  being perfectly unruffled by any wind it cast a sufficient light close to the window to make everything very plainly visible  and it was evident at a glance that no object was there  although had that figure  which charles shot at  and no doubt hit  been flesh and blood  it must have dropped immediately below as they looked up for a moment after a cursory examination of the ground  charles exclaimed look at the window  as the light is now situated  you can see the hole made in one of the panes of glass by the passage of the bullet from my pistol they did look  and there the clear  round hole  without any starring which a bullet discharged close to a pane of glass will make in it  was clearly and plainly discernible you must have hit him  said henry one would think so  said charles  for that was the exact place where the figure was and there is nothing here  added marchdale  what can we think of these events what resource has the mind against the most dreadful suppositions concerning them charles and henry were both silent  in truth  they knew not what to think  and the words uttered by marchdale were too strikingly true to dispute for a moment  they were lost in wonder human means against such an appearance as we saw to night  said charles  are evidently useless my dear young friend  said marchdale  with much emotion  as he grasped henry bannerworth s hand  and the tears stood in his eyes as he did so my dear young friend  these constant alarms will kill you  they will drive you  and all whose happiness you hold dear  distracted  you must control these dreadful feelings  and there is but one chance that i can see of getting now the better of these what is that by leaving this place for ever alas  am i to be driven from the home of my ancestors from such a cause as this  and whither am i to fly  where are we to find a refuge  to leave here will be at once to break up the establishment which is now held together  certainly upon the sufferance of creditors  but still to their advantage  inasmuch as i am doing what no one else would do namely  paying away to within the scantiest pittance the whole proceeds of the estate that spreads around me heed nothing but an escape from such horrors as seem to be accumulating now around you if i were sure that such a removal would bring with it such a corresponding advantage  i might  indeed  be induced to risk all to accomplish it as regards poor dear flora  said mr  marchdale  i know not what to say  or what to think  she has been attacked by a vampyre  and after this mortal life shall have ended  it is dreadful to think there may be a possibility that she  with all her beauty  all her excellence and purity of mind  and all those virtues and qualities which should make her the beloved of all  and which do  indeed  attach all hearts towards her  should become one of that dreadful tribe of beings who cling to existence by feeding  in the most dreadful manner  upon the life blood of others oh  it is too dreadful to contemplate  too horrible too horrible then wherefore speak of it  said charles  with some asperity  now  by the great god of heaven  who sees all our hearts  i will not give in to such a horrible doctrine  i will not believe it  and were death itself my portion for my want of faith  i would this moment die in my disbelief of anything so truly fearful oh  my young friend  added marchdale  if anything could add to the pangs which all who love  and admire  and respect flora bannerworth must feel at the unhappy condition in which she is placed  it would be the noble nature of you  who  under happier auspices  would have been her guide through life  and the happy partner of her destiny as i will be still may heaven forbid it  we are now among ourselves  and can talk freely upon such a subject  mr  charles holland  if you wed  you would look forward to being blessed with children those sweet ties which bind the sternest hearts to life with so exquisite a bondage  oh  fancy  then for a moment  the mother of your babes coming at the still hour of midnight to drain from their veins the very life blood she gave to them to drive you and them mad with the expected horror of such visitations to make your nights hideous your days but so many hours of melancholy retrospection  oh  you know not the world of terror  on the awful brink of which you stand  when you talk of making flora bannerworth a wife peace  oh  peace  said henry nay  i know my words are unwelcome  continued mr  marchdale  it happens  unfortunately for human nature  that truth and some of our best and holiest feelings are too often at variance  and hold a sad contest i will hear no more of this  cried charles holland i will hear no more i have done  said mr  marchdale and twere well you had not begun nay  say not so  i have but done what i considered was a solemn duty under that assumption of doing duty a solemn duty heedless of the feelings and the opinions of others  said charles  sarcastically  more mischief is produced more heart burnings and anxieties caused  than by any other two causes of such mischievous results combined  i wish to hear no more of this do not be angered with mr  marchdale  charles  said henry  he can have no motive but our welfare in what he says  we should not condemn a speaker because his words may not sound pleasant to our ears by heaven  said charles  with animation  i meant not to be illiberal but i will not because i cannot see a man s motives for active interference in the affairs of others  always be ready  merely on account of such ignorance  to jump to a conclusion that they must be estimable to morrow  i leave this house  said marchdale leave us  exclaimed henry ay  for ever nay  now  mr  marchdale  is this generous am i treated generously by one who is your own guest  and towards whom i was willing to hold out the honest right hand of friendship henry turned to charles holland  saying charles  i know your generous nature  say you meant no offence to my mother s old friend if to say i meant no offence  said charles  is to say i meant no insult  i say it freely enough  cried marchdale  i am satisfied but do not  added charles  draw me any more such pictures as the one you have already presented to my imagination  i beg of you  from the storehouse of my own fancy i can find quite enough to make me wretched if i choose to be so  but again and again do i say i will not allow this monstrous superstition to tread me down  like the tread of a giant on a broken reed  i will contend against it while i have life to do so bravely spoken and when i desert flora bannerworth  may heaven  from that moment desert me charles  cried henry  with emotion  dear charles  my more than friend brother of my heart noble charles nay  henry  i am not entitled to your praises  i were base indeed to be other than that which i purpose to be  come weal or woe come what may i am the affianced husband of your sister  and she  and she only  can break asunder the tie that binds me to her chapter xiii the offer for the hall the visit to sir francis varney the strange resemblance a dreadful suggestion illustration the party made a strict search through every nook and corner of the garden  but it proved to be a fruitless one  not the least trace of any one could be found  there was only one circumstance  which was pondered over deeply by them all  and that was that  beneath the window of the room in which flora and her mother sat while the brothers were on their visit to the vault of their ancestors  were visible marks of blood to a considerable extent it will be remembered that flora had fired a pistol at the spectral appearance  and that immediately upon that it had disappeared  after uttering a sound which might well be construed into a cry of pain from a wound that a wound then had been inflicted upon some one  the blood beneath the window now abundantly testified  and when it was discovered  henry and charles made a very close examination indeed of the garden  to discover what direction the wounded figure  be it man or vampyre  had taken illustration but the closest scrutiny did not reveal to them a single spot of blood beyond the space immediately beneath the window there the apparition seemed to have received its wound  and then  by some mysterious means to have disappeared at length  wearied with the continued excitement  combined with want of sleep  to which they had been subjected  they returned to the hall flora  with the exception of the alarm she experienced from the firing of the pistol  had met with no disturbance  and that  in order to spare her painful reflections  they told her was merely done as a precautionary measure  to proclaim to any one who might be lurking in the garden that the inmates of the house were ready to defend themselves against any aggression whether or not she believed this kind deceit they knew not  she only sighed deeply  and wept  the probability is  that she more than suspected the vampyre had made another visit  but they forbore to press the point  and  leaving her with her mother  henry and george went from her chamber again the former to endeavour to seek some repose  as it would be his turn to watch on the succeeding night  and the latter to resume his station in a small room close to flora s chamber  where it had been agreed watch and ward should be kept by turns while the alarm lasted at length  the morning again dawned upon that unhappy family  and to none were its beams more welcome the birds sang their pleasant carols beneath the window  the sweet deep coloured autumnal sun shone upon all objects with a golden luster and to look abroad  upon the beaming face of nature  no one could for a moment suppose  except from sad experience  that there were such things as gloom  misery  and crime  upon the earth and must i  said henry  as he gazed from a window of the hall upon the undulating park  the majestic trees  the flowers  the shrubs  and the many natural beauties with which the place was full must i be chased from this spot  the home of my self and of my kindred  by a phantom must i indeed seek refuge elsewhere  because my own home has become hideous it was indeed a cruel and a painful thought  it was one he yet would not  could not be convinced was absolutely necessary  but now the sun was shining  it was morning  and the feelings  which found a home in his breast amid the darkness  the stillness  and the uncertainty of night were chased away by those glorious beams of sunlight  that fell upon hill  valley  and stream  and the thousand sweet sounds of life and animation that filled that sunny air such a revulsion of feeling was natural enough  many of the distresses and mental anxieties of night vanish with the night  and those which oppressed the heart of henry bannerworth were considerably modified he was engaged in these reflections when he heard the sound of the lodge bell  and as a visitor was now somewhat rare at this establishment  he waited with some anxiety to see to whom he was indebted for so early a call in the course of a few minutes  one of the servants came to him with a letter in her hand it bore a large handsome seal  and  from its appearance  would seem to have come from some personage of consequence  a second glance at it shewed him the name of varney  in the corner  and  with some degree of vexation  he muttered to himself another condoling epistle from the troublesome neighbour whom i have not yet seen if you please  sir  said the servant who had brought him the letter as i m here  and you are here  perhaps you ll have no objection to give me what i m to have for the day and two nights as i ve been here  cos i can t stay in a family as is so familiar with all sorts o  ghostesses  i ain t used to such company what do you mean  said henry the question was a superfluous one  too well he knew what the woman meant  and the conviction came across his mind strongly that no domestic would consent to live long in a house which was subject to such dreadful visitations what does i mean  said the woman why  sir  if it s all the same to you  i don t myself come of a wampyre family  and i don t choose to remain in a house where there is sich things encouraged  that s what i means  sir what wages are owing to you  said henry why  as to wages  i only comed here by the day go  then  and settle with my mother  the sooner you leave this house the better oh  indeed  i m sure i don t want to stay this woman was one of those who were always armed at all points for a row  and she had no notion of concluding any engagement  of any character whatever  without some disturbance  therefore  to see henry take what she said with such provoking calmness was aggravating in the extreme  but there was no help for such a source of vexation  she could find no other ground of quarrel than what was connected with the vampyre  and  as henry would not quarrel with her on such a score  she was compelled to give it up in despair when henry found himself alone  and free from the annoyance of this woman  he turned his attention to the letter he held in his hand  and which  from the autograph in the corner  he knew came from his new neighbour  sir francis varney  whom  by some chance or another  he had never yet seen to his great surprise  he found that the letter contained the following words      dear sir as a neighbour  by purchase of an estate contiguous      to your own  i am quite sure you have excused  and taken in good      part  the cordial offer i made to you of friendship and service      some short time since  but now  in addressing to you a distinct      proposition  i trust i shall meet with an indulgent      consideration  whether such proposition be accordant with your      views or not      what i have heard from common report induces me to believe that      bannerworth hall cannot be a desirable residence for yourself  or      your amiable sister  if i am right in that conjecture  and you      have any serious thought of leaving the place  i would earnestly      recommend you  as one having some experience in such descriptions      of property  to sell it at once      now  the proposition with which i conclude this letter is  i      know  of a character to make you doubt the disinterestedness of      such advice  but that it is disinterested  nevertheless  is a      fact of which i can assure my own heart  and of which i beg to      assure you  i propose  then  should you  upon consideration      decide upon such a course of proceeding  to purchase of you the      hall  i do not ask for a bargain on account of any extraneous      circumstances which may at the present time depreciate the value      of the property  but i am willing to give a fair price for it      under these circumstances  i trust  sir  that you will give a      kindly consideration to my offer  and even if you reject it  i      hope that  as neighbours  we may live long in peace and amity      and in the interchange of those good offices which should subsist      between us  awaiting your reply      believe me to be  dear sir      your very obedient servant      francis varney      to henry bannerworth  esq henry  after having read this most unobjectionable letter through folded it up again  and placed it in his pocket  clasping his hands then  behind his back  a favourite attitude of his when he was in deep contemplation  he paced to and fro in the garden for some time in deep thought how strange  he muttered  it seems that every circumstance combines to induce me to leave my old ancestral home  it appears as if everything now that happened had that direct tendency  what can be the meaning of all this  tis very strange amazingly strange  here arise circumstances which are enough to induce any man to leave a particular place  then a friend  in whose single mindedness and judgment i know i can rely advises the step  and immediately upon the back of that comes a fair and candid offer there was an apparent connexion between all these circumstances which much puzzled henry  he walked to and fro for nearly an hour  until he heard a hasty footstep approaching him  and upon looking in the direction from whence it came  he saw mr  marchdale i will seek marchdale s advice  he said  upon this matter  i will hear what he says concerning it henry  said marchdale  when he came sufficiently near to him for conversation  why do you remain here alone i have received a communication from our neighbour  sir francis varney  said henry indeed it is here  peruse it for yourself  and then tell me  marchdale candidly what you think of it i suppose  said marchdale  as he opened the letter  it is another friendly note of condolence on the state of your domestic affairs which  i grieve to say  from the prattling of domestics  whose tongues it is quite impossible to silence  have become food for gossip all over the neighbouring villages and estates if anything could add another pang to those i have already been made to suffer  said henry  it would certainly arise from being made the food of vulgar gossip  but read the letter  marchdale  you will find its contents of a more important character than you anticipate indeed  said marchdale  as he ran his eyes eagerly over the note when he had finished it he glanced at henry  who then said well  what is your opinion i know not what to say  henry  you know that my own advice to you has been to get rid of this place it has with the hope that the disagreeable affair connected with it now may remain connected with it as a house  and not with you and yours as a family it may be so there appears to me every likelihood of it i do not know  said henry  with a shudder  i must confess  marchdale that to my own perceptions it seems more probable that the infliction we have experienced from the strange visitor  who seems now resolved to pester us with visits  will rather attach to a family than to a house the vampyre may follow us if so  of course the parting with the hall would be a great pity  and no gain none in the least henry  a thought has struck me let s hear it  marchdale it is this suppose you were to try the experiment of leaving the hall without selling it  suppose for one year you were to let it to some one henry it might be done ay  and it might  with very great promise and candour  be proposed to this very gentleman  sir francis varney  to take it for one year  to see how he liked it before becoming the possessor of it  then if he found himself tormented by the vampyre  he need not complete the purchase  or if you found that the apparition followed you from hence  you might yourself return  feeling that perhaps here  in the spots familiar to your youth  you might be most happy  even under such circumstances as at present oppress you most happy  ejaculated henry perhaps i should not have used that word i am sure you should not  said henry  when you speak of me well well  let us hope that the time may not be very far distant when i may use the term happy  as applied to you  in the most conclusive and the strongest manner it can be used oh  said henry  i will hope  but do not mock me with it now marchdale  i pray you heaven forbid that i should mock you well well  i do not believe you are the man to do so to any one  but about this affair of the house distinctly  then  if i were you  i would call upon sir francis varney and make him an offer to become a tenant of the hall for twelve months during which time you could go where you please  and test the fact of absence ridding you or not ridding you of the dreadful visitant who makes the night here truly hideous i will speak to my mother  to george  and to my sister of the matter they shall decide mr  marchdale now strove in every possible manner to raise the spirits of henry bannerworth  by painting to him the future in far more radiant colours than the present  and endeavouring to induce a belief in his mind that a short period of time might after all replace in his mind and in the minds of those who were naturally so dear to him  all their wonted serenity henry  although he felt not much comfort from these kindly efforts  yet could feel gratitude to him who made them  and after expressing such a feeling to marchdale  in strong terms  he repaired to the house  in order to hold a solemn consultation with those whom he felt ought to be consulted as well as himself as to what steps should be taken with regard to the hall the proposition  or rather the suggestion  which had been made by marchdale upon the proposition of sir francis varney  was in every respect so reasonable and just  that it met  as was to be expected  with the concurrence of every member of the family flora s cheeks almost resumed some of their wonted colour at the mere thought now of leaving that home to which she had been at one time so much attached yes  dear henry  she said  let us leave here if you are agreeable so to do  and in leaving this house  we will believe that we leave behind us a world of terror flora  remarked henry  in a tone of slight reproach  if you were so anxious to leave bannerworth hall  why did you not say so before this proposition came from other mouths  you know your feelings upon such a subject would have been laws to me i knew you were attached to the old house  said flora  and  besides events have come upon us all with such fearful rapidity  there has scarcely been time to think true true and you will leave  henry i will call upon sir francis varney myself  and speak to him upon the subject a new impetus to existence appeared now to come over the whole family at the idea of leaving a place which always would be now associated in their minds with so much terror  each member of the family felt happier and breathed more freely than before  so that the change which had come over them seemed almost magical  and charles holland  too  was much better pleased  and he whispered to flora dear flora  you will now surely no longer talk of driving from you the honest heart that loves you hush  charles  hush  she said  meet me an hour hence in the garden and we will talk of this that hour will seem an age  he said henry  now  having made a determination to see sir francis varney  lost no time in putting it into execution  at mr  marchdale s own request  he took him with him  as it was desirable to have a third person present in the sort of business negotiation which was going on  the estate which had been so recently entered upon by the person calling himself sir francis varney  and which common report said he had purchased  was a small  but complete property  and situated so close to the grounds connected with bannerworth hall  that a short walk soon placed henry and mr  marchdale before the residence of this gentleman  who had shown so kindly a feeling towards the bannerworth family have you seen sir francis varney  asked henry of mr  marchdale  as he rung the gate bell i have not  have you no  i never saw him  it is rather awkward our both being absolute strangers to his person we can but send in our names  however  and  from the great vein of courtesy that runs through his letter  i have no doubt but we shall receive the most gentlemanly reception from him a servant in handsome livery appeared at the iron gates  which opened upon a lawn in the front of sir francis varney s house  and to this domestic henry bannerworth handed his card  on which he had written  in pencil  likewise the name of mr  marchdale if your master  he said  is within  we shall be glad to see him sir francis is at home  sir  was the reply  although not very well if you will be pleased to walk in  i will announce you to him henry and marchdale followed the man into a handsome enough reception room  where they were desired to wait while their names were announced do you know if this gentleman be a baronet  said henry  or a knight merely i really do not  i never saw him in my life  or heard of him before he came into this neighbourhood and i have been too much occupied with the painful occurrences of this hall to know anything of our neighbours  i dare say mr  chillingworth if we had thought to ask him  would have known something concerning him no doubt this brief colloquy was put an end to by the servant  who said my master  gentlemen  is not very well  but he begs me to present his best compliments  and to say he is much gratified with your visit  and will be happy to see you in his study henry and marchdale followed the man up a flight of stone stairs  and then they were conducted through a large apartment into a smaller one there was very little light in this small room  but at the moment of their entrance a tall man  who was seated  rose  and  touching the spring of a blind that was to the window  it was up in a moment admitting a broad glare of light  a cry of surprise  mingled with terror  came from henry bannerworth s lip  the original of the portrait on the panel stood before him  there was the lofty stature  the long sallow face  the slightly projecting teeth  the dark  lustrous  although somewhat sombre eyes  the expression of the features all were alike are you unwell  sir  said sir francis varney  in soft  mellow accents as he handed a chair to the bewildered henry god of heaven  said henry  how like you seem surprised  sir  have you ever seen me before sir francis drew himself up to his full height  and cast a strange glance upon henry  whose eyes were rivetted upon his face  as if with a species of fascination which he could not resist marchdale  henry gasped  marchdale  my friend  marchdale  i i am surely mad hush  be calm  whispered marchdale calm calm can you not see  marchdale  is this a dream look look oh  look for god s sake  henry  compose yourself is your friend often thus  said sir francis varney  with the same mellifluous tone which seemed habitual to him no  sir  he is not  but recent circumstances have shattered his nerves and  to tell the truth  you bear so strong a resemblance to an old portrait  in his house  that i do not wonder so much as i otherwise should at his agitation indeed a resemblance  said henry  a resemblance  god of heaven  it is the face itself you much surprise me  said sir francis illustration henry sunk into the chair which was near him  and he trembled violently the rush of painful thoughts and conjectures that came through his mind was enough to make any one tremble  is this the vampyre  was the horrible question that seemed impressed upon his very brain  in letters of flame  is this the vampyre are you better  sir  said sir francis varney  in his bland  musical voice  shall i order any refreshment for you no no  gasped henry  for the love of truth tell me  is is your name really varney sir have you no other name to which  perhaps  a better title you could urge mr  bannerworth  i can assure you that i am too proud of the name of the family to which i belong to exchange it for any other  be it what it may how wonderfully like i grieve to see you so much distressed  mr  bannerworth  i presume ill health has thus shattered your nerves no  ill health has not done the work  i know not what to say  sir francis varney  to you  but recent events in my family have made the sight of you full of horrible conjectures what mean you  sir you know  from common report  that we have had a fearful visitor at our house a vampyre  i have heard  said sir francis varney  with a bland  and almost beautiful smile  which displayed his white glistening teeth to perfection yes  a vampyre  and and i pray you go on  sir  you surely are far above the vulgar superstition of believing in such matters my judgment is assailed in too many ways and shapes for it to hold out probably as it ought to do against so hideous a belief  but never was it so much bewildered as now why so because nay  henry  whispered mr  marchdale  it is scarcely civil to tell sir francis to his face  that he resembles a vampyre i must  i must pray  sir  interrupted varney to marchdale  permit mr  bannerworth to speak here freely  there is nothing in the whole world i so much admire as candour then you so much resemble the vampyre  added henry  that that i know not what to think is it possible  said varney it is a damning fact well  it s unfortunate for me  i presume  ah varney gave a twinge of pain  as if some sudden bodily ailment had attacked him severely you are unwell  sir  said marchdale no  no no  he said  i hurt my arm  and happened accidentally to touch the arm of this chair with it a hurt  said henry yes  mr  bannerworth a a wound yes  a wound  but not much more than skin deep  in fact  little beyond an abrasion of the skin may i inquire how you came by it oh  yes  a slight fall indeed remarkable  is it not  very remarkable  we never know a moment when from same most trifling cause  we may receive really some serious bodily harm  how true it is  mr  bannerworth  that in the midst of life we are in death and equally true  perhaps  said henry  that in the midst of death there may be found a horrible life well  i should not wonder  there are really so many strange things in this world  that i have left off wondering at anything now there are strange things  said henry  you wish to purchase of me the hall  sir if you wish to sell you you are perhaps attached to the place  perhaps you recollected it sir  long ago not very long  smiled sir francis varney  it seems a nice comfortable old house  and the grounds  too  appear to be amazingly well wooded which  to one of rather a romantic temperament like myself  is always an additional charm to a place  i was extremely pleased with it the first time i beheld it  and a desire to call myself the owner of it took possession of my mind  the scenery is remarkable for its beauty  and from what i have seen of it  it is rarely to be excelled  no doubt you are greatly attached to it it has been my home from infancy  returned henry  and being also the residence of my ancestors for centuries  it is natural that i should be so true true the house  no doubt  has suffered much  said henry  within the last hundred years no doubt it has  a hundred years is a tolerable long space of time  you know it is  indeed  oh  how any human life which is spun out to such an extent  must lose its charms  by losing all its fondest and dearest associations ah  how true  said sir francis varney  he had some minutes previously touched a bell  and at this moment a servant brought in on a tray some wine and refreshments chapter xiv henry s agreement with sir francis varney the sudden arrival at the hall flora s alarm illustration on the tray which the servant brought into the room  were refreshments of different kinds  including wine  and after waving his hand for the domestic to retire  sir francis varney said you will be better  mr  bannerworth  for a glass of wine after your walk  and you too  sir  i am ashamed to say  i have quite forgotten your name marchdale mr  marchdale  ay  marchdale  pray  sir  help yourself you take nothing yourself  said henry i am under a strict regimen  replied varney  the simplest diet alone does for me  and i have accustomed myself to long abstinence he will not eat or drink  muttered henry  abstractedly will you sell me the hall  said sir francis varney henry looked in his face again  from which he had only momentarily withdrawn his eyes  and he was then more struck than ever with the resemblance between him and the portrait on the panel of what had been flora s chamber  what made that resemblance  too  one about which there could scarcely be two opinions  was the mark or cicatrix of a wound in the forehead  which the painter had slightly indented in the portrait but which was much more plainly visible on the forehead of sir francis varney  now that henry observed this distinctive mark  which he had not done before  he could feel no doubt  and a sickening sensation came over him at the thought that he was actually now in the presence of one of those terrible creatures  vampyres you do not drink  said varney  most young men are not so modest with a decanter of unimpeachable wine before them  i pray you help yourself i cannot henry rose as he spoke  and turning to marchdale  he said  in addition will you come away if you please  said marchdale  rising but you have not  my dear sir  said varney  given me yet any answer about the hall i cannot yet  answered henry  i will think  my present impression is to let you have it on whatever terms you may yourself propose  always provided you consent to one of mine name it that you never show yourself in my family how very unkind  i understand you have a charming sister  young beautiful  and accomplished  shall i confess  now  that i had hopes of making myself agreeable to her you make yourself agreeable to her  the sight of you would blast her for ever  and drive her to madness am i so hideous no  but you are what am i hush  henry  hush  cried marchdale  remember you are in this gentleman s house true  true  why does he tempt me to say these dreadful things  i do not want to say them come away  then come away at once  sir francis varney  my friend  mr bannerworth  will think over your offer  and let you know  i think you may consider that your wish to become the purchaser of the hall will be complied with i wish to have it  said varney  and i can only say  that if i am master of it  i shall be very happy to see any of the family on a visit at any time a visit  said henry  with a shudder  a visit to the tomb were far more desirable  farewell  sir adieu  said sir francis varney  and he made one of the most elegant bows in the world  while there came over his face a peculiarity of expression that was strange  if not painful  to contemplate  in another minute henry and marchdale were clear of the house  and with feelings of bewilderment and horror  which beggar all description  poor henry allowed himself to be led by the arm by marchdale to some distance without uttering a word  when he did speak  he said marchdale  it would be charity of some one to kill me to kill you yes  for i am certain otherwise that i must go mad nay  nay  rouse yourself this man  varney  is a vampyre hush  hush i tell you  marchdale  cried henry  in a wild  excited manner  he is a vampyre  he is the dreadful being who visited flora at the still hour of midnight  and drained the life blood from her veins  he is a vampyre there are such things  i cannot doubt now  oh  god  i wish now that your lightnings would blast me  as here i stand  for over into annihilation for i am going mad to be compelled to feel that such horrors can really have existence henry henry nay  talk not to me  what can i do  shall i kill him  is it not a sacred duty to destroy such a thing  oh  horror horror  he must be killed destroyed burnt  and the very dust to which he is consumed must be scattered to the winds of heaven  it would be a deed well done marchdale hush  hush  these words are dangerous i care not what if they were overheard now by unfriendly ears  what might not be the uncomfortable results  i pray you be more cautious what you say of this strange man i must destroy him and wherefore can you ask  is he not a vampyre yes  but reflect  henry  for a moment upon the length to which you might carry out so dangerous an argument  it is said that vampyres are made by vampyres sucking the blood of those who  but for that circumstance  would have died and gone to decay in the tomb along with ordinary mortals  but that being so attacked during life by a vampyre they themselves  after death  become such well well  what is that to me have you forgotten flora a cry of despair came from poor henry s lips  and in a moment he seemed completely  mentally and physically  prostrated god of heaven  he moaned  i had forgotten her i thought you had oh  if the sacrifice of my own life would suffice to put an end to all this accumulating horror  how gladly would i lay it down  ay  in any way in any way  no mode of death should appal me  no amount of pain make me shrink  i could smile then upon the destroyer  and say welcome welcome most welcome rather  henry  seek to live for those whom you love than die for them your death would leave them desolate  in life you may ward off many a blow of fate from them i may endeavour so to do consider that flora may be wholly dependent upon such kindness as you may be able to bestow upon her charles clings to her humph you do not doubt him my dear friend  henry bannerworth  although i am not an old man  yet i am so much older than you that i have seen a great deal of the world and am  perhaps  far better able to come to accurate judgments with regard to individuals no doubt no doubt  but yet nay  hear me out  such judgments  founded upon experience  when uttered have all the character of prophecy about them  i  therefore  now prophecy to you that charles holland will yet be so stung with horror at the circumstance of a vampyre visiting flora  that he will never make her his wife marchdale  i differ from you most completely  said henry  i know that charles holland is the very soul of honour i cannot argue the matter with you  it has not become a thing of fact i have only sincerely to hope that i am wrong you are  you may depend  entirely wrong  i cannot be deceived in charles  from you such words produce no effect but one of regret that you should so much err in your estimate of any one  from any one but yourself they would have produced in me a feeling of anger i might have found it difficult to smother it has often been my misfortune through life  said mr  marchdale sadly  to give the greatest offence where i feel the truest friendship because it is in such quarters that i am always tempted to speak too freely nay  no offence  said henry  i am distracted  and scarcely know what i say  marchdale  i know you are my sincere friend but  as i tell you i am nearly mad my dear henry  be calmer  consider upon what is to be said concerning this interview at home ay  that is a consideration i should not think it advisable to mention the disagreeable fact  that in your neighbour you think you have found out the nocturnal disturber of your family no no i would say nothing of it  it is not at all probable that  after what you have said to him this sir francis varney  or whatever his real name may be will obtrude himself upon you if he should he die he will  perhaps  consider that such a step would be dangerous to him it would be fatal  so help me  however  and then would i take especial care that no power of resuscitation should ever enable that man again to walk the earth they say that only way of destroying a vampyre is to fix him to the earth with a stake  so that he cannot move  and then  of course decomposition will take its course  as in ordinary cases fire would consume him  and be a quicker process  said henry  but these are fearful reflections  and  for the present  we will not pursue them  now to play the hypocrite  and endeavour to look composed and serene to my mother  and to flora while my heart is breaking the two friends had by this time reached the hall  and leaving his friend marchdale  henry bannerworth  with feelings of the most unenviable description  slowly made his way to the apartment occupied by his mother and sister illustration chapter xv the old admiral and his servant the communication from the landlord of the nelson s arms illustration while those matters of most grave and serious import were going on at the hall  while each day  and almost each hour in each day  was producing more and more conclusive evidence upon a matter which at first had seemed too monstrous to be at all credited  it may well be supposed what a wonderful sensation was produced among the gossip mongers of the neighbourhood by the exaggerated reports that had reached them the servants  who had left the hall on no other account  as they declared  but sheer fright at the awful visits of the vampyre  spread the news far and wide  so that in the adjoining villages and market towns the vampyre of bannerworth hall became quite a staple article of conversation such a positive godsend for the lovers of the marvellous had not appeared in the country side within the memory of that sapient individual the oldest inhabitant and  moreover  there was one thing which staggered some people of better education and maturer judgments  and that was  that the more they took pains to inquire into the matter  in order  if possible  to put an end to what they considered a gross lie from the commencement  the more evidence they found to stagger their own senses upon the subject everywhere then  in every house  public as well as private  something was being continually said of the vampyre  nursery maids began to think a vampyre vastly superior to old scratch and old bogie  as a means of terrifying their infant charges into quietness  if not to sleep  until they themselves became too much afraid upon the subject to mention it but nowhere was gossiping carried on upon the subject with more systematic fervour than at an inn called the nelson s arms  which was in the high street of the nearest market town to the hall there  it seemed as if the lovers of the horrible made a point of holding their head quarters  and so thirsty did the numerous discussions make the guests  that the landlord was heard to declare that he  from his heart  really considered a vampyre as very nearly equal to a contested election it was towards evening of the same day that marchdale and henry made their visit to sir francis varney  that a postchaise drew up to the inn we have mentioned  in the vehicle were two persons of exceedingly dissimilar appearance and general aspect one of these people was a man who seemed fast verging upon seventy years of age  although  from his still ruddy and embrowned complexion and stentorian voice  it was quite evident he intended yet to keep time at arm s length for many years to come he was attired in ample and expensive clothing  but every article had a naval animus about it  if we may be allowed such an expression with regard to clothing  on his buttons was an anchor  and the general assortment and colour of the clothing as nearly assimilated as possible to the undress naval uniform of an officer of high rank some fifty or sixty years ago his companion was a younger man  and about his appearance there was no secret at all  he was a genuine sailor  and he wore the shore costume of one  he was hearty looking  and well dressed  and evidently well fed as the chaise drove up to the door of the inn  this man made an observation to the other to the following effect a hoy well  you lubber  what now  cried the other they call this the nelson s arms  and you know  shiver me  that for the best half of his life he had but one d n you  was the only rejoinder he got for this observation  but with that  he seemed very well satisfied heave to  he then shouted to the postilion  who was about to drive the chaise into the yard  heave to  you lubberly son of a gun  we don t want to go into dock ah  said the old man  let s get out  jack  this is the port  and  do you hear  and be cursed to you  let s have no swearing  d n you  nor bad language  you lazy swab aye  aye  cried jack  i ve not been ashore now a matter o  ten years and not larnt a little shore going politeness  admiral  i ain t been your walley de sham  without larning a little about land reckonings nobody would take me for a sailor now  i m thinking  admiral hold your noise aye  aye  sir jack  as he was called  bundled out of the chaise when the door was opened  with a movement so closely resembling what would have ensued had he been dragged out by the collar  that one was tempted almost to believe that such a feat must have been accomplished all at once by some invisible agency he then assisted the old gentleman to alight  and the landlord of the inn commenced the usual profusion of bows with which a passenger by a postchaise is usually welcomed in preference to one by a stage coach be quiet  will you  shouted the admiral  for such indeed he was  be quiet best accommodation  sir good wine well aired beds good attendance fine air belay there  said jack  and he gave the landlord what no doubt he considered a gentle admonition  but which consisted of such a dig in the ribs  that he made as many evolutions as the clown in a pantomime when he vociferates hot codlings now  jack  where s the sailing instructions  said his master here  sir  in the locker  said jack  as he took from his pocket a letter  which he handed to the admiral won t you step in  sir  said the landlord  who had begun now to recover a little from the dig in the ribs what s the use of coming into port and paying harbour dues  and all that sort of thing  till we know if it s the right  you lubber  eh no  oh  dear me  sir  of course god bless me  what can the old gentleman mean the admiral opened the letter  and read      if you stop at the nelson s aims at uxotter  you will hear of      me  and i can be sent for  when i will tell you more      yours  very obediently and humbly      josiah crinkles who the deuce is he this is uxotter  sir  said the landlord  and here you are  sir  at the nelson s arms  good beds good wine good silence yes  sir oh  of course who the devil is josiah crinkles ha  ha  ha  ha  makes me laugh  sir  who the devil indeed  they do say the devil and lawyers  sir  know something of each other makes me smile i ll make you smile on the other side of that d d great hatchway of a mouth of yours in a minute  who is crinkles oh  mr  crinkles  sir  everybody knows  most respectable attorney  sir indeed  highly respectable man  sir a lawyer yes  sir  a lawyer well  i m d d jack gave a long whistle  and both master and man looked at each other aghast now  hang me  cried the admiral  if ever i was so taken in in all my life ay  ay  sir  said jack to come a hundred and seventy miles see a d d swab of a rascally lawyer ay  ay  sir i ll smash him jack yer honour get into the chaise again well  but where s master charles  lawyers  in course

a baby  i am don t do it confound you  who is doing it the devil who is don t  then thus wrangling  they entered the inn  to the great amusement of several bystanders  who had collected to hear the altercation between them would you like a private room  sir  said the landlord what s that to you  said jack hold your noise  will you  cried his master  yes  i should like a private room  and some grog strong as the devil  put in jack yes  sir yes  sir  good wines good beds good you said all that before  you know  remarked jack  as he bestowed upon the landlord another terrific dig in the ribs hilloa  cried the admiral  you can send for that infernal lawyer mister landlord mr  crinkles  sir yes  yes who may i have the honour to say  sir  wants to see him admiral bell certainly  admiral  certainly  you ll find him a very conversible nice  gentlemanly little man  sir and tell him as jack pringle is here  too  cried the seaman oh  yes  yes of course  said the landlord  who was in such a state of confusion from the digs in the ribs he had received and the noise his guests had already made in his house  that  had he been suddenly put upon his oath  he would scarcely have liked to say which was the master and which was the man the idea now  jack  said the admiral  of coming all this way to see a lawyer ay  ay  sir if he d said he was a lawyer  we would have known what to do  but it s a take in  jack so i think  howsomdever  we ll serve him out when we catch him  you know good so we will and  then  again  he may know something about master charles  sir  you know  lord love him  don t you remember when he came aboard to see you once at portsmouth ah  i do  indeed and how he said he hated the french  and quite a baby  too  what perseverance and sense  uncle  says he to you  when i m a big man i ll go in a ship  and fight all the french in a heap  says he  and beat em  my boy  too  says you  cos you thought he d forgot that  and then he says  what s the use of saying that  stupid don t we always beat em the admiral laughed and rubbed his hands  as he cried aloud i remember  jack i remember him  i was stupid to make such a remark i know you was a d d old fool i thought you come  come  hilloa  there well  then  what do you call me no seaman for why  jack  you bear malice like a marine there you go again  goodbye  do you remember when we were yard arm to yard arm with those two yankee frigates  and took em both  you didn t call me a marine then  when the scuppers were running with blood  was i a seaman then you were  jack you were  and you saved my life i didn t you did i say i didn t it was a marlin spike but i say you did  you rascally scoundrel i say you did  and i won t be contradicted in my own ship call this your ship no  d n it i mr  crinkles  said the landlord  flinging the door wide open  and so at once putting an end to the discussion which always apparently had a tendency to wax exceedingly warm the shark  by g d  said jack a little  neatly dressed man made his appearance  and advanced rather timidly into the room  perhaps he had heard from the landlord that the parties who had sent for him were of rather a violent sort so you are crinkles  are you  cried the admiral  sit down  though you are a lawyer thank you  sir  i am an attorney  certainly  and my name as certainly is crinkles look at that the admiral placed the letter in the little lawyer s hands  who said am i to read it yes  to be sure aloud read it to the devil  if you like  in a pig s whisper  or a west india hurricane oh  very good  sir  i i am willing to be agreeable  so i ll read it aloud  if it s all the same to you he then opened the letter  and read as follows      to admiral bell      admiral being  from various circumstances  aware that you take      a warm and a praiseworthy interest in your nephew  charles      holland  i venture to write to you concerning a matter in which      your immediate and active co operation with others may rescue him      from a condition which will prove  if allowed to continue  very      much to his detriment  and ultimate unhappiness      you are  then  hereby informed  that he  charles holland  has      much earlier than he ought to have done  returned to england  and      that the object of his return is to contract a marriage into a      family in every way objectionable  and with a girl who is highly      objectionable      you  admiral  are his nearest and almost his only relative in      the world  you are the guardian of his property  and  therefore      it becomes a duty on your part to interfere to save him from the      ruinous consequences of a marriage  which is sure to bring ruin      and distress upon himself and all who take an interest in his      welfare      the family he wishes to marry into is named bannerworth  and the      young lady s name is flora bannerworth  when  however  i inform      you that a vampyre is in that family  and that if he marries into      it  he marries a vampyre  and will have vampyres for children  i      trust i have said enough to warn you upon the subject  and to      induce you to lose no time in repairing to the spot      if you stop at the nelson s arms at uxotter  you will hear of      me  i can be sent for  when i will tell you more      yours  very obediently and humbly      josiah crinkles      p s  i enclose you dr  johnson s definition of a vampyre  which      is as follows      vampyre a german blood sucker by which you perceive how many      vampyres  from time immemorial  must have been well entertained      at the expense of john bull  at the court of st  james  where no      thing hardly is to be met with but german blood suckers illustration                                    the lawyer ceased to read  and the amazed look with which he glanced at the face of admiral bell would  under any other circumstances  have much amused him  his mind  however  was by far too much engrossed with a consideration of the danger of charles holland  his nephew  to be amused at anything  so  when he found that the little lawyer said nothing  he bellowed out well  sir we we well  said the attorney i ve sent for you  and here you are  and here i am  and here s jack pringle  what have you got to say just this much  said mr  crinkles  recovering himself a little  just this much  sir  that i never saw that letter before in all my life you never saw it never didn t you write it on my solemn word of honour  sir  i did not jack pringle whistled  and the admiral looked puzzled  like the admiral in the song  too  he grew paler  and then mr  crinkles added who has forged my name to a letter such as this  i cannot imagine  as for writing to you  sir  i never heard of your existence  except publicly  as one of those gallant officers who have spent a long life in nobly fighting their country s battles  and who are entitled to the admiration and the applause of every englishman jack and the admiral looked at each other in amazement  and then the latter exclaimed what  this from a lawyer a lawyer  sir  said crinkles  may know how to appreciate the deeds of gallant men  although he may not be able to imitate them  that letter sir  is a forgery  and i now leave you  only much gratified at the incident which has procured me the honour of an interview with a gentleman  whose name will live in the history of his country  good day sir  good day no  i m d d if you go like that  said jack  as he sprang to the door  and put his back against it  you shall take a glass with me in honour of the wooden walls of old england  d e  if you was twenty lawyers that s right  jack  said the admiral  come  mr  crinkles  i ll think for your sake  there may be two decent lawyers in the world  and you one of them  we must have a bottle of the best wine the ship i mean the house can afford together if it is your command  admiral  i obey with pleasure  said the attorney  and although i assure you  on my honour  i did not write that letter  yet some of the matters mentioned in it are so generally notorious here  that i can afford you information concerning them can you i regret to say i can  for i respect the parties sit down  then sit down  jack  run to the steward s room and get the wine  we will go into it now starboard and larboard  who the deuce could have written that letter i have not the least idea  sir well well  never mind  it has brought me here  that s something  so i won t grumble much at it  i didn t know my nephew was in england  and i dare say he didn t know i was  but here we both are  and i won t rest till i ve seen him  and ascertained how the what s its name the vampyre ah  the vampyre shiver my timbers  said jack pringle  who now brought in some wine much against the remonstrances of the waiters of the establishment  who considered that he was treading upon their vested interests by so doing shiver my timbers  if i knows what a wamphigher  is  unless he s some distant relation to davy jones hold your ignorant tongue  said the admiral  nobody wants you to make a remark  you great lubber very good  said jack  and he sat down the wine on the table  and then retired to the other end of the room  remarking to himself that he was not called a great lubber on a certain occasion  when bullets were scuttling their nobs  and they were yard arm and yard arm with god knows who now  mister lawyer  said admiral bell  who had about him a large share of the habits of a rough sailor  now  mister lawyer  here is a glass first to our better acquaintance  for d e  if i don t like you you are very good  sir not at all  there was a time  when i d just as soon have thought of asking a young shark to supper with me in my own cabin as a lawyer  but i begin to see that there may be such a thing as a decent  good sort of a fellow seen in the law  so here s good luck to you  and you shall never want a friend or a bottle while admiral bell has a shot in the locker gammon  said jack d n you  what do you mean by that  roared the admiral  in a furious tone i wasn t speaking to you  shouted jack  about two octaves higher it s two boys in the street as is pretending they re a going to fight and i know d d well they won t hold your noise i m going  i wasn t told to hold my noise  when our nobs were being scuttled off beyrout never mind him  mister lawyer  added the admiral  he don t know what he s talking about  never mind him  you go on and tell me all you know about the the the vampyre ah  i always forget the names of strange fish  i suppose  after all it s something of the mermaid order that i cannot say  sir  but certainly the story  in all its painful particulars  has made a great sensation all over the country indeed yes  sir  you shall hear how it occurred  it appears that one night miss flora bannersworth  a young lady of great beauty  and respected and admired by all who knew her was visited by a strange being who came in at the window my eye  said jack  it waren t me  i wish it had a been so petrified by fear was she  that she had only time to creep half out of the bed  and to utter one cry of alarm  when the strange visitor seized her in his grasp d n my pig tail  said jack  what a squall there must have been  to be sure do you see this bottle  roared the admiral to be sure  i does  i think as it s time i seed another you scoundrel  i ll make you feel it against that d d stupid head of yours  if you interrupt this gentleman again don t be violent well  as i was saying  continued the attorney  she did  by great good fortune  manage to scream  which had the effect of alarming the whole house  the door of her chamber  which was fast  was broken open yes  yes ah  cried jack you may imagine the horror and the consternation of those who entered the room to find her in the grasp of a fiend like figure  whose teeth were fastened on her neck  and who was actually draining her veins of blood the devil before any one could lay hands sufficiently upon the figure to detain it  it had fled precipitately from its dreadful repast  shots were fired after it in vain and they let it go they followed it  i understand  as well as they were able  and saw it scale the garden wall of the premises  there it escaped  leaving  as you may well imagine  on all their minds  a sensation of horror difficult to describe well  i never did hear anything the equal of that  jack  what do you think of it i haven t begun to think  yet  said jack but what about my nephew  charles  added the admiral of him i know nothing nothing not a word  admiral  i was not aware you had a nephew  or that any gentleman bearing that  or any other relationship to you  had any sort of connexion with these mysterious and most unaccountable circumstances i tell you all i have gathered from common report about this vampyre business  further i know not  i assure you well  a man can t tell what he don t know  it puzzles me to think who could possibly have written me this letter that i am completely at a loss to imagine  said crinkles  i assure you  my gallant sir  that i am much hurt at the circumstance of any one using my name in such a way  but  nevertheless  as you are here  permit me to say  that it will be my pride  my pleasure  and the boast of the remainder of my existence  to be of some service to so gallant a defender of my country  and one whose name  along with the memory of his deeds  is engraved upon the heart of every briton quite ekal to a book  he talks  said jack  i never could read one myself  on account o  not knowing how  but i ve heard em read  and that s just the sort o  incomprehensible gammon we don t want any of your ignorant remarks  said the admiral  so you be quiet ay  ay  sir now  mister lawyer  you are an honest fellow  and an honest fellow is generally a sensible fellow sir  i thank you if so be as what this letter says is true  my nephew charles has got a liking for this girl  who has had her neck bitten by a vampyre  you see i perceive  sir now what would you do one of the most difficult  as well  perhaps  as one of the most ungracious of tasks  said the attorney  is to interfere with family affairs  the cold and steady eye of reason generally sees things in such very different lights to what they appear to those whose feelings and whose affections are much compromised in their results very true  go on taking  my dear sir  what in my humble judgment appears to be a reasonable view of this subject  i should say it would be a dreadful thing for your nephew to marry into a family any member of which was liable to the visitations of a vampyre it wouldn t be pleasant the young lady might have children oh  lots  cried jack hold your noise  jack ay  ay  sir and she might herself actually  when after death she became a vampyre come and feed on her own children become a vampyre  what  is she going to be a vampyre too my dear sir  don t you know that it is a remarkable fact  as regards the physiology of vampyres  that whoever is bitten by one of those dreadful beings  becomes a vampyre the devil it is a fact  sir whew  whistled jack  she might bite us all  and we should be a whole ship s crew o  wamphighers  there would be a confounded go it s not pleasant  said the admiral  as he rose from his chair  and paced to and fro in the room  it s not pleasant  hang me up at my own yard arm if it is who said it was  cried jack who asked you  you brute well  sir  added mr  crinkles  i have given you all the information i can  and i can only repeat what i before had the honour of saying more at large  namely  that i am your humble servant to command  and that i shall be happy to attend upon you at any time thank ye thank ye  mr a a crinkles ah  crinkles  you shall hear from me again  sir  shortly  now that i am down here  i will see to the very bottom of this affair  were it deeper than fathom ever sounded  charles holland was my poor sister s son  he s the only relative i have in the wide world  and his happiness is dearer to my heart than my own crinkles turned aside  and  by the twinkle of his eyes  one might premise that the honest little lawyer was much affected god bless you  sir  he said  farewell good day to you good bye  lawyer  cried jack  mind how you go  d n me  if you don t seem a decent sort of fellow  and  after all  you may give the devil a clear berth  and get into heaven s straits with a flowing sheet provided as you don t  towards the end of the voyage  make any lubberly blunders the old admiral threw himself into a chair with a deep sigh jack  said he aye  aye  sir what s to be done now jack opened the window to discharge the superfluous moisture from an enormous quid he had indulged himself with while the lawyer was telling about the vampyre  and then again turning his face towards his master he said do  what shall we do  why  go at once and find out charles  our nevy and ask him all about it  and see the young lady  too  and lay hold o the wamphigher  if we can  as well  and go at the whole affair broadside to broadside  till we make a prize of all the particulars after which we can turn it over in our minds agin  and see what s to be done jack  you are right  come along i knows i am  do you know now which way to steer of course not  i never was in this latitude before  and the channel looks intricate  we will hail a pilot  jack  and then we shall be all right  and if we strike it will be his fault which is a mighty great consolation  said jack  come along chapter xvi the meeting of the lovers in the garden an affecting scene the sudden appearance of sir francis varney illustration our readers will recollect that flora bannerworth had made an appointment with charles holland in the garden of the hall  this meeting was looked forward to by the young man with a variety of conflicting feelings  and he passed the intermediate time in a most painful state of doubt as to what would be its result the thought that he should be much urged by flora to give up all thoughts of making her his  was a most bitter one to him  who loved her with so much truth and constancy  and that she would say all she could to induce such a resolution in his mind he felt certain  but to him the idea of now abandoning her presented itself in the worst of aspects shall i  he said  sink so low in my own estimation  as well as in hers  and in that of all honourable minded persons  as to desert her now in the hour of affliction  dare i be so base as actually or virtually to say to her  flora  when your beauty was undimmed by sorrow when all around you seemed life and joy  i loved you selfishly for the increased happiness which you might bestow upon me  but now the hand of misfortune presses heavily upon you you are not what you were  and i desert you never never never charles holland  it will be seen by some of our more philosophic neighbours  felt more acutely than he reasoned  but let his errors of argumentation be what they may  can we do other than admire the nobility of soul which dictated such a self denying generous course as that he was pursuing as for flora  heaven only knows if at that precise time her intellect had completely stood the test of the trying events which had nearly overwhelmed it the two grand feelings that seemed to possess her mind were fear of the renewed visit of the vampyre  and an earnest desire to release charles holland from his repeated vows of constancy towards her feeling  generosity  and judgment  all revolted holding a young man to such a destiny as hers  to link him to her fate  would be to make him to a real extent a sharer in it  and the more she heard fall from his lips in the way of generous feelings of continued attachment to her  the more severely did she feel that he would suffer most acutely if united to her and she was right  the very generosity of feeling which would have now prompted charles holland to lead flora bannerworth to the altar  even with the marks of the vampyre s teeth upon her throat  gave an assurance of a depth of feeling which would have made him an ample haven in all her miseries  in all her distresses and afflictions what was familiarly in the family at the hall called the garden  was a semicircular piece of ground shaded in several directions by trees  and which was exclusively devoted to the growth of flowers  the piece of ground was nearly hidden from the view of the house  and in its centre was a summer house  which at the usual season of the year was covered with all kinds of creeping plants of exquisite perfumes  and rare beauty  all around  too  bloomed the fairest and sweetest of flowers which a rich soil and a sheltered situation could produce alas  though  of late many weeds had straggled up among their more estimable floral culture  for the decayed fortunes of the family had prevented them from keeping the necessary servants  to place the hall and its grounds in a state of neatness  such as it had once been the pride of the inhabitants of the place to see them  it was then in this flower garden that charles and flora used to meet as may be supposed  he was on the spot before the appointed hour anxiously expecting the appearance of her who was so really and truly dear to him  what to him were the sweet flowers that there grew in such happy luxuriance and heedless beauty  alas  the flower that to his mind was fairer than them all  was blighted  and in the wan cheek of her whom he loved  he sighed to see the lily usurping the place of the radiant rose dear  dear flora  he ejaculated  you must indeed be taken from this place  which is so full of the most painful remembrance  now  i cannot think that mr  marchdale somehow is a friend to me  but that conviction or rather impression  does not paralyze my judgment sufficiently to induce me not to acknowledge that his advice is good  he might have couched it in pleasanter words words that would not  like daggers  each have brought a deadly pang home to my heart  but still i do think that in his conclusion he was right a light sound  as of some fairy footstep among the flowers  came upon his ears  and turning instantly to the direction from whence the sound proceeded  he saw what his heart had previously assured him of  namely that it was his flora who was coming illustration yes  it was she  but  ah  how pale  how wan how languid and full of the evidences of much mental suffering was she  where now was the elasticity of that youthful step  where now was that lustrous beaming beauty of mirthfulness  which was wont to dawn in those eyes alas  all was changed  the exquisite beauty of form was there  but the light of joy which had lent its most transcendent charms to that heavenly face  was gone  charles was by her side in a moment  he had her hand clasped in his  while his disengaged one was wound tenderly around her taper waist flora  dear  dear flora  he said  you are better  tell me that you feel the gentle air revives you she could not speak  her heart was too full of woe oh  flora  my own  my beautiful  he added  in those tones which come so direct from the heart  and which are so different from any assumption of tenderness  speak to me  dear  dear flora speak to me if it be but a word charles  was all she could say  and then she burst into a flood of tears  and leant so heavily upon his arm  that it was evident but for that support she must have fallen charles holland welcomed those  although  they grieved him so much that he could have accompanied them with his own  but then he knew that she would be soon now more composed  and that they would relieve the heart whose sorrows called them into existence he forbore to speak to her until he found this sudden gush of feeling was subsiding into sobs  and then in low  soft accents  he again endeavoured to breathe comfort to her afflicted and terrified spirit my flora  he said  remember that there are warm hearts that love you remember that neither time nor circumstance can change such endearing affection as mine  ah  flora  what evil is there in the whole world that love may not conquer  and in the height of its noble feelings laugh to scorn oh  hush  hush  charles  hush wherefore  flora  would you still the voice of pure affection  i love you surely  as few have ever loved  ah  why would you forbid me to give such utterance as i may to those feelings which fill up my whole heart no no no flora  flora  wherefore do you say no do not  charles  now speak to me of affection or love  do not tell me you love me now not tell you i love you  ah  flora  if my tongue  with its poor eloquence to give utterance to such a sentiment  were to do its office each feature of my face would tell the tale  each action would show to all the world how much i loved you i must not now hear this  great god of heaven give me strength to carry out the purpose of my soul what purpose is it  flora  that you have to pray thus fervently for strength to execute  oh  if it savour aught of treason against love s majesty  forget it  love is a gift from heaven  the greatest and the most glorious gift it ever bestowed upon its creatures  heaven will not aid you in repudiating that which is the one grand redeeming feature that rescues human nature from a world of reproach flora wrung her hands despairingly as she said charles  i know i cannot reason with you  i know i have not power of language  aptitude of illustration  nor depth of thought to hold a mental contention with you flora  for what do i contend you  you speak of love and i have  ere this  spoken to you of love unchecked yes  yes  before this and now  wherefore not now  do not tell me you are changed i am changed  charles  fearfully changed  the curse of god has fallen upon me  i know not why  i know not that in word or in thought i have done evil  except perchance unwittingly  and yet the vampyre let not that affright you affright me  it has killed me nay  flora you think too much of what i still hope to be susceptible of far more rational explanation by your own words  then  charles  i must convict you  i cannot  i dare not be yours  while such a dreadful circumstance is hanging over me charles  if a more rational explanation than the hideous one which my own fancy gives to the form that visits me can be found  find it  and rescue me from despair and from madness they had now reached the summer house  and as flora uttered these words she threw herself on to a seat  and covering her beautiful face with her hands  she sobbed convulsively you have spoken  said charles  dejectedly  i have heard that which you wished to say to me no  no  not all  charles i will be patient  then  although what more you may have to add should tear my very heart strings i i have to add  charles  she said  in a tremulous voice  that justice  religion  mercy every human attribute which bears the name of virtue  calls loudly upon me no longer to hold you to vows made under different auspices go on  flora i then implore you  charles  finding me what i am  to leave me to the fate which it has pleased heaven to cast upon me  i do not ask you charles  not to love me tis well  go on  flora because i should like to think that  although i might never see you more  you loved me still  but you must think seldom of me  and you must endeavour to be happy with some other you cannot  flora  pursue the picture you yourself would draw  these words come not from your heart yes yes yes did you ever love me charles  charles  why will you add another pang to those you know must already rend my heart no  flora  i would tear my own heart from my bosom ere i would add one pang to yours  well i know that gentle maiden modesty would seal your lips to the soft confession that you loved me  i could not hope the joy of hearing you utter these words  the tender devoted lover is content to see the truthful passion in the speaking eyes of beauty  content is he to translate it from a thousand acts  which  to eyes that look not so acutely as a lover s  bear no signification  but when you tell me to seek happiness with another  well may the anxious question burst from my throbbing heart of  did you ever love me  flora her senses hung entranced upon his words  oh  what a witchery is in the tongue of love  some even of the former colour of her cheek returned as forgetting all for the moment but that she was listening to the voice of him  the thoughts of whom had made up the day dream of her happiness she gazed upon his face his voice ceased  to her it seemed as if some music had suddenly left off in its most exquisite passage  she clung to his arm she looked imploringly up to him  her head sunk upon his breast as she cried charles  charles  i did love you  i do love you now then let sorrow and misfortune shake their grisly locks in vain  he cried  heart to heart hand to hand with me  defy them he lifted up his arms towards heaven as he spoke  and at the moment came such a rattling peal of thunder  that the very earth seemed to shake upon its axis a half scream of terror burst from the lips of flora  as she cried what was that only thunder  said charles  calmly twas an awful sound a natural one but at such a moment  when you were defying fate to injure us  oh charles  is it ominous flora  can you really give way to such idle fancies the sun is obscured ay  but it will shine all the brighter for its temporary eclipse  the thunder storm will clear the air of many noxious vapours  the forked lightning has its uses as well as its powers of mischief  hark  there again another peal  of almost equal intensity to the other  shook the firmament  flora trembled charles  she said  this is the voice of heaven  we must part we must part for ever  i cannot be yours flora  this is madness  think again  dear flora  misfortunes for a time will hover over the best and most fortunate of us  but  like the clouds that now obscure the sweet sunshine  will pass away  and leave no trace behind them  the sunshine of joy will shine on you again there was a small break in the clouds  like a window looking into heaven  from it streamed one beam of sunlight  so bright  so dazzling and so beautiful  that it was a sight of wonder to look upon  it fell upon the face of flora  it warmed her cheek  it lent lustre to her pale lips and tearful eyes  it illumined that little summer house as if it had been the shrine of some saint behold  cried charles  where is your omen now god of heaven  cried flora  and she stretched out her arms the clouds that hover over your spirit now  said charles  shall pass away  accept this beam of sunlight as a promise from god i will i will  it is going it has done its office the clouds closed over the small orifice  and all was gloom again as before flora  said charles  you will not ask me now to leave you she allowed him to clasp her to his heart  it was beating for her  and for her only you will let me  flora  love you still her voice  as she answered him  was like the murmur of some distant melody the ears can scarcely translate to the heart charles we will live  love  and die together and now there was a wrapt stillness in that summer house for many minutes a trance of joy  they did not speak  but now and then she would look into his face with an old familiar smile  and the joy of his heart was near to bursting in tears from his eyes a shriek burst from flora s lips a shriek so wild and shrill that it awakened echoes far and near  charles staggered back a step  as if shot and then in such agonised accents as he was long indeed in banishing the remembrance of  she cried the vampyre  the vampyre chapter xvii the explanation the arrival of the admiral at the house a scene of confusion  and some of its results illustration so sudden and so utterly unexpected a cry of alarm from flora  at such a time might well have the effect of astounding the nerves of any one  and no wonder that charles was for a few seconds absolutely petrified and almost unable to think mechanically  then  he turned his eyes towards the door of the summer house  and there he saw a tall  thin man  rather elegantly dressed  whose countenance certainly  in its wonderful resemblance to the portrait on the panel  might well appal any one the stranger stood in the irresolute attitude on the threshold of the summer house of one who did not wish to intrude  but who found it as awkward  if not more so now  to retreat than to advance before charles holland could summon any words to his aid  or think of freeing himself from the clinging grasp of flora  which was wound around him  the stranger made a very low and courtly bow  after which he said in winning accents i very much fear that i am an intruder here  allow me to offer my warmest apologies  and to assure you  sir  and you  madam  that i had no idea any one was in the arbour  you perceive the rain is falling smartly  and i made towards here  seeing it was likely to shelter me from the shower these words were spoken in such a plausible and courtly tone of voice that they might well have become any drawing room in the kingdom flora kept her eyes fixed upon him during the utterance of these words and as she convulsively clutched the arm of charles  she kept on whispering the vampyre  the vampyre i much fear  added the stranger  in the same bland tones  that i have been the cause of some alarm to the young lady release me  whispered charles to flora  release me  i will follow him at once no  no do not leave me do not leave me  the vampyre the dreadful vampyre but  flora hush hush hush  it speaks again perhaps i ought to account for my appearance in the garden at all added the insinuating stranger  the fact is  i came on a visit flora shuddered to mr  henry bannerworth  continued the stranger  and finding the garden gate open  i came in without troubling the servants  which i much regret  as i can perceive i have alarmed and annoyed the lady  madam pray accept of my apologies in the name of god  who are you  said charles my name is varney oh  yes  you are the sir francis varney  residing close by  who bears so fearful a resemblance to pray go on  sir  i am all attention to a portrait here indeed  now i reflect a moment  mr  henry bannerworth did incidentally mention something of the sort  it s a most singular coincidence the sound of approaching footsteps was now plainly heard  and in a few moments henry and george  along with mr  marchdale  reached the spot their appearance showed that they had made haste  and henry at once exclaimed we heard  or fancied we heard  a cry of alarm you did hear it  said charles holland  do you know this gentleman it is sir francis varney indeed varney bowed to the new comers  and was altogether as much at his ease as everybody else seemed quite the contrary  even charles holland found the difficulty of going up to such a well bred  gentlemanly man  and saying  sir  we believe you to be a vampyre to be almost  if not insurmountable i cannot do it  he thought  but i will watch him take me away  whispered flora  tis he tis he  oh  take me away charles hush  flora  hush  you are in some error  the accidental resemblance should not make us be rude to this gentleman the vampyre it is the vampyre are you sure  flora do i know your features my own my brother s  do not ask me to doubt i cannot  i am quite sure  take me from his hideous presence charles the young lady  i fear  is very much indisposed  remarked sir francis varney  in a sympathetic tone of voice  if she will accept of my arm  i shall esteem it a great honour no no no god  no  cried flora madam  i will not press you he bowed  and charles led flora from the summer house towards the hall flora  he said  i am bewildered i know not what to think  that man most certainly has been fashioned after the portrait which is on the panel in the room you formerly occupied  or it has been painted from him he is my midnight visitor  exclaimed flora  he is the vampyre this sir francis varney is the vampyre good god  what can be done i know not  i am nearly distracted be calm  flora  if this man be really what you name him  we now know from what quarter the mischief comes  which is  at all events  a point gained  be assured we shall place a watch upon him oh  it is terrible to meet him here and he is so wonderfully anxious  too  to possess the hall he is he is it looks strange  the whole affair  but  flora  be assured of one thing  and that is  of your own safety can i be assured of that most certainly  go to your mother now  here we are  you see  fairly within doors  go to your mother  dear flora  and keep yourself quiet  i will return to this mysterious man now with a cooler judgment than i left him you will watch him  charles i will  indeed and you will not let him approach the house here alone i will not oh  that the almighty should allow such beings to haunt the earth hush  flora  hush  we cannot judge of his allwise purpose tis hard that the innocent should be inflicted with its presence charles bowed his head in mournful assent illustration is it not very  very dreadful hush hush  calm yourself  dearest  calm yourself  recollect that all we have to go upon in this matter is a resemblance  which  after all may be accidental  but leave it all to me  and be assured that now i have some clue to this affair  i will not lose sight of it  or of sir francis varney so saying  charles surrendered flora to the care of her mother  and then was hastening back to the summer house  when he met the whole party coming towards the hall  for the rain was each moment increasing in intensity we are returning  remarked sir francis varney  with a half bow and a smile  to charles allow me  said henry  to introduce you  mr  holland  to our neighbour  sir francis varney charles felt himself compelled to behave with courtesy  although his mind was so full of conflicting feelings as regarded varney  but there was no avoiding  without such brutal rudeness as was inconsistent with all his pursuits and habits  replying in something like the same strain to the extreme courtly politeness of the supposed vampyre i will watch him closely  thought charles  i can do no more than watch him closely sir francis varney seemed to be a man of the most general and discursive information  he talked fluently and pleasantly upon all sorts of topics and notwithstanding he could not but have heard what flora had said of him  he asked no questions whatever upon that subject this silence as regarded a matter which would at once have induced some sort of inquiry from any other man  charles felt told much against him and he trembled to believe for a moment that  after all  it really might be true is he a vampyre  he asked himself  are there vampyres  and is this man of fashion this courtly  talented  educated gentleman one  it was a perfectly hideous question you are charmingly situated here  remarked varney  as  after ascending the few steps that led to the hall door  he turned and looked at the view from that slight altitude the place has been much esteemed  said henry  for its picturesque beauties of scenery and well it may be  i trust  mr  holland  the young lady is much better she is  sir  said charles i was not honoured by an introduction it was my fault  said henry  who spoke to his extraordinary guest with an air of forced hilarity  it was my fault for not introducing you to my sister and that was your sister it was  sir report has not belied her she is beautiful  but she looks rather pale i thought  has she bad health the best of health indeed  perhaps the little disagreeable circumstance  which is made so much food for gossip in the neighbourhood  has affected her spirits it has you allude to the supposed visit here of a vampyre  said charles  as he fixed his eyes upon varney s face yes  i allude to the supposed appearance of a supposed vampyre in this family  said sir francis varney  as he returned the earnest gaze of charles  with such unshrinking assurance  that the young man was compelled  after about a minute  nearly to withdraw his own eyes he will not be cowed  thought charles  use has made him familiar to such cross questioning it appeared now suddenly to occur to henry that he had said something at varney s own house which should have prevented him from coming to the hall  and he now remarked we scarcely expected the pleasure of your company here  sir francis varney oh  my dear sir  i am aware of that  but you roused my curiosity  you mentioned to me that there was a portrait here amazingly like me did i indeed you did  or how could i know it  i wanted to see if the resemblance was so perfect did you hear  sir  added henry  that my sister was alarmed at your likeness to that portrait no  really i pray you walk in  and we will talk more at large upon that matter with great pleasure  one leads a monotonous life in the country  when compared with the brilliancy of a court existence  just now i have no particular engagement  as we are near neighbours i see no reason why we should not be good friends  and often interchange such civilities as make up the amenities of existence  and which  in the country  more particularly  are valuable henry could not be hypocrite enough to assent to this  but still  under the present aspect of affairs  it was impossible to return any but a civil reply  so he said oh  yes  of course certainly  my time is very much occupied  and my sister and mother see no company oh  now  how wrong wrong  sir yes  surely  if anything more than another tends to harmonize individuals  it is the society of that fairer half of the creation which we love for their very foibles  i am much attached to the softer sex to young persons full of health  i like to see the rosy checks  where the warm blood mantles in the superficial veins  and all is loveliness and life charles shrank back  and the word demon  unconsciously escaped his lips sir francis took no manner of notice of the expression  but went on talking  as if he had been on the very happiest terms with every one present will you follow me  at once  to the chamber where the portrait hangs said henry  or will you partake of some refreshment first no refreshment for me  said varney  my dear friend  if you will permit me to call you such  this is a time of the day at which i never do take any refreshment nor at any other  thought henry they all went to the chamber where charles had passed one very disagreeable night  and when they arrived  henry pointed to the portrait on the panel  saying there  sir francis varney  is your likeness he looked  and  having walked up to it  in an under tone  rather as if he were conversing with himself than making a remark for any one else to hear  he said it is wonderfully like it is  indeed  said charles if i stand beside it  thus  said varney  placing himself in a favourable attitude for comparing the two faces  i dare say you will be more struck with the likeness than before so accurate was it now  that the same light fell upon his face as that under which the painter had executed the portrait  that all started back a step or two some artists  remarked varney  have the sense to ask where a portrait is to be hung before they paint it  and then they adapt their lights and shadows to those which would fall upon the original  were it similarly situated i cannot stand this  said charles to henry  i must question him farther as you please  but do not insult him i will not he is beneath my roof now  and  after all  it is but a hideous suspicion we have of him rely upon me charles stepped forward  and once again confronting varney  with an earnest gaze  he said do you know  sir  that miss bannerworth declares the vampyre she fancies to have visited this chamber to be  in features  the exact counterpart of this portrait does she indeed she does  indeed and perhaps  then  that accounts for her thinking that i am the vampyre  because i bear a strong resemblance to the portrait i should not be surprised  said charles how very odd very and yet entertaining  i am rather amused than otherwise  the idea of being a vampyre  ha  ha  if ever i go to a masquerade again  i shall certainly assume the character of a vampyre you would do it well i dare say  now  i should make quite a sensation i am certain you would  do you not think  gentlemen  that sir francis varney would enact the character to the very life  by heavens  he would do it so well that one might  without much difficulty  really imagine him a vampyre bravo bravo  said varney  as he gently folded his hands together with that genteel applause that may even be indulged in in a box at the opera itself  bravo  i like to see young persons enthusiastic  it looks as if they had some of the real fire of genius in their composition bravo bravo this was  charles thought  the very height and acme of impudence  and yet what could he do  what could he say  he was foiled by the downright coolness of varney as for henry  george  and mr  marchdale  they had listened to what was passing between sir francis and charles in silence  they feared to diminish the effect of anything charles might say  by adding a word of their own  and  likewise  they did not wish to lose one observation that might come from the lips of varney but now charles appeared to have said all he had to say  he turned to the window and looked out  he seemed like a man who had made up his mind  for a time  to give up some contest in which he had been engaged and  perhaps  not so much did he give it up from any feeling or consciousness of being beaten  as from a conviction that it could be the more effectually  at some other and far more eligible opportunity renewed varney now addressed henry  saying i presume the subject of our conference  when you did me the honour of a call  is no secret to any one here none whatever  said henry then  perhaps  i am too early in asking you if you have made up your mind i have scarcely  certainly  had time to think my dear sir  do not let me hurry you  i much regret  indeed  the intrusion you seem anxious to possess the hall  remarked mr  marchdale  to varney i am is it new to you not quite  i have some boyish recollections connected with this neighbourhood  among which bannerworth hall stands sufficiently prominent may i ask how long ago that was  said charles howard  rather abruptly i do not recollect  my enthusiastic young friend  said varney  how old are you just about twenty one you are  then  for your age  quite a model of discretion it would have been difficult for the most accurate observer of human nature to have decided whether this was said truthfully or ironically so charles made no reply to it whatever i trust  said henry  we shall induce you  as this is your first visit  sir francis varney  to the hall  to partake of some thing well  well  a cup of wine is at your service henry now led the way to a small parlour  which  although by no means one of the showiest rooms of the house  was  from the care and exquisite carving with which it abounded  much more to the taste of any who possessed an accurate judgment in such works of art then wine was ordered  and charles took an opportunity of whispering to henry notice well if he drinks i will do you see that beneath his coat there is a raised place  as if his arm was bound up i do there  then  was where the bullet from the pistol fired by flora  when we were at the church  hit him hush  for god s sake  hush  you are getting into a dreadful state of excitement  charles  hush  hush and can you blame no  no  but what can we do you are right  nothing can we do at present  we have a clue now  and be it our mutual inclination  as well as duty  to follow it  oh  you shall see how calm i will be for heaven s sake  be so  i have noted that his eyes flash upon yours with no friendly feeling his friendship were a curse hush  he drinks watch him i will gentlemen all  said sir francis varney  in such soft  dulcet tones that it was quite a fascination to hear him speak  gentlemen all  being as i am  much delighted with your company  do not accuse me of presumption  if i drink now  poor drinker as i am  to our future merry meetings he raised the wine to his lips  and seemed to drink  after which he replaced the glass upon the table charles glanced at it  it was still full you have not drank  sir francis varney  he said pardon me  enthusiastic young sir  said varney  perhaps you will have the liberality to allow me to take my wine how i please and when i please your glass is full well  sir will you drink it not at any man s bidding  most certainly  if the fair flora bannerworth would grace the board with her sweet presence  methinks i could then drink on  on  on hark you  sir  cried charles  i can bear no more of this  we have had in this house most horrible and damning evidence that there are such things as vampyres have you really  i suppose you eat raw pork at supper  and so had the nightmare a jest is welcome in its place  but pray hear me out  sir  if it suit your lofty courtesy to do so oh  certainly then i say we believe  as far as human judgment has a right to go  that a vampyre has been here go on  it s interesting  i always was a lover of the wild and the wonderful we have  too  continued charles  some reason to believe that you are the man varney tapped his forehead as he glanced at henry  and said oh  dear  i did not know  you should have told me he was a little wrong about the brain  i might have quarreled with the lad  dear me  how lamentable for his poor mother this will not do  sir francis varney alias  bannerworth oh oh  be calm be calm i defy you to your teeth  sir  no  god  no  your teeth poor lad  poor lad you are a cowardly demon  and here i swear to devote myself to your destruction sir francis varney drew himself up to his full height  and that was immense  as he said to henry i pray you  mr  bannerworth  since i am thus grievously insulted beneath your roof  to tell me if your friend here be mad or sane he s not mad then hold  sir  the quarrel shall be mine  in the name of my persecuted sister in the name of heaven  sir francis varney  i defy you sir francis  in spite of his impenetrable calmness  appeared somewhat moved  as he said i have already endured insult sufficient i will endure no more  if there are weapons at hand my young friend  interrupted mr  marchdale  stepping between the excited men  is carried away by his feelings  and knows not what he says  you will look upon it in that light  sir francis we need no interference  exclaimed varney  his hitherto bland voice changing to one of fury  the hot blooded fool wishes to fight  and he shall to the death to the death illustration and i say he shall not  exclaimed mr  marchdale  taking henry by the arm  george  he added  turning to the young man  assist me in persuading your brother to leave the room  conceive the agony of your sister and mother if anything should happen to him varney smiled with a devilish sneer  as he listened to these words  and then he said as you will as you will  there will be plenty of time  and perhaps better opportunity  gentlemen  i bid you good day and with provoking coolness  he then moved towards the door  and quitted the room remain here  said marchdale  i will follow him  and see that he quits the premises he did so  and the young men  from the window  beheld sir francis walking slowly across the garden  and then saw mr  marchdale follow on his track while they were thus occupied  a tremendous ringing came at the gate but their attention was so rivetted to what was passing in the garden that they paid not the least attention to it chapter xviii the admiral s advice the challenge to the vampyre the new servant at the hall illustration the violent ringing of the bell continued uninterruptedly until at length george volunteered to answer it  the fact was  that now there was no servant at all in the place for  after the one who had recently demanded of henry her dismissal had left  the other was terrified to remain alone  and had precipitately gone from the house  without even going through the ceremony of announcing her intention to  to be sure she sent a boy for her money afterwards  which may be considered a great act of condescension suspecting  then  this state of things  george himself hastened to the gate  and  being not over well pleased at the continuous and unnecessary ringing which was kept up at it  he opened it quickly  and cried  with more impatience  by a vast amount  than was usual with him who is so impatient that he cannot wait a seasonable time for the door to be opened and who the d l are you  cried one who was immediately outside who do you want  cried george shiver my timbers  cried admiral bell  for it was no other than that personage  what s that to you ay  ay  added jack  answer that if you can  you shore going looking swab two madmen  i suppose  ejaculated george  and he would have closed the gate upon them  but jack introduced between it and the post the end of a thick stick  saying avast there  none of that  we have had trouble enough to get in  if you are the family lawyer  or the chaplain  perhaps you ll tell us where mister charley is once more i demand of you who you want  said george  who was now perhaps a little amused at the conduct of the impatient visitors we want the admiral s nevey  said jack but how do i know who is the admiral s nevey  as you call him why  charles holland  to be sure  have you got him aboard or not mr  charles holland is certainly here  and  if you had said at once and explicitly  that you wished to see him  i could have given you a direct answer he is here  cried the admiral most certainly come along  then  yet  stop a bit  i say  young fellow  just before we go any further  tell us if he has maimed the vampyre the what the wamphigher  said jack  by way of being  as he considered  a little more explanatory than the admiral i do not know what you mean  said george  if you wish to see mr charles holland walk in and see him  he is in this house  but  for myself  as you are strangers to me  i decline answering any questions let their import be what they may hilloa  who are they  suddenly cried jack  as he pointed to two figures some distance off in the meadows  who appeared to be angrily conversing george glanced in the direction towards which jack pointed  and there he saw sir francis varney and mr  marchdale standing within a few paces of each other  and apparently engaged in some angry discussion his first impulse was to go immediately towards them  but  before he could execute even that suggestion of his mind  he saw varney strike marchdale  and the latter fell to the ground allow me to pass  cried george  as he endeavoured to get by the rather unwieldy form of the admiral  but  before he could accomplish this  for the gate was narrow  he saw varney  with great swiftness  make off  and marchdale  rising to his feet  came towards the hall when marchdale got near enough to the garden gate to see george  he motioned to him to remain where he was  and then  quickening his pace he soon came up to the spot marchdale  cried george  you have had an encounter with sir francis varney i have  said marchdale  in an excited manner  i threatened to follow him  but he struck me to the earth as easily as i could a child  his strength is superhuman i saw you fall i believe  but that he was observed  he would have murdered me indeed what  do you mean to say that lankey  horse marine looking fellow is as bad as that  said the admiral marchdale now turned his attention to the two new comers  upon whom he looked with some surprise  and then  turning to george  he said is this gentleman a visitor to mr  holland  i believe he is  said george  but i have not the pleasure of knowing his name oh  you may know my name as soon as you like  cried the admiral  the enemies of old england know it  and i don t care if all the world knows it  i m old admiral bell  something of a hulk now  but still able to head a quarter deck if there was any need to do so ay  ay  cried jack  and taking from his pocket a boatswain s whistle he blew a blast so long  and loud  and shrill  that george was fain to cover his ears with his hands to shut out the brain piercing  and  to him unusual sound and are you  then  a relative  said marchdale  of mr  holland s  sir may i ask i m his uncle  and be d d to him  if you must know  and some one has told me that the young scamp thinks of marrying a mermaid  or a ghost or a vampyre  or some such thing  so  for the sake of the memory of his poor mother  i ve come to say no to the bargain  and d n me  who cares come in  sir  said george  i will conduct you to mr  holland  i presume this is your servant why  not exactly  that s jack pringle  he was my boatswain  you see and now he s a kind o  something betwixt and between  not exactly a servant ay  ay  sir  said jack  have it all your own way  though we is paid off hold your tongue  you audacious scoundrel  will you oh  i forgot  you don t like anything said about paying off  cos it puts you in mind of now  d n you  i ll have you strung up to the yard arm  you dog  if you don t belay there i m done  all s right by this time the party  including the admiral  jack  george bannerworth and marchdale  had got more than half way across the garden  and were observed by charles holland and henry  who had come to the steps of the hall to see what was going on  the moment charles saw the admiral a change of colour came over his face  and he exclaimed by all that s surprising  there is my uncle your uncle  said henry yes  as good a hearted a man as ever drew breath  and yet  withal  as full of prejudices  and as ignorant of life  as a child without waiting for any reply from henry  charles holland rushed forward  and seizing his uncle by the hand  he cried  in tones of genuine affection uncle  dear uncle  how came you to find me out charley  my boy  cried the old man  bless you  i mean  confound your d d impudence  you rascal  i m glad to see you  no  i ain t  you young mutineer  what do you mean by it  you ugly  ill looking  d d fine fellow my dear boy  oh  you infernal scoundrel all this was accompanied by a shaking of the hand  which was enough to dislocate anybody s shoulder  and which charles was compelled to bear as well as he could it quite prevented him from speaking  however  for a few moments  for it nearly shook the breath out of him  when  then  he could get in a word he said uncle  i dare say you are surprised surprised  d n me  i am surprised well  i shall be able to explain all to your satisfaction  i am sure allow me now to introduce you to my friends turning then to henry  charles said this is mr  henry bannerworth  uncle  and this mr  george bannerworth both good friends of mine  and this is mr  marchdale  a friend of theirs  uncle oh  indeed and here you see admiral bell  my most worthy  but rather eccentric uncle confound your impudence what brought him here i cannot tell  but he is a brave officer  and a gentleman none of your nonsense  said the admiral and here you sees jack pringle  said that individual  introducing himself  since no one appeared inclined to do that office for him  a tar for all weathers  one as hates the french  and is never so happy as when he s alongside o  some o  those lubberly craft blazing away that s uncommonly true  remarked the admiral will you walk in  sir  said henry  courteously  any friend of charles holland s is most welcome here  you will have much to excuse us for because we are deficient in servants at present  in consequence of come occurrences in our family  which your nephew has our full permission to explain to you in full oh  very good  i tell you what it is  all of you  what i ve seen of you  d e  i like  so here goes  come along  jack the admiral walked into the house  and as he went  charles holland said to him how came you to know i was here  uncle some fellow wrote me a despatch indeed yes  saying at you was a going to marry some odd sort of fish as it wasn t at all the thing to introduce into the family was was a vampyre mentioned that s the very thing hush  uncle hush what for do not  i implore  hint at such a thing before these kind friends of mine  i will take an opportunity within the next hour of explaining all to you  and you shall form your own kind and generous judgement upon circumstances in which my honour and my happiness are so nearly concerned gammon  said the admiral what  uncle oh  i know you want to palaver me into saying it s all right  i suppose if my judgment and generosity don t like it  i shall be an old fool  and a cursed goose now  uncle now  nevey well  well no more at present  we will talk over this at leisure  you promise me to say nothing about it until you have heard my explanation uncle very good  make it as soon as you can  and as short as you can  that s all i ask of you i will  i will charles was to the full as anxious as his uncle could be to enter upon the subject  some remote information of which  he felt convinced  had brought the old man down to the hall  who it could have been that so far intermeddled with his affairs as to write to him  he could not possibly conceive a very few words will suffice to explain the precise position in which charles holland was  a considerable sum of money had been left to him but it was saddled with the condition that he should not come into possession of it until he was one year beyond the age which is usually denominated that of discretion  namely  twenty one  his uncle  the admiral  was the trustee of his fortune  and he  with rare discretion had got the active and zealous assistance of a professional gentleman of great honour and eminence to conduct the business for him this gentleman had advised that for the two years between the ages of twenty and twenty two  charles holland should travel  inasmuch as in english society he would find himself in an awkward position  being for one whole year of age  and yet waiting for his property under such circumstances  reasoned the lawyer  a young man  unless he is possessed of very rare discretion indeed  is almost sure to get fearfully involved with money lenders  being of age  his notes  and bills  and bonds would all be good  and he would be in a ten times worse situation than a wealthy minor all this was duly explained to charles  who  rather eagerly than otherwise  caught at the idea of a two years wander on the continent where he could visit so many places  which to a well read young man like himself  and one of a lively imagination  were full of the most delightful associations but the acquaintance with flora bannerworth effected a great revolution in his feelings  the dearest  sweetest spot on earth became that which she inhabited  when the bannerworths left him abroad  he knew not what to do with himself  everything  and every pursuit in which he had before taken a delight  became most distasteful to him  he was  in fact  in a short time  completely used up  and then he determined upon returning to england  and finding out the dear object of his attachment at once this resolution was no sooner taken  than his health and spirits returned to him  and with what rapidity he could  he now made his way to his native shores the two years were so nearly expired  that he made up his mind he would not communicate either with his uncle  the admiral  or the professional gentleman upon whose judgment he set so high and so just a value  and at the hall he considered he was in perfect security from any interruption and so he would have been  but for that letter which was written to admiral bell  and signed josiah crinkles  but which josiah crinkles so emphatically denied all knowledge of  who wrote it  remains at present one of those mysteries which time  in the progress of our narrative will clear up the opportune  or rather the painful juncture at which charles holland had arrived at bannerworth hall  we are well cognisant of  where he expected to find smiles he found tears  and the family with whom he had fondly hoped he should pass a time of uninterrupted happiness  he found plunged in the gloom incidental to an occurrence of the most painful character our readers will perceive  too  that coming as he did with an utter disbelief in the vampyre  charles had been compelled  in some measure to yield to the overwhelming weight of evidence which had been brought to bear upon the subject  and although he could not exactly be said to believe in the existence and the appearance of the vampyre at bannerworth hall  he was upon the subject in a most painful state of doubt and indecision charles now took an opportunity to speak to henry privately  and inform him exactly how he stood with his uncle  adding now  my dear friend  if you forbid me  i will not tell my uncle of this sad affair  but i must own i would rather do so fully and freely  and trust to his own judgment upon it i implore you to do so  said henry  conceal nothing  let him know the precise situation and circumstances of the family by all means  there is nothing so mischievous as secrecy  i have the greatest dislike to it  i beg you tell him all i will  and with it  henry  i will tell him that my heart is irrevocably flora s your generous clinging to one whom your heart saw and loved  under very different auspices  said henry  believe me  charles  sinks deep into my heart  she has related to me something of a meeting she had with you oh  henry  she may tell you what i said  but there are no words which can express the depth of my tenderness  tis only time which can prove how much i love her go to your uncle  said henry  in a voice of emotion  god bless you charles  it is true you would have been fully justified in leaving my sister  but the nobler and the more generous path you have chosen has endeared you to us all where is flora now  said charles she is in her own room  i have persuaded her  by some occupation  to withdraw her mind from a too close and consequently painful contemplation of the distressing circumstances in which she feels herself placed you are right  what occupation best pleases her the pages of romance once had a charm for her gentle spirit then come with me  and  from among the few articles i brought with me here  i can find some papers which may help her to pass some merry hours charles took henry to his room  and  unstrapping a small valise  he took from it some manuscript papers  one of which he handed to henry saying give that to her  it contains an account of a wild adventure  and shows that human nature may suffer much more and that wrongfully too than came ever under our present mysterious affliction i will  said henry  and  coming from you  i am sure it will have a more than ordinary value in her eyes i will now  said charles  seek my uncle  i will tell him how i love her  and at the end of my narration  if he should not object  i would fain introduce her to him  that he might himself see that  let what beauty may have met his gaze  her peer he never yet met with  and may in vain hope to do so you are partial  charles not so  tis true i look upon her with a lover s eyes  but i look still with those of truthful observation well  i will speak to her about seeing your uncle  and let you know  no doubt  he will not be at all averse to an interview with any one who stands high in your esteem the young men now separated henry  to seek his beautiful sister  and charles  to communicate to his uncle the strange particulars connected with varney  the vampyre chapter xix flora in her chamber her fears the manuscript an adventure illustration henry found flora in her chamber  she was in deep thought when he tapped at the door of the room  and such was the state of nervous excitement in which she was that even the demand for admission made by him to the room was sufficient to produce from her a sudden cry of alarm who who is there  she then said  in accents full of terror tis i  dear flora  said henry she opened the door in an instant  and  with a feeling of grateful relief  exclaimed oh  henry  is it only you who did you suppose it was  flora she shuddered i i do not know  but i am so foolish now  and so weak spirited  that the slightest noise is enough to alarm me you must  dear flora  fight up  as i had hoped you were doing  against this nervousness i will endeavour  did not some strangers come a short time since brother strangers to us  flora  but not to charles holland  a relative of his an uncle whom he much respects  has found him out here  and has now come to see him and to advise him  said flora  as she sunk into a chair  and wept bitterly  to advise him  of course  to desert  as he would a pestilence  a vampyre bride hush  hush  for the sake of heaven  never make use of such a phrase flora  you know not what a pang it brings to my heart to hear you oh  forgive me  brother say no more of it  flora  heed it not  it may be possible in fact  it may well be supposed as more than probable that the relative of charles holland may shrink from sanctioning the alliance  but do you rest securely in the possession of the heart which i feel convinced is wholly yours  and which  i am sure  would break ere it surrendered you a smile of joy came across flora s pale but beautiful face  as she cried and you  dear brother you think so much of charles s faith as heaven is my judge  i do then i will bear up with what strength god may give me against all things that seek to depress me  i will not be conquered you are right  flora  i rejoice to find in you such a disposition  here is some manuscript which charles thinks will amuse you  and he bade me ask you if you would be introduced to his uncle yes  yes willingly i will tell him so  i know he wishes it  and i will tell him so  be patient  dear flora  and all may yet be well but  brother  on your sacred word  tell me do you not think this sir francis varney is the vampyre i know not what to think  and do not press me for a judgment now  he shall be watched henry left his sister  and she sat for some moments in silence with the papers before her that charles had sent her yes  she then said  gently  he loves me charles loves me  i ought to be very  very happy  he loves me  in those words are concentrated a whole world of joy charles loves me he will not forsake me  oh  was there ever such dear love such fond devotion never  never  dear charles  he loves me he loves me the very repetition of these words had a charm for flora a charm which was sufficient to banish much sorrow  even the much dreaded vampyre was forgotten while the light of love was beaming upon her  and she told herself he is mine he is mine  he loves me truly after a time  she turned to the manuscript which her brother had brought her  and  with a far greater concentration of mind than she had thought it possible she could bring to it  considering the many painful subjects of contemplation that she might have occupied herself with  she read the pages with very great pleasure and interest the tale was one which chained her attention both by its incidents and the manner of its recital  it commenced as follows  and was entitled hugo de verole  or  the double plot in a very mountainous part of hungary lived a nobleman whose paternal estates covered many a mile of rock and mountain land  as well as some fertile valleys  in which reposed a hardy and contented peasantry  the old count de hugo de verole had quitted life early  and had left his only son  the then count hugo de verole  a boy of scarcely ten years under the guardianship of his mother  an arbitrary and unscrupulous woman the count  her husband  had been one of those quiet  even tempered men who have no desire to step beyond the sphere in which they are placed he had no cares  save those included in the management of his estate the prosperity of his serfs  and the happiness of those  around him his death caused much lamentation throughout his domains  it was so sudden and unexpected  being in the enjoyment of his health and strength until a few hours previous  and then his energies became prostrated by pain and disease  there was a splendid funeral ceremony  which according to the usages of his house  took place by torch light so great and rapid were the ravages of disease  that the count s body quickly became a mass of corruption  all were amazed at the phenomena and were heartily glad when the body was disposed of in the place prepared for its reception in the vaults of his own castle  the guests who came to witness the funeral  and attend the count s obsequies  and to condole with the widow on the loss she had sustained  were entertained sumptuously for many days the widow sustained her part well  she was inconsolable for the loss of her husband  and mourned his death bitterly  her grief appeared profound  but she  with difficulty  subdued it to within decent bounds that she might not offend any of her numerous guests however  they left her with the assurances of their profound regard  and then when they were gone  when the last guest had departed  and were no longer visible to the eye of the countess  as she gazed from the battlements  then her behaviour changed totally she descended from the battlements  and then with an imperious gesture she gave her orders that all the gates of the castle should be closed and a watch set  all signs of mourning she ordered to be laid on one side save her own  which she wore  and then she retired to her own apartment  where she remained unseen here the countess remained in profound meditation for nearly two days during which time the attendants believed she was praying for the welfare of the soul of their deceased master  and they feared she would starve herself to death if she remained any longer just as they had assembled together for the purpose of either recalling her from her vigils or breaking open the door  they were amazed to see the countess open the room door  and stand in the midst of them what do you here  she demanded  in a stern voice the servants were amazed and terrified at her contracted brow  and forgot to answer the question she put to them what do you do here we came  my lady  to see see if if you were well and why because we hadn t seen your ladyship these two days  and we thought that your grief was so excessive that we feared some harm might befall you the countess s brows contracted for a few seconds  and she was about to make a hasty reply  but she conquered the desire to do so  and merely said i am not well  i am faint  but  had i been dying  i should not have thanked you for interfering to prevent me  however  you acted for the best  but do so no more  now prepare me some food the servants  thus dismissed  repaired to their stations  but with such a degree of alacrity  that they sufficiently showed how much they feared their mistress the young count  who was only in his sixth year  knew little about the loss he had sustained  but after a day or two s grief  there was an end of his sorrow for the time that night there came to the castle gate a man dressed in a black cloak attended by a servant  they were both mounted on good horses  and they demanded to be admitted to the presence of the countess de hugo de verole the message was carried to the countess  who started  but said admit the stranger accordingly the stranger was admitted  and shown into the apartment where the countess was sitting at a signal the servants retired  leaving the countess and the stranger alone  it was some moments ere they spoke  and then the countess said in a low tone you are come i am come you cannot now  you see  perform your threat  my husband  the count caught a putrid disease  and he is no more i cannot indeed do what i intended  inform your husband of your amours but i can do something as good  and which will give you as much annoyance indeed aye  more  it will cause you to be hated  i can spread reports you can and these may ruin you they may what do you intend to do  do you intend that i shall be an enemy or a friend  i can be either  according to my will what  do you desire to be either  inquired the countess  with a careless tone if you refuse my terms  you can make me an implacable enemy  and if you grant them  you can make me a useful friend and auxiliary  said the stranger what would you do if you were my enemy  inquired the countess it is hardly my place  said the stranger  to furnish you with a knowledge of my intentions  but i will say this much  that the bankrupt count of morven is your lover well and in the second place  that you were the cause of the death of your husband how dare you  sir i dare say so much  and i dare say  also  that the count of morven bought the drug of me  and that he gave it to you  and that you gave it to the count your husband and what could you do if you were my friend  inquired the countess  in the same tone  and without emotion i should abstain from doing all this  should be able to put any one else out of your way for you  when you get rid of this count of morven as you assuredly will  for i know him too well not to be sure of that get rid of him exactly  in the same manner you got rid of the old count then i accept your terms it is agreed  then yes  quite well  then  you must order me some rooms in a tower  where i can pursue my studies in quiet you will be seen and noticed all will be discovered no  indeed  i will take care of that  i can so far disguise myself that he will not recognise me  and you can give out i am a philosopher or necromancer  or what you will  no one will come to me they will be terrified very well and the gold shall be forthcoming as soon as i can get it  the count has placed all his gold in safe keeping  and all i can seize are the rents as they become due very well  but let me have them  in the meantime you must provide for me  as i have come here with the full intention of staying here  or in some neighbouring town indeed yes  and my servant must be discharged  as i want none here the countess called to an attendant and gave the necessary orders  and afterwards remained some time with the stranger  who had thus so unceremoniously thrust himself upon her  and insisted upon staying under such strange and awful circumstances                                    the count of morven came a few weeks after  and remained some days with the countess  they were ceremonious and polite until they had a moment to retire from before people  when the countess changed her cold disdain to a cordial and familiar address and now  my dear morven  she exclaimed  as soon as they were unobserved and now  my dear morven  that we are not seen  tell me what have you been doing with yourself why  i have been in some trouble  i never had gold that would stay by me  you know my hand was always open the old complaint again no  but having come to the end of my store  i began to grow serious ah  morven  said the countess  reproachfully well  never mind  when my purse is low my spirits sink  as the mercury does with the cold  you used to say my spirits were mercurial i think they were well  what did you do oh  nothing was that what you were about to tell me  inquired the countess oh  dear  no  you recollect the italian quack of whom i bought the drug you gave to the count  and which put an end to his days he wanted more money  well  as i had no more to spare  i could spare no more to him and he turned vicious  and threatened  i threatened  too  and he knew i was fully able and willing to perform any promise i might make to him on that score  i endeavoured to catch him  as he had already began to set people off on the suspicious and marvellous concerning me  and if i could have come across him  i would have laid him very low indeed and you could not find him no  i could not illustration well  then  i will tell you where he is at this present moment you yes  i i can scarcely credit my senses at what you say  said count morven my worthy doctor  you are little better than a candidate for divine honours  but where is he will you promise to be guided by me  said the countess if you make it a condition upon which you grant the information  i must well  then  i take that as a promise you may  where oh  where is he remember your promise  your doctor is at this moment in this castle this castle yes  this castle surely there must be some mistake  it is too much fortune at once he came here for the same purpose he went to you indeed yes  to get more money by extortion  and a promise to poison anybody i liked d n  it is the offer he made to me  and he named you he named you to me  and said i should be soon tired of you you have caged him oh  dear  no  he has a suite of apartments in the eastern tower  where he passes for a philosopher  or a wizard  as people like best how i have given him leave there indeed yes  and what is more amazing is  that he is to aid me in poisoning you when i have become tired of you this is a riddle i cannot unravel  tell me the solution well  dear  listen he came to me and told me of something i already knew  and demanded money and a residence for his convenience  and i have granted him the asylum you have i have i see  i will give him an inch or two of my andrea ferrara no no do you countenance him for a time  listen we want men in the mines  my late husband sent very few to them of late years  and therefore they are getting short of men there aye  aye the thing will be for you to feign ignorance of the man  and then you will be able to get him seized  and placed in the mines  for such men as he are dangerous  and carry poisoned weapons would he not be better out of the world at once  there would be no escape  and no future contingencies no no  i will have no more lives taken  and he will be made useful and  moreover  he will have time to reflect upon the mistake he had made in threatening me he was paid for the job  and he had no future claim  but what about the child oh  he may remain for some time longer here with us it will be dangerous to do so  said the count  he is now ten years old  and there is no knowing what may be done for him by his relatives they dare not enter the gates of this castle morven well  well  but you know he might have travelled the same road as his father  and all would be settled no more lives  as i told you  but we can easily secure him some other way  and we shall be equally as free from him and them that is enough there are dungeons  i know  in this castle  and he can be kept there safe enough he can  but that is not what i propose  we can put him into the mines and confine him as a lunatic excellent you see  we must make those mines more productive somehow or other they would be so  but the count would not hear of it  he said it was so inhuman  they were so destructive of life paha  what were the mines intended for if not for use exactly i often said so  but he always put a negative to it we ll make use of an affirmative  my dear countess  and see what will be the result in a change of policy  by the way  when will our marriage be celebrated not for some months how  so long  i am impatient you must restrain your impatience but we must have the boy settled first  and the count will have been dead a longer time then  and we shall not give so much scandal to the weak minded fools that were his friends  for it will be dangerous to have so many events happen about the same period you shall act as you think proper but the first thing to be done will be  to get this cunning doctor quietly out of the way yes i must contrive to have him seized  and carried to the mines beneath the tower in which he lives is a trap door and a vault  from which  by means of another trap and vault  is a long subterranean passage that leads to a door that opens into one end of the mines  near this end live several men whom you must give some reward to  and they will  by concert  seize him  and set him to work and if he will not work why  they will scourge him in such a manner  that he would be afraid even of a threat of a repetition of the same treatment that will do  but i think the worthy doctor will split himself with rage and malice  he will be like a caged tiger but he will be denuded of his teeth and claws  replied the countess smiling therefore he will have leisure to repent of having threatened his employers                                    some weeks passed over  and the count of morven contrived to become acquainted with the doctor  they appeared to be utter strangers to each other  though each knew the other  the doctor having disguised himself he believed the disguise impenetrable and therefore sat at ease worthy doctor  said the count to him  one day  you have  no doubt  in your studies  become acquainted with many of the secrets of science i have  my lord count  i may say there are few that are not known to father aldrovani  i have spent many years in research indeed yes  the midnight lamp has burned till the glorious sun has reached the horizon  and brings back the day  and yet have i been found beside my books tis well  men like you should well know the value of the purest and most valuable metals the earth produces i know of but one that is gold tis what i mean but tis hard to procure from the bowels of the earth from the heart of these mountains by which we are surrounded yes  that is true  but know you not the owners of this castle and territory possess these mines and work them i believe they do  but i thought they had discontinued working them some years oh  no  that was given out to deceive the government  who claimed so much out of its products oh  ah  aye  i see now and ever since they have been working it privately  and storing bars of gold up in the vaults of this here  in this castle yes  beneath this very tower it being the least frequented the strongest  and perfectly inaccessible from all sides  save the castle it was placed there for the safest deposit i see  and there is much gold deposited in the vaults i believe there is an immense quantity in the vaults and what is your motive for telling me of this hoard of the precious metal why  doctor  i thought that you or i could use a few bars  and that  if we acted in concert  we might be able to take away  at various times and secrete  in some place or other  enough to make us rich men for all our lives i should like to see this gold before i said anything about it replied the doctor  thoughtfully as you please  do you find a lamp that will not go out by the sudden draughts of air  or have the means of relighting it  and i will accompany you when this very night  good doctor  when you shall see such a golden harvest you never yet hoped for  or even believed in to night be it  then  replied the doctor  i will have a lamp that will answer our purpose  and some other matters do  good doctor  and the count left the philosopher s cell                                    the plan takes  said the count to the countess  give me the keys  and the worthy man will be in safety before daylight is he not suspicious not at all                                    that night  about an hour before midnight the count morven stole towards the philosopher s room  he tapped at the door enter  said the philosopher the count entered  and saw the philosopher seated  and by him a lamp of peculiar construction  and incased in gauze wire  and a cloak are you ready  inquired the count quite  he replied is that your lamp it is follow me  then  and hold the lamp tolerably high  as the way is strange  and the steps steep lead on you have made up your mind  i dare say  as to what share of the undertaking you will accept of with me and what if i will not  said the philosopher  coolly it falls to the ground  and i return the keys to their place i dare say i shall not refuse  if you have not deceived me as to the quantity and purity of the metal they have stored up i am no judge of these metals  doctor  i am no assayest  but i believe you will find what i have to show you will far exceed your expectations on that head tis well  proceed they had now got to the first vault  in which stood the first door  and with some difficulty  they opened the vault door it has not been opened for some time  said the philosopher i dare say not  they seldom used to go here  from what i can learn though it is kept a great secret and we can keep it so  likewise true they now entered the vault  and came to the second door  which opened into a kind of flight of steps  cut out of the solid rock  and then along a passage cut out of the mountain  of some kind of stone  but not so hard as the rock itself you see  said the count  what care has been taken to isolate the place  and detach it from the castle  so that it should not be dependent upon the possessor of the castle  this is the last door but one  and now prepare yourself for a surprise  doctor  this will be an extraordinary one so saying  the count opened the door  and stepped on one side  when the doctor approached the place  and was immediately thrust forward by the count and he rolled down some steps into the mine  and was immediately seized by some of the miners  who had been stationed there for that purpose  and carried to a distant part of the mine  there to work for the remainder of his life the count  seeing all secure  refastened the doors  and returned to the castle  a few weeks after this the body of a youth  mangled and disfigured  was brought to the castle  which the countess said was her son s body the count had immediately secured the real heir  and thrust him into the mines  there to pass a life of labour and hopeless misery                                    there was a high feast held  the castle gates were thrown open  and everybody who came were entertained without question this was on the occasion of the count s and countess s marriage  it seemed many months after the death of her son  whom she affected to mourn for a long time however  the marriage took place  and in all magnificence and splendour the countess again appeared arrayed in splendour and beauty  she was proud and haughty  and the count was imperious in the mean time  the young count de hugo de verole was confined in the mines  and the doctor with him by a strange coincidence  the doctor and the young count became companions  and the former  meditating projects of revenge  educated the young count as well as he was able for several years in the mines  and cherished in the young man a spirit of revenge  they finally escaped together  and proceeded to leyden  where the doctor had friends  and where he placed his pupil at the university  and thus made him a most efficient means of revenge  because the education of the count gave him a means of appreciating the splendour and rank he had been deprived of he  therefore  determined to remain at leyden until he was of age  and then apply to his father s friends  and then to his sovereign  to dispossess and punish them both for their double crime the count and countess lived on in a state of regal splendour  the immense revenue of his territory  and the treasure the late count had amassed  as well as the revenue that the mines brought in  would have supported a much larger expenditure than even their tastes disposed them to enjoy they had heard nothing of the escape of the doctor and the young count indeed  those who knew of it held their peace and said nothing about it for they feared the consequences of their negligence  the first intimation they received was at the hands of a state messenger summoning them to deliver up the castle revenues and treasure of the late count this was astounding to them  and they refused to do so  but were soon after seized upon by a regiment of cuirassiers sent to take them  and they were accused of the crime of murder at the instance of the doctor they were arraigned and found guilty  and  as they were of the patrician order  their execution was delayed  and they were committed to exile this was done out of favour to the young count  who did not wish to have his family name tainted by a public execution  or their being confined like convicts the count and countess quitted hungary  and settled in italy  where they lived upon the remains of the count of morven s property  shorn of all their splendour but enough to keep them from being compelled to do any menial office the young count took possession of his patrimony and his treasure at last  such as was left by his mother and her paramour the doctor continued to hide his crime from the young count  and the perpetrators denying all knowledge of it  he escaped  but he returned to his native place  leyden  with a reward for his services from the young count flora rose from her perusal of the manuscript  which here ended  and even as she did so  she heard a footstep approaching her chamber door chapter xx the dreadful mistake the terrific interview in the chamber the attack of the vampyre illustration the footstep which flora  upon the close of the tale she had been reading  heard approaching her apartment  came rapidly along the corridor it is henry  returned to conduct me to an interview with charles s uncle  she said  i wonder  now  what manner of man he is  he should in some respects resemble charles  and if he do so  i shall bestow upon him some affection for that alone tap tap came upon the chamber door  flora was not at all alarmed now as she had been when henry brought her the manuscript  from some strange action of the nervous system  she felt quite confident  and resolved to brave everything  but then she felt quite sure that it was henry  and before the knocking had taken her by surprise come in  she said  in a cheerful voice  come in the door opened with wonderful swiftness a figure stepped into the room  and then closed it as rapidly  and stood against it  flora tried to scream  but her tongue refused its office  a confused whirl of sensations passed through her brain she trembled  and an icy coldness came over her  it was sir francis varney  the vampyre he had drawn up his tall  gaunt frame to its full height  and crossed his arms upon his breast  there was a hideous smile upon his sallow countenance  and his voice was deep and sepulchral  as he said flora bannerworth  hear that which i have to say  and hear it calmly you need have nothing to fear  make an alarm scream  or shout for help and  by the hell beneath us  you are lost there was a death like  cold  passionless manner about the utterance of these words  as if they were spoken mechanically  and came from no human lips flora heard them  and yet scarcely comprehended them  she stepped slowly back till she reached a chair  and there she held for support  the only part of the address of varney that thoroughly reached her ears  was that if she gave any alarm some dreadful consequences were to ensue  but it was not on account of these words that she really gave no alarm  it was because she was utterly unable to do so answer me  said varney  promise that you will hear that which i have to say  in so promising you commit yourself to no evil  and you shall hear that which shall give you much peace it was in vain she tried to speak  her lips moved  but she uttered no sound you are terrified  said varney  and yet i know not why  i do not come to do you harm  although harm have you done me  girl  i come to rescue you from a thraldom of the soul under which you now labour there was a pause of some moments  duration  and then  faintly  flora managed to say help  help  oh  help me  heaven varney made a gesture of impatience  as he said heaven works no special matters now  flora bannerworth  if you have as much intellect as your nobility and beauty would warrant the world in supposing  you will listen to me i i hear  said flora  as she still  dragging the chair with her increased the distance between them tis well  you are now more composed she fixed her eyes upon the face of varney with a shudder  there could be no mistake  it was the same which  with the strange  glassy looking eyes  had glared upon her on that awful night of the storm when she was visited by the vampyre  and varney returned that gaze unflinchingly there was a hideous and strange contortion of his face now as he said you are beautiful  the most cunning statuary might well model some rare work of art from those rounded limbs  that were surely made to bewitch the gazer  your skin rivals the driven snow what a face of loveliness and what a form of enchantment she did not speak  but a thought came across her mind  which at once crimsoned her cheek she knew she had fainted on the first visit of the vampyre  and now he  with a hideous reverence  praised beauties which he might have cast his demoniac eyes over at such a time you understand me  he said  well  let that pass  i am something allied to humanity yet speak your errand  gasped flora  or come what may  i scream for help to those who will not be slow to render it i know it you know i will scream no  you will hear me  i know they would not be slow to tender help to you  but you will not call for it  i will present to you no necessity say on say on you perceive i do not attempt to approach you  my errand is one of peace peace from you  horrible being  if you be really what even now my appalled imagination shrinks from naming you  would not even to you absolute annihilation be a blessing peace  peace  i came not here to talk on such a subject  i must be brief  flora bannerworth  for time presses  i do not hate you  wherefore should i  you are young  and you are beautiful  and you bear a name which should command  and does command  some portion of my best regard there is a portrait  said flora  in this house no more no more  i know what you would say it is yours the house  and all within  i covet  he said  uneasily  let that suffice  i have quarrelled with your brother i have quarrelled with one who just now fancies he loves you charles holland loves me truly it does not suit me now to dispute that point with you  i have the means of knowing more of the secrets of the human heart than common men i tell you  flora bannerworth  that he who talks to you of love  loves you not but with the fleeting fancy of a boy  and there is one who hides deep in his heart a world of passion  one who has never spoken to you of love  and yet who loves you with a love as far surpassing the evanescent fancy of this boy holland  as does the mighty ocean the most placid lake that ever basked in idleness beneath a summer s sun there was a wonderful fascination in the manner now of varney  his voice sounded like music itself  his words flowed from his tongue  each gently and properly accented  with all the charm of eloquence despite her trembling horror of that man despite her fearful opinion which might be said to amount to a conviction of what he really was flora felt an irresistible wish to hear him speak on  ay  despite too the ungrateful theme to her heart which he had now chosen as the subject of his discourse  she felt her fear of him gradually dissipating  and now when he made a pause  she said you are much mistaken  on the constancy and truth of charles holland  i would stake my life no doubt  no doubt have you spoken now that which you had to say no  no  i tell you i covet this place  i would purchase it  but having with your bad tempered brothers quarrelled  they will hold no further converse with me and well they may refuse be  that as it may  sweet lady  i come to you to be my mediator  in the shadow of the future i can see many events which are to come indeed it is so  borrowing some wisdom from the past  and some from resources i would not detail to you  i know that if i have inflicted much misery upon you  i can spare you much more  your brother or your lover will challenge me oh  no  no i say such will happen  and i can kill either  my skill as well as my strength is superhuman mercy  mercy  gasped flora  i will spare either or both on a condition what fearful condition it is not a fearful one  your terrors go far before the fact  all i wish  maiden  of you is to induce these imperious brothers of yours to sell or let the hall to me is that all it is  i ask no more  and  in return  i promise you not only that i will not fight with them  but that you shall never see me again  rest securely  maiden  you will be undisturbed by me oh  god  that were indeed an assurance worth the striving for  said flora it is one you may have  but oh  i knew my heart told me there was yet some fearful condition to come you are wrong again  i only ask of you that you keep this meeting a secret no  no  no i cannot nay  what so easy i will not  i have no secrets from those i love indeed  you will find soon the expediency of a few at least  but if you will not  i cannot urge it longer  do as your wayward woman s nature prompts you there was a slight  but a very slight  tone of aggravation in these words  and the manner in which they were uttered as he spoke  he moved from the door towards the window  which opened into a kitchen garden  flora shrunk as far from him as possible  and for a few moments they regarded each other in silence young blood  said varney  mantles in your veins she shuddered with terror be mindful of the condition i have proposed to you  i covet bannerworth hall i i hear and i must have it  i will have it  although my path to it be through a sea of blood  you understand me  maiden  repeat what has passed between us or not  as you please  i say  beware of me  if you keep not the condition i have proposed heaven knows that this place is becoming daily more hateful to us all said flora indeed you well might know so much  it is no sacrifice to urge it now  i will urge my brother thanks a thousand thanks  you may not live to regret even having made a friend of varney the vampyre  said flora he advanced towards her a step  and she involuntarily uttered a scream of terror in an instant his hand clasped her waist with the power of an iron vice she felt hit hot breath flushing on her cheek  her senses reeled  and she found herself sinking  she gathered all her breath and all her energies into one piercing shriek  and then she fell to the floor  there was a sudden crash of broken glass  and then all was still chapter xxi the conference between the uncle and nephew  and the alarm illustration meanwhile charles holland had taken his uncle by the arm  and led him into a private room dear uncle  he said  be seated  and i will explain everything without reserve seated nonsense  i ll walk about  said the admiral  d n me  i ve no patience to be seated  and very seldom had or have  go on now  you young scamp well well  you abuse me  but i am quite sure  had you been in my situation  you would have acted precisely as i have done no  i shouldn t well  but  uncle don t think to come over me by calling me uncle  hark you charles from this moment i won t be your uncle any more very well  sir it ain t very well  and how dare you  you buccaneer  call me sir  eh  i say  how dare you i will call you anything you like but i won t be called anything i like  you might as well call me at once morgan  the pirate  for he was called anything he liked  hilloa sir  how dare you laugh  eh  i ll teach you to laugh at me  i wish i had you on board ship that s all  you young rascal  i d soon teach you to laugh at your superior officer  i would oh  uncle  i did not laugh at you what did you laugh at  then at the joke joke  d n me  there was no joke at all oh  very good and it ain t very good charles knew very well that  this sort of humour  in which was the old admiral  would soon pass away  and then that he would listen to him comfortably enough  so he would not allow the least exhibition of petulance or mere impatience to escape himself  but contented himself by waiting until the ebullition of feeling fairly worked itself out well  well  at length said the old man  you have dragged me here into a very small and a very dull room  under pretence of having something to tell me  and i have heard nothing yet then i will now tell you  said charles  i fell in love bah with flora bannerworth  abroad  she is not only the most beautiful of created beings bah but her mind is of the highest order of intelligence  honour  candour and all amiable feelings bah really  uncle  if you say bah  to everything  i cannot go on and what the deuce difference  sir  does it make to you  whether i say bah  or not well  i love her  she came to england  and  as i could not exist  but was getting ill  and should  no doubt  have died if i had not done so  i came to england but d e  i want to know about the mermaid the vampyre  you mean  sir well  well  the vampyre then  uncle  all i can tell you is  that it is supposed a vampyre came one night and inflicted a wound upon flora s neck with his teeth  and that he is still endeavouring to renew his horrible existence from the young  pure blood that flows through her veins the devil he is yes  i am bewildered  i must confess  by the mass of circumstances that have combined to give the affair a horrible truthfulness  poor flora is much injured in health and spirits  and when i came home  she  at once implored me to give her up  and think of her no more  for she could not think of allowing me to unite my fate with hers  under such circumstances she did such were her words  uncle  she implored me she used that word implore to fly from her  to leave her to her fate  to endeavour to find happiness with some one else well but i saw her heart was breaking what o  that much of that  uncle  i told her that when i deserted her in the hour of misfortune that i hoped heaven would desert me  i told her that if her happiness was wrecked  to cling yet to me  and that with what power and what strength god had given me  i would stand between her and all ill and what then she she fell upon my breast and wept and blessed me  could i desert her could i say to her  my dear girl  when you were full of health and beauty  i loved you  but now that sadness is at your heart i leave you could i tell her that  uncle  and yet call myself a man no  roared the old admiral  in a voice that made the room echo again and i tell you what  if you had done so  d n you  you puppy  i d have braced you  and and married the girl myself  i would  d e  but i would dear uncle don t dear me  sir  talk of deserting a girl when the signal of distress  in the shape of a tear  is in her eye but i you are a wretch a confounded lubberly boy a swab a d d bad grampus you mistake  uncle no  i don t  god bless you  charles  you shall have her if a whole ship s crew of vampyres said no  you shall have her  let me see her just let me see her the admiral gave his lips a vigorous wipe with his sleeve  and charles said hastily my dear uncle  you will recollect that miss bannerworth is quite a young lady i suppose she is well  then  for god s sake  don t attempt to kiss her not kiss her  d e  they like it  not kiss her  because she s a young lady  d e  do you think i d kiss a corporal of marines no  uncle  but you know young ladies are very delicate and ain t i delicate shiver my timbers  ain t i delicate  where is she  that s what i want to know then you approve of what i have done you are a young scamp  but you have got some of the old admiral s family blood in you  so don t take any credit for acting like an honest man you couldn t help it but if i had not so acted  said charles  with a smile  what would have become of the family blood  then what s that to you  i would have disowned you  because that very thing would have convinced me you were an impostor  and did not belong to the family at all well  that would have been one way of getting over the difficulty no difficulty at all  the man who deserts the good ship that carries him through the waves  or the girl that trusts her heart to him  ought to be chopped up into meat for wild monkeys well  i think so to of course you do why  of course because it s so d d reasonable that  being a nephew of mine  you can t possibly help it bravo  uncle  i had no idea you were so argumentative hadn t you  spooney  you d be an ornament to the gun room  you would but where s the young lady  who is so infernal delicate where is she i say i will fetch her  uncle ah  do  i ll be bound  now  she s one of the right build a good figure head  and don t make too much stern way illustration well  well  whatever you do  now don t pay her any compliments  for your efforts in that line are of such a very doubtful order  that i shall dread to hear you you be off  and mind your own business  i haven t been at sea forty years without picking up some out and out delicate compliments to say to a young lady but do you really imagine  now  that the deck of a man of war is a nice place to pick up courtly compliments in of course i do  there you hear the best of language  d e  you don t know what you are talking about  you fellows that have stuck on shore all your lives  it s we seamen who learn life well  well hark what s that a cry did you not hear a cry a signal of distress  by g d in their efforts to leave the room  the uncle and nephew for about a minute actually blocked up the door way  but the superior bulk of the admiral prevailed  and after nearly squeezing poor charles flat  he got out first but this did not avail him  for he knew not where to go  now  the second scream which flora had uttered when the vampyre had clasped her waist came upon their ears  and  as they were outside the room  it acted well as a guide in which direction to come charles fancied correctly enough at once that it proceeded from the room which was called flora s own room  and thitherward accordingly he dashed at tremendous speed henry  however  happened to be nearer at hand  and  moreover  he did not hesitate a moment  because he knew that flora was in her own room  so he reached it first  and charles saw him rush in a few moments before he could reach the room the difference of time  however  was very slight  and henry had only just raised flora from the floor as charles appeared god of heaven  cried the latter  what has happened i know not  said henry  as god is my judge  i know not  flora  flora speak to us  flora  flora she has fainted  cried charles  some water may restore her  oh henry  henry  is not this horrible courage  courage  said henry although his voice betrayed what a terrible state of anxiety he was himself in  you will find water in that decanter  charles  here is my mother  too  another visit  god help us mrs  bannerworth sat down on the edge of the sofa which was in the room and could only wring her hands and weep avast  cried the admiral  making his appearance  where s the enemy lads uncle  said charles  uncle  uncle  the vampyre has been here again the dreadful vampyre d n me  and he s gone  too  and carried half the window with him  look there it was literally true  the window  which was a long latticed one  was smashed through help  oh  help  said flora  as the water that was dashed in her face began to recover her you are safe  cried henry  you are safe flora  said charles  you know my voice  dear flora  look up  and you will see there are none here but those who love you flora opened her eyes timidly as the said has it gone yes  yes  dear  said charles  look around you  here are none but true friends and tried friends  my dear  said admiral bell  excepting me  and whenever you like to try me  afloat or ashore  d n me  shew me old nick himself  and i won t shrink yard arm and yard arm grapnel to grapnel pitch pots and grenades this is my uncle  flora  said charles i thank you  sir  said flora  faintly all right  whispered the admiral to charles  what a figure head  to be sure  poll at swansea would have made just about four of her  but she wasn t so delicate  d n me i should think not you are right for once in a way  charley what was it that alarmed you  said charles  tenderly  as he now took one of flora s hands in his varney varney  the vampyre varney  exclaimed henry  varney here yes  he came in at that door  and when i screamed  i suppose for i hardly was conscious he darted out through the window this  said henry  is beyond all human patience  by heaven  i cannot and will not endure it it shall be my quarrel  said charles  i shall go at once and defy him  he shall meet me oh  no  no  no  said flora  as she clung convulsively to charles  no no  there is a better way what way the place has become full of terrors  let us leave it  let him  as he wishes  have it let him  have it yes  yes  god knows  if it purchase an immunity from these visits  we may well be overjoyed  remember that we have ample reason to believe him more than human  why should you allow yourselves to risk a personal encounter with such a man  who might be glad to kill you that he might have an opportunity of replenishing his own hideous existence from your best heart s blood the young men looked aghast besides  added flora  you cannot tell what dreadful powers of mischief he may have  against which human courage might be of no avail there is truth and reason  said mr  marchdale  stepping forward  in what flora says only let me come across him  that s all  said admiral bell  and i ll soon find out what he is  i suppose he s some long slab of a lubber after all  ain t he  with no strength his strength is immense  said marchdale  i tried to seize him  and i fell beneath his arm as if i had been struck by the hammer of a cyclops a what  cried the admiral a cyclops d n me  i served aboard the cyclops eleven years  and never saw a very big hammer aboard of her what on earth is to be done  said henry oh  chimed in the admiral  there s always a bother about what s to be done on earth  now  at sea  i could soon tell you what was to be done we must hold a solemn consultation over this matter  said henry  you are safe now  flora oh  be ruled by me  give up the hall you tremble i do tremble  brother  for what may yet ensue  i implore you to give up the hall  it is but a terror to us now give it up  have no more to do with it  let us make terms with sir francis varney  remember  we dare not kill him he ought to be smothered  said the admiral it is true  remarked henry  we dare not  even holding all the terrible suspicions we do  take his life by foul means certainly not  said charles  were he ten times a vampyre  i cannot  however  believe that he is so invulnerable as he is represented no one represents him here  said marchdale  i speak  sir  because i saw you glance at me  i only know that  having made two unsuccessful attempts to seize him  he eluded me  once by leaving in my grasp a piece of his coat  and the next time he struck me down  and i feel yet the effects of the terrific blow you hear  said flora yes  i hear  said charles for some reason  added marchdale  in a tone of emotion  what i say seems to fall always badly upon mr  holland s ear  i know not why  but if it will give him any satisfaction  i will leave bannerworth hall to night no  no  no  said henry  for the love of heaven  do not let us quarrel hear  hear  cried the admiral  we can never fight the enemy well if the ship s crew are on bad terms  come now  you charles  this appears to be an honest  gentlemanly fellow give him your hand if mr  charles holland  said marchdale  knows aught to my prejudice in any way  however slight  i here beg of him to declare it at once  and openly i cannot assert that i do  said charles then what the deuce do you make yourself so disagreeable for  eh cried the admiral one cannot help one s impression and feelings  said charles  but i am willing to take mr  marchdale s hand and i yours  young sir  said marchdale  in all sincerity of spirit and with good will towards you they shook hands  but it required no conjuror to perceive that it was not done willingly or cordially  it was a handshaking of that character which seemed to imply on each side  i don t like you  but i don t know positively any harm of you there now  said the admiral  that s better now  let us hold counsel about this varney  said henry  come to the parlour all of you  and we will endeavour to come to some decided arrangement do not weep  mother  said flora  all may yet be well  we will leave this place we will consider that question  flora  said henry  and believe me your wishes will go a long way with all of us  as you may well suppose they always would they left mrs  bannerworth with flora  and proceeded to the small oaken parlour  in which were the elaborate and beautiful carvings which have been before mentioned henry s countenance  perhaps  wore the most determined expression of all  he appeared now as if he had thoroughly made up his mind to do something which should have a decided tendency to put a stop to the terrible scenes which were now day by day taking place beneath that roof charles holland looked serious and thoughtful  as if he were revolving some course of action in his mind concerning which he was not quite clear mr  marchdale was more sad and depressed  to all appearance  than any of them as for the admiral  he was evidently in a state of amazement  and knew not what to think  he was anxious to do something  and yet what that was to be he had not the most remote idea  any more than as if he was not at all cognisant of any of those circumstances  every one of which was so completely out of the line of his former life and experience george had gone to call on mr  chillingworth  so he was not present at the first part of this serious council of war chapter xxii the consultation the determination to leave the hall illustration this was certainly the most seriously reasonable meeting which had been held at bannerworth hall on the subject of the much dreaded vampyre  the absolute necessity for doing something of a decisive character was abundantly apparent  and when henry promised flora that her earnest wish to leave the house should not be forgotten as an element in the discussion which was about to ensue  it was with a rapidly growing feeling on his own part  to the effect that that house  associated even as it was with many endearing recollections  was no home for him hence he was the more inclined to propose a departure from the hall if it could possibly be arranged satisfactorily in a pecuniary point of view  the pecuniary point of view  however  in which henry was compelled to look at the subject  was an important and a troublesome one we have already hinted at the very peculiar state of the finances of the family  and  in fact  although the income derivable from various sources ought to have been amply sufficient to provide henry  and those who were dependent upon him  with a respectable livelihood  yet it was nearly all swallowed up by the payment of regular instalments upon family debts incurred by his father  and the creditors took great credit to themselves that they allowed of such an arrangement  instead of sweeping off all before them  and leaving the family to starve the question  therefore  or  at all events  one of the questions  now was  how far would a departure from the hall of him  henry  and the other branches of the family  act upon that arrangement during a very few minutes  consideration  henry  with the frank and candid disposition which was so strong a characteristic of his character  made up his mind to explain all this fully to charles holland and his uncle when once he formed such a determination he was not likely to be slow in carrying it into effect  and no sooner  then  were the whole of them seated in the small oaken parlour than he made an explicit statement of his circumstances but  said mr  marchdale  when he had done  i cannot see what right your creditors have to complain of where you live  so long as you perform your contract to them true  but they always expected me  i knew  to remain at the hall  and if they chose  why  of course  at any time  they could sell off the whole property for what it would fetch  and pay themselves as far as the proceeds would go  at all events  i am quite certain there could be nothing at all left for me i cannot imagine  added mr  marchdale  that any men could be so unreasonable it is scarcely to be borne  remarked charles holland  with more impatience than he usually displayed  that a whole family are to be put to the necessity of leaving their home for no other reason than the being pestered by such a neighbour as sir francis varney  it makes one impatient and angry to reflect upon such a state of things and yet they are lamentably true  said henry  what can we do surely there must be some sort of remedy there is but one that i can imagine  and that is one we all alike revolt from  we might kill him that is out of the question of course my impression is that he bears the same name really as myself  and that he is my ancestor  from whom was painted the portrait on the panel have circumstances really so far pressed upon you  said charles holland  as at length to convince you that this man is really the horrible creature we surmise he may be dare we longer doubt it  cried henry  in a tone of excitement  he is the vampyre i ll be hanged if i believe it  said admiral bell  stuff and nonsense  vampyre  indeed  bother the vampyre sir  said henry  you have not had brought before you  painfully  as we have  all the circumstances upon which we  in a manner  feel compelled to found this horrible belief  at first incredulity was a natural thing  we had no idea that ever we could be brought to believe in such a thing that is the case  added marchdale  but  step by step  we have been driven from utter disbelief in this phenomenon to a trembling conviction that it must be true unless we admit that  simultaneously  the senses of a number of persons have been deceived that is scarcely possible then do you mean really to say there are such fish  said the admiral we think so well  i m d d  i have heard all sorts of yarns about what fellows have seen in one ocean and another  but this does beat them all to nothing it is monstrous  exclaimed charles there was a pause of some few moments  duration  and then mr  marchdale said  in a low voice perhaps i ought not to propose any course of action until you  henry have yourself done so  but even at the risk of being presumptuous  i will say that i am firmly of opinion you ought to leave the hall i am inclined to think so  too  said henry but the creditors  interposed charles i think they might be consulted on the matter beforehand  added marchdale  when no doubt they would acquiesce in an arrangement which could do them no harm certainly  no harm  said henry  for i cannot take the estate with me as they well know precisely  if you do not like to sell it  you can let it to whom why  under the existing circumstances  it is not likely you would get any tenant for it than the one who has offered himself sir francis varney yes  it seems to be a great object with him to live here  and it appears to me  that notwithstanding all that has occurred  it is most decidedly the best policy to let him nobody could really deny the reasonableness of this advice  although it seemed strange  and was repugnant to the feelings of them all  as they heard it  there was a pause of some seconds  duration  and then henry said it does  indeed  seem singular  to surrender one s house to such a being especially  said charles  after what has occurred true well  said mr  marchdale  if any better plan of proceeding  taking the whole case into consideration  can be devised  i shall be most happy will you consent to put off all proceedings for three days  said charles holland  suddenly have you any plan  my dear sir  said mr  marchdale i have  but it is one which i would rather say nothing about for the present i have no objection  said henry  i do not know that three days can make any difference in the state of affairs  let it be so  if you wish charles then i am satisfied  said charles  i cannot but feel that  situated as i am regarding flora  this is almost more my affair than even yours henry i cannot see that  said henry  why should you take upon yourself more of the responsibility of these affairs than i  charles  you induce in my mind a suspicion that you have some desperate project in your imagination  which by such a proposition you would seek to reconcile me to charles was silent  and henry then added now  charles  i am quite convinced that what i have hinted at is the fact  you have conceived some scheme which you fancy would be much opposed by us i will not deny that i have  said charles  it is one  however  which you must allow me for the present to keep locked in my own breast why will you not trust us for two reasons indeed the one is  that i have not yet thoroughly determined upon the course i project  and the other is  that it is one in which i am not justified in involving any one else charles  charles  said henry  despondingly  only consider for a moment into what new misery you may plunge poor flora  who is  heaven knows  already sufficiently afflicted  by attempting an enterprise which even we  who are your friends  may unwittingly cross you in the performance of this is one in which i fear no such result  it cannot so happen  do not urge me can t you say at once what you think of doing  said the old admiral what do you mean by turning your sails in all sorts of directions so oddly  you sneak  why don t you be what do you call it explicit i cannot  uncle what  are you tongue tied all here know well  said charles  that if i do not unfold my mind fully  it is not that i fear to trust any one present  but from some other most special reason charles  i forbear to urge you further  said henry  and only implore you to be careful at this moment the room door opened  and george bannerworth  accompanied by mr  chillingworth  came in do not let me intrude  said the surgeon  i fear  as i see you seated gentlemen  that my presence must be a rudeness and a disturbance to some family consultation among yourselves not at all  mr  chillingworth  said henry  pray be seated  we are very glad indeed to see you  admiral bell  this is a friend on whom we can rely mr  chillingworth and one of the right sort  i can see  said the admiral  as he shook mr  chillingworth by the hand sir  you do me much honour  said the doctor none at all  none at all  i suppose you know all about this infernal odd vampyre business i believe i do  sir and what do you think of it i think time will develop the circumstances sufficiently to convince us all that such things cannot be d n me  you are the most sensible fellow  then  that i have yet met with since i have been in this neighbourhood  for everybody else is so convinced about the vampyre  that they are ready to swear by him it would take much more to convince me  i was coming over here when i met mr  george bannerworth coming to my house yes  said george  and mr  chillingworth has something to tell us of a nature confirmatory of our own suspicions it is strange  said henry  but any piece of news  come it from what quarter it may  seems to be confirmatory  in some degree or another  of that dreadful belief in vampyres why  said the doctor  when mr  george says that my news is of such a character  i think he goes a little too far  what i have to tell you  i do not conceive has anything whatever to do with the fact  or one fact of there being vampyres let us hear it  said henry it is simply this  that i was sent for by sir francis varney myself you sent for yes  he sent for me by a special messenger to come to him  and when i went  which  under the circumstances  you may well guess  i did with all the celerity possible  i found it was to consult me about a flesh wound in his arm  which was showing some angry symptoms indeed yes  it was so  when i was introduced to him i found him lying on a couch  and looking pale and unwell  in the most respectful manner  he asked me to be seated  and when i had taken a chair  he added mr  chillingworth  i have sent for you in consequence of a slight accident which has happened to my arm  i was incautiously loading some fire arms  and discharged a pistol so close to me that the bullet inflicted a wound on my arm if you will allow me  said i  to see the wound  i will give you my opinion he then showed me a jagged wound  which had evidently been caused by the passage of a bullet  which  had it gone a little deeper  must have inflicted serious injury  as it was  the wound was but trifling he had evidently been attempting to dress it himself  but finding some considerable inflammation  he very likely got a little alarmed you dressed the wound i did and what do you think of sir francis varney  now that you have had so capital an opportunity  said henry  of a close examination of him why  there is certainly something odd about him which i cannot well define  but  take him altogether  he can be a very gentlemanly man indeed so he can his manners are easy and polished  he has evidently mixed in good society  and i never  in all my life  heard such a sweet  soft  winning voice that is strictly him  you noticed  i presume  his great likeness to the portrait on the panel i did  at some moments  and viewing his face in some particular lights it showed much more strongly than at others  my impression was that he could  when he liked  look much more like the portrait on the panel than when he allowed his face to assume its ordinary appearance probably such an impression would be produced upon your mind  said charles  by some accidental expression of the countenance which even he was not aware of  and which often occurs in families it may be so of course you did not hint  sir  at what has passed here with regard to him  said henry i did not  being  you see  called in professionally  i had no right to take advantage of that circumstance to make any remarks to him about his private affairs certainly not it was all one to me whether he was a vampyre or not  professionally and however deeply i might feel  personally  interested in the matter  i said nothing to him about it  because  you see  if i had  he would have had a fair opportunity of saying at once  pray  sir  what is that to you  and i should have been at a loss what to reply can we doubt  said henry  but that this very wound has been inflicted upon sir francis varney  by the pistol bullet which was discharged at him by flora everything leads to such an assumption certainly  said charles holland and yet you cannot even deduce from that the absolute fact of sir francis varney being a vampyre i do not think  mr  chillingworth  said marchdale  anything would convince you but a visit from him  and an actual attempt to fasten upon some of your own veins that would not convince me  said chillingworth then you will not be convinced i certainly will not  i mean to hold out to the last  i said at the first  and i say so still  that i never will give way to this most outrageous superstition i wish i could think with you  said marchdale  with a shudder  but there may be something in the very atmosphere of this house which has been rendered hideous by the awful visits that have been made to it which forbids me to disbelieve in those things which others more happily situated can hold at arm s length  and utterly repudiate there may be  said henry  but as to that  i think  after the very strongly expressed wish of flora  i will decide upon leaving the house will you sell it or let it the latter i should much prefer  was the reply but who will take it now  except sir francis varney  why not at once let him have it  i am well aware that this does sound odd advice  but remember  we are all the creatures of circumstances  and that  in some cases where we least like it  we must swim with the stream that you will not decide upon  however  at present  said charles holland  as he rose certainly not  a few days can make no difference none for the worse  certainly  and possibly much for the better be it so  we will wait uncle  said charles  will you spare me half an hour of your company an hour  my boy  if you want it  said the admiral  rising from his chair then this consultation is over  said henry  and we quite understand that to leave the hall is a matter determined on  and that in a few days a decision shall be come to as to whether varney the vampyre shall be its tenant or not chapter xxiii the admiral s advice to charles holland the challenge to the vampyre illustration when charles holland got his uncle into a room by themselves  he said uncle  you are a seaman  and accustomed to decide upon matters of honour  i look upon myself as having been most grievously insulted by this sir francis varney  all accounts agree in representing him as a gentleman  he goes openly by a title  which  if it were not his  could easily be contradicted  therefore  on the score of position in life there is no fault to find with him  what would you do if you were insulted by a gentleman the old admiral s eyes sparkled  and he looked comically in the face of charles  as he said i know now where you are steering what would you do  uncle fight him i knew you would say so  and that s just what i want to do as regards sir francis varney well  my boy  i don t know that you can do better  he must be a thundering rascal  whether he is a vampyre or not  so if you feel that he has insulted you  fight him by all means  charles i am much pleased  uncle  to find that you take my view of the subject  said charles  i knew that if i mentioned such a thing to the bannerworths  they would endeavour all in their power to pursuade me against it yes  no doubt  because they are all impressed with a strange fear of this fellow s vampyre powers  besides  if a man is going to fight  the fewer people he mentions it to most decidedly the better  charles i believe that is the fact  uncle  should i overcome varney  there will most likely be at once an end to the numerous and uncomfortable perplexities of the bannerworths as regards him  and if he overcome me why  then  at all events  i shall have made an effort to rescue flora from the dread of this man and then he shall fight me  added the admiral  so he shall have two chances  at all events  charles nay  uncle  that would  you know  scarcely be fair  besides  if i should fall  i solemnly bequeath flora bannerworth to your good offices i much fear that the pecuniary affairs of poor henry from no fault of his  heaven knows are in a very bad state  and that flora may yet live to want some kind and able friend never fear  charles  the young creature shall never want while the old admiral has got a shot in the locker thank you  uncle  thank you  i have ample cause to know  and to be able to rely upon your kind and generous nature  and now about the challenge you write it  boy  and i ll take it will you second me  uncle to be sure i will  i wouldn t trust anybody else to do so on any account  you leave all the arrangements with me  and i ll second you as you ought to be seconded then i will write it at once  for i have received injuries at the hands of that man  or devil  be he what he may  that i cannot put up with  his visit to the chamber of her whom i love would alone constitute ample ground of action i should say it rather would  my boy and after this corroborative story of the wound  i cannot for a moment doubt that sir francis varney is the vampyre  or the personifier of the vampyre that s clear enough  charles  come  just you write your challenge  my boy  at once  and let me have it i will  uncle charles was a little astonished  although pleased  at his uncle s ready acquiescence in his fighting a vampyre  but that circumstance he ascribed to the old man s habits of life  which made him so familiar with strife and personal contentions of all sorts  that he did not ascribe to it that amount of importance which more peaceable people did had he  while he was writing the note to sir francis varney  seen the old admiral s face  and the exceedingly cunning look it wore  he might have suspected that the acquiescence in the duel was but a seeming acquiescence  this  however  escaped him  and in a few moments he read to his uncle the following note      to sir francis varney      sir the expressions made use of towards me by you  as well as      general circumstances  which i need not further allude to here      induce me to demand of you that satisfaction due from one      gentleman to another  my uncle  admiral bell  is the bearer of      this note  and will arrange preliminaries with any friend you may      choose to appoint to act in your behalf  i am  sir  yours  c      charles holland will that do  said charles capital  said the admiral i am glad you like it oh  i could not help liking it  the least said and the most to the purpose  always pleases me best  and this explains nothing  and demands all you want which is a fight  so it s all right  you see  and nothing can be possibly better charles did glance in his uncle s face  for he suspected  from the manner in which these words were uttered  that the old man was amusing himself a little at his expense  the admiral  however  looked so supernaturally serious that charles was foiled i repeat  it s a capital letter  he said yes  you said so well  what are you staring at oh  nothing do you doubt my word not at all  uncle  only i thought there was a degree of irony in the manner in which you spoke none at all  my boy  i never was more serious in all my life very good  then you will remember that i leave my honour in this affair completely in your hands depend upon me  my boy i will  and do i ll be off and see the fellow at once the admiral bustled out of the room  and in a few moments charles heard him calling loudly jack jack pringle  you lubber  where are you jack pringle  i say ay  ay  sir  said jack  emerging from the kitchen  where he had been making himself generally useful in assisting mrs  bannerworth  there being no servant in the house  to cook some dinner for the family come on  you rascal  we are going for a walk the rations will be served out soon  growled jack we shall be back in time  you cormorant  never fear  you are always thinking of eating and drinking  you are  jack  and i ll be hanged if i think you ever think of anything else  come on  will you  i m going on rather a particular cruise just now  so mind what you are about aye  aye  sir  said the tar  and these two originals  who so perfectly understood each other  walked away  conversing as they went  and their different voices coming upon the ear of charles  until distance obliterated all impression of the sound charles paced to and fro in the room where he had held this brief and conclusive conversation with his uncle  he was thoughtful  as any one might well be who knew not but that the next four and twenty hours would be the limit of his sojourn in this world oh  flora flora  he at length said  how happy we might to have been together how happy we might have been  but all is past now  and there seems nothing left us but to endure  there it but one chance  and that is in my killing this fearful man who is invested with so dreadful an existence  and if i do kill him in fair and in open fight  i will take care that his mortal frame has no power again to revisit the glimpses of the moon it was strange to imagine that such was the force of many concurrent circumstances  that a young man like charles holland  of first rate abilities and education  should find it necessary to give in so far to a belief which was repugnant to all his best feelings and habits of thought  as to be reasoning with himself upon the best means of preventing the resuscitation of the corpse of a vampyre  but so it was his imagination had yielded to a succession of events which very few persons indeed could have held out against i have heard and read  he said  as he continued his agitated and uneasy walk  of how these dreadful beings are to be in their graves  i have heard of stakes being driven through the body so as to pin it to the earth until the gradual progress of decay has rendered its revivification a thing of utter and total impossibility  then  again he added  after a slight pause  i have heard of their being burned  and the ashes gathered to the winds of heaven to prevent them from ever again uniting or assuming human form illustration these were disagreeable and strange fancies  and he shuddered while he indulged in them  he felt a kind of trembling horror come over him even at the thought of engaging in conflict with a being  who perhaps  had lived more than a hundred years that portrait  he thought  on the panel  is the portrait of a man in the prime of life  if it be the portrait of sir francis varney  by the date which the family ascribe to it he must be nearly one hundred and fifty years of age now this was a supposition which carried the imagination to a vast amount of strange conjectures what changes he must have witnessed about him in that time  thought charles  how he must have seen kingdoms totter and fall  and how many changes of habits  of manners  and of customs must he have become a spectator of  renewing too  ever and anon  his fearful existence by such fearful means this was a wide field of conjecture for a fertile imagination  and now that he was on the eve of engaging with such a being in mortal combat on behalf of her he loved  the thoughts it gave rise to came more strongly and thickly upon him than ever they had done before but i will fight him  he suddenly said  for flora s sake  were he a hundred times more hideous a being than so many evidences tend to prove him  i will fight with him  and it may be my fate to rid the world of such a monster in human form charles worked himself up to a kind of enthusiasm by which he almost succeeded in convincing himself that  in attempting the destruction of sir francis varney  he was the champion of human nature it would be aside from the object of these pages  which is to record facts as they occurred  to enter into the metaphysical course of reasoning which came across charles s mind  suffice it to say that he felt nothing shaken as regarded his resolve to meet varney the vampyre and that he made up his mind the conflict should be one of life or death it must be so  he said  it must be so  either he or i must fall in the fight which shall surely be he now sought flora  for how soon might he now be torn from her for ever by the irresistible hand of death  he felt that  during the few brief hours which now would only elapse previous to his meeting with sir francis varney  he could not enjoy too much of the society of her who reigned supreme in his heart  and held in her own keeping his best affections but while charles is thus employed  let us follow his uncle and jack pringle to the residence of varney  which  as the reader is aware  was so near at hand that it required not many minutes  sharp walking to reach it the admiral knew well he could trust jack with any secret  for long habits of discipline and deference to the orders of superiors takes off the propensity to blabbing which  among civilians who are not accustomed to discipline  is so very prevalent  the old man therefore explained to jack what he meant to do  and it received jack s full approval  but as in the enforced detail of other matters it must come out  we will not here prematurely enter into the admiral s plans when they reached the residence of sir francis varney  they were received courteously enough  and the admiral desired jack to wait for him in the handsome hall of the house  while he was shewn up stairs to the private room of the vampyre confound the fellow  muttered the old admiral  he is well lodged at all events  i should say he was not one of those sort of vampyres who have nowhere to go to but their own coffins when the evening comes the room into which the admiral was shewn had green blinds to it  and they were all drawn down  it is true that the sun was shining brightly outside  although transiently  but still a strange green tinge was thrown over everything in the room  and more particularly did it appear to fall upon the face of varney  converting his usually sallow countenance into a still more hideous and strange colour  he was sitting upon a couch  and  when the admiral came in  he rose  and said  in a deep toned voice  extremely different to that he usually spoke in my humble home is much honoured  sir  by your presence in it good morning  said the admiral  i have come to speak to you  sir rather seriously however abrupt this announcement may sound to me  said varney  i am quite sure i shall always hear  with the most profound respect  whatever admiral bell may have to say there is no respect required  said the admiral  but only a little attention sir francis bowed in a stately manner  saying i shall be quite unhappy if you will not be seated  admiral bell oh  never mind that  sir francis varney  if you be sir francis varney for you may be the devil himself  for all i know  my nephew  charles holland  considers that  one way and another  he has a very tolerable quarrel with you i much grieve to hear it do you believe me  i do  i am most scrupulous in what i say  and an assertion that i am grieved  you may thoroughly and entirely depend upon well  well  never mind that  charles holland is a young man just entering into life  he loves a girl who is  i think  every way worthy of him oh  what a felicitous prospect just hear me out  if you please with pleasure  sir with pleasure well  then  when a young  hot headed fellow thinks he has a good ground of quarrel with anybody  you will not be surprised at his wanting to fight it out not at all well  then  to come to the point  my nephew  charles holland  has a fancy for fighting with you ah you take it d d easy my dear sir  why should i be uneasy  he is not my nephew  you know  i shall have no particular cause  beyond those feelings of common compassion which i hope inhabit my breast as well as every one else s what do you mean why  he is a young man just  as you say  entering into life  and i cannot help thinking it would be a pity to cut him off like a flower in the bud  so very soon oh  you make quite sure  then  of settling him  do you my dear sir  only consider  he might be very troublesome  indeed  you know young men are hot headed and troublesome  even if i were only to maim him  he might be a continual and never ceasing annoyance to me  i think i should be absolutely  in a manner of speaking  compelled to cut him off the devil you do as you say  sir d n your assurance  mr  vampyre  or whatever odd fish you may be admiral bell  i never called upon you and received a courteous reception  and then insulted you then why do you talk of cutting off a better man than yourself  d n it  what would you say to him cutting you off oh  as for me  my good sir  that s quite another thing  cutting me off is very doubtful sir francis varney gave a strange smile as he spoke  and shook his head as if some most extraordinary and extravagant proposition had been mooted  which it was scarcely worth the while of anybody possessed of common sense to set about expecting admiral bell felt strongly inclined to get into a rage  but he repressed the idea as much as he could  although  but for the curious faint green light that came through the blinds  his heightened colour would have sufficiently proclaimed what state of mind he was in mr  varney  he said  all this is quite beside the question  but  at all events  if it have any weight at all  it ought to have a considerable influence in deciding you to accept of what terms i propose what are they  sir why  that you permit me to espouse my nephew charles s quarrel  and meet you instead of him you meet me yes  i ve met a better man more than once before  it can make no difference to you i don t know that  admiral bell  one generally likes  in a duel  to face him with whom one has had the misunderstanding  be it on what grounds it may there s some reason  i know  in what you say  but  surely  if i am willing  you need not object and is your nephew willing thus to shift the danger and the job of resenting his own quarrels on to your shoulders no  he knows nothing about it  he has written you a challenge  of which i am the bearer  but i voluntarily  and of my own accord  wish to meet you instead this is a strange mode of proceeding if you will not accede to it  and fight him first  and any harm comes to him  you shall fight me afterwards indeed yes  indeed you shall  however surprised you may look as this appears to be quite a family affair  then  said sir francis varney  it certainly does appear immaterial which of you i fight with first quite so  now you take a sensible view of the question  will you meet me i have no particular objection  have you settled all your affairs  and made your will what s that to you oh  i only asked  because there is generally so much food for litigation if a man dies intestate  and is worth any money you make devilish sure  said the admiral  of being the victor  have you made your will oh  my will  smiled sir francis  that  my good sir  is quite an indifferent affair well  make it or not  as you like  i am old  i know  but i can pull a trigger as well as any one do what pull a trigger why  you don t suppose i resort to any such barbarous modes of fighting barbarous  why  how do you fight then as a gentleman  with my sword swords  oh  nonsense  nobody fights with swords now a days  that s all exploded i cling to the customs and the fashions of my youth  said varney  i have been  years ago  accustomed always to wear a sword  and to be without one now vexes me pray  how many years ago i am older than i look  but that is not the question  i am willing to meet you with swords if you like  you are no doubt aware that  as the challenged party  i am entitled to the choice of weapons i am then you cannot object to my availing myself of the one in the use of which i am perfectly unequalled indeed yes  i am  i think  the first swordsman in europe  i have had immense practice well  sir  you have certainly made a most unexpected choice of weapons i can use a sword still  but am by no means a master of fencing however  it shall not be said that i went back from my word  and let the chances be as desperate as they may  i will meet you very good with swords ay  with swords  but i must have everything properly arranged  so that no blame can rest on me  you know  as you will be killed  you are safe from all consequences  but i shall be in a very different position  so if you please  i must have this meeting got up in such a manner as shall enable me to prove  to whoever may question me on the subject  that you had fair play oh  never fear that but i do fear it  the world  my good sir  is censorious  and you cannot stop people from saying extremely ill natured things what do you require  then i require you to send me a friend with a formal challenge well then i shall refer him to a friend of mine  and they two must settle everything between them is that all not quite  i will have a surgeon on the ground  in case  when i pink you  there should be a chance of saving your life  it always looks humane when you pink me precisely upon my word  you take these affairs easy  i suppose you have had a few of them oh  a good number  people like yourself worry me into them  i don t like the trouble  i assure you  it is no amusement to me  i would rather  by a great deal  make some concession than fight  because i will fight with swords  and the result is then so certain that there is no danger in the matter to me hark you  sir francis varney  you are either a very clever actor  or a man  as you say  of such skill with your sword  that you can make sure of the result of a duel  you know  therefore  that it is not fair play on your part to fight a duel with that weapon oh  i beg your pardon there  i never challenge anybody  and when foolish people will call me out  contrary to my inclination  i think i am bound to take what care of myself i can d n me  there s some reason in that  too  said the admiral  but why do you insult people people insult me first oh  nonsense how should you like to be called a vampyre  and stared at as if you were some hideous natural phenomenon well  but i say  admiral bell  how should you like it  i am a harmless country gentleman  and because  in the heated imaginations of some member of a crack brained family  some housebreaker has been converted into a vampyre  i am to be pitched upon as the man  and insulted and persecuted accordingly but you forget the proofs what proofs the portrait  for one what  because there is an accidental likeness between me and an old picture  am i to be set down as a vampyre  why  when i was in austria last  i saw an old portrait of a celebrated court fool  and you so strongly resemble it  that i was quite struck when i first saw you with the likeness  but i was not so unpolite as to tell you that i considered you were the court fool turned vampyre d n your assurance and d n yours  if you come to that the admiral was fairly beaten  sir francis varney was by far too long headed and witty for him  after now in vain endeavouring to find something to say  the old man buttoned up his coat in a great passion and looking fiercely at varney  he said i don t pretend to a gift of the gab  d n me  it ain t one of my peculiarities  but though you may talk me down  you sha n t keep me down very good  sir it is not very good  you shall hear from me i am willing i don t care whether you are willing or not  you shall find that when once i begin to tackle an enemy  i don t so easily leave him  one or both of us  sir  is sure to sink agreed so say i  you shall find that i m a tar for all weathers  and if you were a hundred and fifty vampires all rolled into one  i d tackle you somehow the admiral walked to the door in high dudgeon  when he was near to it varney said  in some of his most winning and gentle accents will you not take some refreshment  sir before you go from my humble house no  roared the admiral something cooling no very good  sir  a hospitable host can do no more than offer to entertain his guests admiral bell turned at the door  and said  with some degree of intense bitterness you look rather poorly  i suppose  to night  you will go and suck somebody s blood  you shark you confounded vampyre  you ought to be made to swallow a red hot brick  and then let dance about till it digests varney smiled as he rang the bell  and said to a servant show my very excellent friend admiral bell out  he will not take any refreshments the servant bowed  and preceded the admiral down the staircase  but  to his great surprise  instead of a compliment in the shape of a shilling or half a crown for his pains  he received a tremendous kick behind with a request to go and take it to his master  with his compliments the fume that the old admiral was in beggars all description  he walked to bannerworth hall at such a rapid pace  that jack pringle had the greatest difficulty in the world to keep up with him  so as to be at all within speaking distance hilloa  jack  cried the old man  when they were close to the hall did you see me kick that fellow ay  ay  sir well  that s some consolation  at any rate  if somebody saw it  it ought to have been his master  that s all i can say to it  and i wish it had how have you settled it  sir settled what the fight  sir d n me  jack  i haven t settled it at all that s bad  sir i know it is  but it shall be settled for all that  i can tell him  let him vapour as much as he may about pinking me  and one thing and another pinking you  sir yes  he wants to fight with cutlasses  or toasting forks  d n me  i don t know exactly which  and then he must have a surgeon on the ground for fear when he pinks me i shouldn t slip my cable in a regular way and he should be blamed jack gave a long whistle  as he replied going to do it  sir i don t know now what i m going to do  mind  jack  mum is the word ay  ay  sir i ll turn the matter over in my mind  and then decide upon what had best be done  if he pinks me  i ll take d d good care he don t pink charles no  sir  don t let him do that  a wamphigher  sir  ain t no good opponent to anybody  i never seed one afore  but it strikes me as the best way to settle him  would be to shut him up in some little bit of a cabin  and then smoke him with brimstone  sir well  well  i ll consider  jack  i ll consider  something must be done and that quickly too  zounds  here s charles what the deuce shall i say to him  by way of an excuse  i wonder  for not arranging his affair with varney  hang me  if i ain t taken aback now  and don t know where to place a hand chapter xxiv the letter to charles the quarrel the admiral s narrative the midnight meeting illustration it was charles holland who now advanced hurriedly to meet the admiral the young man s manner was anxious  he was evidently most intent upon knowing what answer could be sent by sir francis varney to his challenge uncle  he said  tell me at once  will he meet me  you can talk of particulars afterwards  but now tell me at once if he will meet me why  as to that  said the admiral  with a great deal of fidgetty hesitation  you see  i can t exactly say not say no  he s a very odd fish  don t you think he s a very odd fish  jack pringle ay  ay  sir there  you hear  charles  that jack is of my opinion that your opponent is an odd fish but  uncle  why trifle with my impatience thus  have you seen sir francis varney seen him  oh  yes and what did he say why  to tell the truth  my lad  i advise you not to fight with him at all uncle  is this like you  this advice from you  to compromise my honour after sending a man a challenge d n it all  jack  i don t know how to get out of it  said the admiral  i tell you what it is  charles  he wants to fight with swords and what on earth is the use of your engaging with a fellow who has been practising at his weapon for more than a hundred years well  uncle  if any one had told me that you would be terrified by this sir francis varney into advising me not to fight  i should have had no hesitation whatever in saying such a thing was impossible i terrified why  you advise me not to meet this man  even after i have challenged him jack  said the admiral  i can t carry it on  you see  i never could go on with anything that was not as plain as an anchor  and quite straightforward  i must just tell all that has occurred ay  ay  sir  the best way you think so  jack i know it is  sir  always axing pardon for having a opinion at all excepting when it happens to be the same as yourn  sir hold your tongue  you libellous villain  now  listen to me  charles  i got up a scheme of my own charles gave a groan  for he had a very tolerable appreciation of his uncle s amount of skill in getting up a scheme of any kind or description now here am i  continued the admiral  an old hulk  and not fit for use anymore  what s the use of me  i should like to know  well  that s settled  but you are young and hearty  and have a long life before you why should you throw away your life upon a lubberly vampyre i begin to perceive now  uncle  said charles  reproachfully  why you with such apparent readiness  agreed to this duel taking place well  i intended to fight the fellow myself  that s the long and short of it  boy how could you treat me so no nonsense  charles  i tell you it was all in the family  i intended to fight him myself  what was the odds whether i slipped my cable with his assistance  or in the regular course a little after this  that s the way to argufy the subject  so  as i tell you  i made up my mind to fight him myself charles looked despairingly  but said what was the result oh  the result  d n me  i suppose that s to come  the vagabond won t fight like a christian  he says he s quite willing to fight anybody that calls him out  provided it s all regular well well and he  being the party challenged for he says he never himself challenges anybody  as he is quite tired of it must have his choice of weapons he is entitled to that  but it is generally understood now a days that pistols are the weapons in use among gentlemen for such purposes ah  but he won t understand any such thing  i tell you  he will fight with swords i suppose he is  then  an adept at the use of the sword he says he is no doubt no doubt  i cannot blame a man for choosing  when he has the liberty of choice  that weapon in the use of which he most particularly from practice  excels yes  but if he be one half the swordsman he has had time enough according to all accounts  to be  what sort of chance have you with him do i hear you reasoning thus yes  to be sure you do  i have turned wonderfully prudent  you see  so i mean to fight him myself  and mind  now  you have nothing whatever to do with it an effort of prudence that  certainly well  didn t i say so come come  uncle  this won t do  i have challenged sir francis varney and i must meet him with any weapon he may  as the challenged party choose to select  besides  you are not  i dare say  aware that i am a very good fencer  and probably stand as fair a chance as varney in a contest with swords indeed yes  uncle  i could not be so long on the continent as i have been without picking up a good knowledge of the sword  which is so popular all over germany humph  but only consider  this d d fellow is no less than a hundred and fifty years old i care not yes  but i do uncle  uncle  i tell you i will fight with him  and if you do not arrange matters for me so that i can have the meeting with this man which i have myself sought  and cannot  even if i wished  now recede from with honour  i must seek some other less scrupulous friend to do so give me an hour or two to think of it  charles  said the admiral don t speak to any one else  but give me a little time  you shall have no cause of complaint  your honour cannot suffer in my hands i will wait your leisure  uncle  but remember that such affairs as these  when once broached  had always better be concluded with all convenient dispatch i know that  boy i know that the admiral walked away  and charles  who really felt much fretted at the delay which had taken place  returned to the house he had not been there long  when a lad  who had been temporarily hired during the morning by henry to answer the gate  brought him a note saying a servant  sir  left this for you just now for me  said charles  as he glanced at the direction  this is strange  for i have no acquaintance about here  does any one wait no  sir the note was properly directed to him  therefore charles holland at once opened it  a glance at the bottom of the page told him that it came from his enemy  sir francis varney  and then he read it with much eagerness it ran thus      sir your uncle  as he stated himself to be  admiral bell  was      the bearer to me  as i understood him this day  of a challenge      from you  owing to some unaccountable hallucination of intellect      he seemed to imagine that i intended to set myself up as a sort      of animated target  for any one to shoot at who might have a      fancy so to do      according to this eccentric view of the case  the admiral had      the kindness to offer to fight me first  when  should he not have      the good fortune to put me out of the world  you were to try your      skill  doubtless      i need scarcely say that i object to these family arrangements      you have challenged me  and  fancying the offence sufficient  you      defy me to mortal combat  if  therefore  i fight with any one at      all  it must be with you      you will clearly understand me  sir  that i do not accuse you of      being at all party to this freak of intellect of your uncle s      he  no doubt  alone conceived it  with a laudable desire on his      part of serving you  if  however  to meet me  do so to night  in      the middle of the park surrounding your own friends estate      there is a pollard oak growing close to a small pool  you  no      doubt  have noticed the spot often  meet me there  if you please      and any satisfaction you like i will give you  at twelve o clock      this night      come alone  or you will not see me  it shall be at your own      option entirely  to convert the meeting into a hostile one or      not  you need send me no answer to this  if you are at the place      i mention at the time i have named  well and good  if you an not      i can only  if i please  imagine that you shrink from a meeting      with      francis varney charles holland read this letter twice over carefully  and then folding it up  and placing it in his pocket  he said yes  i will meet him  he may be assured that i will meet him  he shall find that i do not shrink from francis varney in the name of honour love  virtue  and heaven  i will meet this man  and it shall go hard with me but i will this night wring from him the secret of what he really is  for the sake of her who is so dear to me for her sake  i will meet this man  or monster  be he what he may it would have been far more prudent had charles informed henry bannerworth or george of his determination to meet the vampyre that evening  but he did not do so  somehow he fancied it would be some reproach against his courage if he did not go  and go alone  too  for he could not help suspecting that  from the conduct of his uncle  sir francis varney might have got up an opinion inimical to his courage with all the eager excitement of youth  there was nothing that arrayed itself to his mind in such melancholy and uncomfortable colours as an imputation upon his courage i will show this vampyre  if he be such  he said  that i am not afraid to meet him  and alone  too  at his own hour at midnight  even when  if his preternatural powers be of more avail to him than at any other time  he can attempt  if he dare  to use them charles resolved upon going armed  and with the greatest care he loaded his pistols  and placed them aside ready for action  when the time should come to set out to meet the vampyre at the spot in the park which had been particularly alluded to in his letter this spot was perfectly well known to charles  indeed  no one could be a single day at bannerworth hall without noticing it  so prominent an object was that pollard oak  standing  as it did  alone  with the beautiful green sward all around it  near to it was the pool which hid been mentioned  which was  in reality  a fish pond  and some little distance off commenced the thick plantation  among the intricacies of which sir francis varney  or the vampyre  had been supposed to disappear  after the revivification of his body at the full of the moon this spot was in view of several of the windows of the house  so that if the night should happen to be a very light one  and any of the inhabitants of the hall should happen to have the curiosity to look from those particular windows  no doubt the meeting between charles holland and the vampyre would be seen this  however  was a contingency which was nothing to charles  whatever it might be to sir francis varney  and he scarcely at all considered it as worth consideration  he felt more happy and comfortable now that everything seemed to be definitively arranged by which he could come to some sort of explanation with that mysterious being who had so effectually  as yet  succeeded in destroying his peace of mind and his prospects of happiness i will this night force him to declare himself  thought charles  he shall tell me who and what he really is  and by some means i will endeavour to put an end to those frightful persecutions which flora has suffered this was a thought which considerably raised charles s spirits  and when he sought flora again  which he now did  she was surprised to see him so much more easy and composed in his mind  which was sufficiently shown by his manner  than he had been but so short a time before charles  she said  what has happened to give such an impetus to your spirits nothing  dear flora  nothing  but i have been endeavouring to throw from my mind all gloomy thoughts  and to convince myself that in the future you and i  dearest  may yet be very happy oh  charles  if i could but think so endeavour  flora  to think so  remember how much our happiness is always in our own power  flora  and that  let fate do her worst  so long as we are true to each other  we have a recompense for every ill oh  indeed  charles  that is a dear recompense and it is well that no force of circumstances short of death itself can divide us true  charles  true  and i am more than ever now bound to look upon you with a loving heart  for have you not clung to me generously under circumstances which  if any at all could have justified you in rending asunder every tie which bound us together  surely would have done so most fully it is misfortune and distress that tries love  said charles  it is thus that the touchstone is applied to see if it be current gold indeed or some base metal  which by a superficial glitter imitates it and your love is indeed true gold i am unworthy of one glance from those dear eyes if it were not oh  if we could but go from here i think then we might be happy  a strong impression is upon my mind  and has been so for some time  that these persecutions to which i have been subjected are peculiar to this house think you so i do  indeed it may be so  flora  you are aware that your brother has made up his mind that he will leave the hall yes  yes and that only in deference to an expressed wish of mine he put off the carrying such a resolve into effect for a few days he said so much do not  however  imagine  dearest flora  that those few days will be idly spent nay  charles  i could not imagine so believe me  i have some hopes that in that short space of time i shall be able to accomplish yet something which shall have a material effect upon the present posture of affairs do not run into danger  charles i will not  believe me  flora  i have too much appreciation of the value of an existence which is blessed by your love  to encounter any needless risks you say needless  why do you not confide in me  and tell me if the object you have in view to accomplish in the few days delay is a dangerous one at all will you forgive me  flora  if for once i keep a secret from you then  charles  along with the forgiveness i must conjure up a host of apprehensions nay  why so you would tell me if there were no circumstances that you feared would fill me with alarm now  flora  your fears and not your judgment condemn me  surely you cannot think me so utterly heedless as to court danger for danger s sake no  not so you pause and yet you have a sense of what you call honour  which  i fear  would lead you into much risk i have a sense of honour  but not that foolish one which hangs far more upon the opinions of others than my own  if i thought a course of honour lay before me  and all the world  in a mistaken judgment  were to condemn it as wrong  i would follow it you are right  charles  you are right  let me pray of you to be careful  and  at all events  to interpose no more delay to our leaving this house than you shall feel convinced is absolutely necessary for some object of real and permanent importance charles promised flora bannerworth that for her sake  as well as his own  he would be most specially careful of his safety  and then in such endearing conversation as may be well supposed to be dictated by such hearts as theirs another happy hour was passed away illustration they pictured to themselves the scene where first they met  and with a world of interest hanging on every word they uttered  they told each other of the first delightful dawnings of that affection which had sprung up between them  and which they fondly believed neither time nor circumstance would have the power to change or subvert in the meantime the old admiral was surprised that charles was so patient  and had not been to him to demand the result of his deliberation but he knew not on what rapid pinions time flies  when in the presence of those whom we love  what was an actual hour  was but a fleeting minute to charles holland  as he sat with flora s hand clasped in his and looking at her sweet face at length a clock striking reminded him of his engagement with his uncle  and he reluctantly rose dear flora  he said  i am going to sit up to watch to night  so be under no sort of apprehension i will feel doubly safe  she said i have now something to talk to my uncle about  and must leave you flora smiled  and held out her hand to him  he pressed it to his heart he knew not what impulse came over him then  but for the first time he kissed the cheek of the beautiful girl with a heightened colour she gently repulsed him  he took a long lingering look at her as he passed out of the room  and when the door was closed between them  the sensation he experienced was as if some sudden cloud had swept across the face of the sun  dimming to a vast extent its precious lustre a strange heaviness came across his spirits  which before had been so unaccountably raised  he felt as if the shadow of some coming evil was resting on his soul as if some momentous calamity was preparing for him  which would almost be enough to drive him to madness  and irredeemable despair what can this be  he exclaimed  that thus oppresses me  what feeling is this that seems to tell me  i shall never again see flora bannerworth unconsciously he uttered these words  which betrayed the nature of his worst forebodings oh  this is weakness  he then added  i must fight out against this it is mere nervousness  i must not endure it  i will not suffer myself thus to become the sport of imagination  courage  courage  charles holland  there are real evils enough  without your adding to them by those of a disordered fancy  courage  courage  courage chapter xxv the admiral s opinion the request of charles illustration charles then sought the admiral  whom he found with his hands behind him  pacing to and fro in one of the long walks of the garden  evidently in a very unsettled state of mind  when charles appeared  he quickened his pace  and looked in such a state of unusual perplexity that it was quite ridiculous to observe him i suppose  uncle  you have made up your mind thoroughly by this time well  i don t know that why  you have had long enough surely to think over it  i have not troubled you soon well  i cannot exactly say you have  but  somehow or another  i don t think very fast  and i have an unfortunate propensity after a time of coming exactly round to where i began then  to tell the truth  uncle  you can come to no sort of conclusion only one and what may that be why  that you are right in one thing  charles  which is  that having sent a challenge to this fellow of a vampyre  you must fight him i suspect that that is a conclusion you had from the first  uncle why so because it is an obvious and a natural one  all your doubts  and trouble  and perplexities  have been to try and find some excuse for not entertaining that opinion  and now that you really find it in vain to make it  i trust that you will accede as you first promised to do  and not seek by any means to thwart me i will not thwart you  my boy  although in my opinion you ought not to fight with a vampyre never mind that  we cannot urge that as a valid excuse  so long as he chooses to deny being one  and after all  if he be really wrongfully suspected  you must admit that he is a very injured man injured nonsense  if he is not a vampyre  he s some other out of the way sort of fish  you may depend  he s the oddest looking fellow ever i came across in all my born days  ashore or afloat is he yes  he is  and yet  when i come to look at the thing again in my mind some droll sights that i have seen come across my memory  the sea is the place for wonders and for mysteries  why  we see more in a day and a night there  than you landsmen could contrive to make a whole twelvemonth s wonder of but you never saw a vampyre  uncle well  i don t know that  i didn t know anything about vampyres till i came here  but that was my ignorance  you know  there might have been lots of vampyres where i ve been  for all i know oh  certainly  but as regards this duel  will you wait now until to morrow morning  before you take any further steps in the matter till to morrow morning yes  uncle why  only a little while ago  you were all eagerness to have something done off hand just so  but now i have a particular reason for waiting until to morrow morning have you  well  as you please  boy as you please  have everything your own way you are very kind  uncle  and now i have another favour to ask of you what is it why  you know that henry bannerworth receives but a very small sum out of the whole proceeds of the estate here  which ought  but for his father s extravagance  to be wholly at his disposal so i have heard i am certain he is at present distressed for money  and i have not much  will you lend me fifty pounds  uncle  until my own affairs are sufficiently arranged to enable you to pay yourself again will i  of course i will i wish to offer that sum as an accommodation to henry  from me  i dare say he will receive it freely  because he must be convinced how freely it is offered  and  besides  they look upon me now almost as a member of the family in consequence of my engagement with flora certainly  and quite correct too  there s a fifty pound note  my boy take it  and do what you like with it  and when you want any more  come to me for it i knew i could trespass thus far on your kindness  uncle trespass  it s no trespass at all well  we will not fall out about the terms in which i cannot help expressing my gratitude to you for many favours  to morrow  you will arrange the duel for me as you please  i don t altogether like going to that fellow s house again well  then  we can manage  i dare say  by note very good  do so  he puts me in mind altogether of a circumstance that happened a good while ago  when i was at sea  and not so old a man as i am now puts you in mind of a circumstance  uncle yes  he s something like a fellow that figured in an affair that i know a good deal about  only i do think as my chap was more mysterious by a d d sight than this one indeed oh  dear  yes  when anything happens in an odd way at sea  it is as odd again as anything that occurs on land  my boy  you may depend oh  you only fancy that  uncle  because you have spent so long a time at sea no  i don t imagine it  you rascal  what can you have on shore equal to what we have at sea  why  the sights that come before us would make you landsmen s hairs stand up on end  and never come down again in the ocean  do you mean  that you see those sights  uncle to be sure  i was once in the southern ocean  in a small frigate looking out for a seventy four we were to join company with  when a man at the mast head sung out that he saw her on the larboard bow  well  we thought it was all right enough  and made away that quarter  when what do you think it turned out to be i really cannot say the head of a fish a fish yes  a d d deal bigger than the hull of a vessel  he was swimming along with his head just what i dare say he considered a shaving or so out of the water but where were the sails  uncle the sails yes  your man at the mast head must have been a poor seaman not to have missed the sails all  that s one of your shore going ideas  now  you know nothing whatever about it  i ll tell you where the sails were  master charley well  i should like to know the spray  then  that he dashed up with a pair of fins that were close to his head  was in such a quantity  and so white  that they looked just like sails oh ah  you may say oh  but we all saw him the whole ship s crew  and we sailed alongside of him for some time  till he got tired of us  and suddenly dived down  making such a vortex in the water  that the ship shook again  and seemed for about a minute as if she was inclined to follow him to the bottom of the sea and what do you suppose it was  uncle how should i know did you ever see it again never  though others have caught a glimpse of him now and then in the same ocean  but never came so near him as we did  that ever i heard of at all events  they may have done so it is singular singular or not  it s a fool to what i can tell you  why  i ve seen things that  if i were to set about describing them to you  you would say i was making up a romance oh  no  it s quite impossible  uncle  any one could ever suspect you of such a thing you d believe me  would you of course i would then here goes  i ll just tell you now of a circumstance that i haven t liked to mention to anybody yet indeed  why so because i didn t want to be continually fighting people for not believing it  but here you have it we were outward bound  a good ship  a good captain  and good messmates you know  go far towards making a prosperous voyage a pleasant and happy one  and on this occasion we had every reasonable prospect of all our hands were all tried men they had been sailors from infancy  none of your french craft  that serve an apprenticeship and then become land lubbers again  oh  no  they were stanch and true  and loved the ocean as the sluggard loves his bed  or the lover his mistress ay  and for the matter of that  the love was a more enduring and a more healthy love  for it increased with years  and made men love one another  and they would stand by each other while they had a limb to lift while they were able to chew a quid or wink an eye  leave alone wag a pigtail we were outward bound for ceylon  with cargo  and were to bring spices and other matters home from the indian market  the ship was new and good a pretty craft  she sat like a duck upon the water  and a stiff breeze carried her along the surface of the waves without your rocking and pitching  and tossing  like an old wash tub at a mill tail  as i have had the misfortune to sail in more than once afore no  no  we were well laden  and well pleased  and weighed anchor with light hearts and a hearty cheer away we went down the river  and soon rounded the north foreland  and stood out in the channel  the breeze was a steady and stiff one  and carried us through the water as though it had been made for us jack  said i to a messmate of mine  as he stood looking at the skies then at the sails  and finally at the water  with a graver air than i thought was at all consistent with the occasion or circumstances well  he replied what ails you  you seem as melancholy as if we were about to cast lots who should be eaten first  are you well enough i am hearty enough  thank heaven  he said  but i don t like this breeze don t like the breeze  said i  why  mate  it is as good and kind a breeze as ever filled a sail  what would you have  a gale no  no  i fear that with such a ship  and such a set of hearty able seamen  i think we could manage to weather out the stiffest gale that ever whistled through a yard that may be  i hope it is  and i really believe and think so then what makes you so infernally mopish and melancholy i don t know  but can t help it  it seems to me as though there was something hanging over us  and i can t tell what yes  there are the colours  jack  at the masthead  they are flying over us with a hearty breeze ah  ah  said jack  looking up at the colours  and then went away without saying anything more  for he had some piece of duty to perform i thought my messmate had something on his mind that caused him to feel sad and uncomfortable  and i took no more notice of it  indeed  in the course of a day or two he was as merry as any of the rest  and had no more melancholy that i could perceive  but was as comfortable as anybody we had a gale off the coast of biscay  and rode it out without the loss of a spar or a yard  indeed  without the slightest accident or rent of any kind now  jack  what do you think of our vessel  said i she s like a duck upon water  rises and falls with the waves  and doesn t tumble up and down like a hoop over stones no  no  she goes smoothly and sweetly  she is a gallant craft  and this is her first voyage  and i predict a prosperous one i hope so  he said well  we went on prosperously enough for about three weeks  the ocean was as calm and as smooth as a meadow  the breeze light but good  and we stemmed along majestically over the deep blue waters  and passed coast after coast  though all around was nothing but the apparently pathless main in sight a better sailer i never stepped into  said the captain one day  it would be a pleasure to live and die in such a vessel well  as i said  we had been three weeks or thereabouts  when one morning  after the sun was up and the decks washed  we saw a strange man sitting on one of the water casks that were on deck  for  being full  we were compelled to stow some of them on deck you may guess those on deck did a little more than stare at this strange and unexpected apparition  by jingo  i never saw men open their eyes wider in all my life  nor was i any exception to the rule  i stared  as well i might  but we said nothing for some minutes  and the stranger looked calmly on us  and then cocked his eye with a nautical air up at the sky  as if he expected to receive a twopenny post letter from st michael  or a billet doux  from the virgin mary where has he come from  said one of the men in a low tone to his companion  who was standing by him at that moment how can i tell  replied his companion  he may have dropped from the clouds  he seems to be examining the road  perhaps he is going back the stranger sat all this time with the most extreme and provoking coolness and unconcern  he deigned us but a passing notice  but it was very slight he was a tall  spare man what is termed long and lathy but he was evidently a powerful man  he had a broad chest  and long  sinewy arms  a hooked nose  and a black  eagle eye  his hair was curly  but frosted by age  it seemed as though it had been tinged with white at the extremities  but he was hale and active otherwise  to judge from appearances notwithstanding all this  there was a singular repulsiveness about him that i could not imagine the cause  or describe  at the same time there was an air of determination in his wild and singular looking eyes  and over their whole there was decidedly an air and an appearance so sinister as to be positively disagreeable well  said i  after we had stood some minutes  where did you come from  shipmate he looked at me and then up at the sky  in a knowing manner come  come  that won t do  you have none of peter wilkins s wings  and couldn t come on the aerial dodge  it won t do  how did you get here he gave me an awful wink  and made a sort of involuntary movement  which jumped him up a few inches  and he bumped down again on the water cask that s as much as to say  thought i  that he s sat himself on it i ll go and inform the captain  said i  of this affair  he ll hardly believe me when i tell him  i am sure so saying  i left the deck and went to the cabin  where the captain was at breakfast  and related to him what i had seen respecting the stranger  the captain looked at me with an air of disbelief  and said what do you mean to say there s a man on board we haven t seen before yes  i do  captain  i never saw him afore  and he s sitting beating his heels on the water cask on deck the devil he is  i assure you  sir  and he won t answer any questions i ll see to that  i ll see if i can t make the lubber say something providing his tongue s not cut out  but how came he on board  confound it  he can t be the devil  and dropped from the moon don t know  captain  said i  he is evil looking enough  to my mind to be the father of evil  but it s ill bespeaking attentions from that quarter at any time go on  lad  i ll come up after you i left the cabin  and i heard the captain coming after me  when i got on deck  i saw he had not moved from the place where i left him  there was a general commotion among the crew when they heard of the occurrence and all crowded round him  save the man at the wheel  who had to remain at his post the captain now came forward  and the men fell a little back as he approached  for a moment the captain stood silent  attentively examining the stranger  who was excessively cool  and stood the scrutiny with the same unconcern that he would had the captain been looking at his watch well  my man  said the captain  how did you come here i m part of the cargo  he said  with an indescribable leer part of the cargo be d d  said the captain  in sudden rage  for he thought the stranger was coming his jokes too strong  i know you are not in the bills of lading i m contraband  replied the stranger  and my uncle s the great chain of tartary the captain stared  as well he might  and did not speak for some minutes  all the while the stranger kept kicking his heels against the water casks and squinting up at the skies  it made us feel very queer well  i must confess you are not in the regular way of trading oh  no  said the stranger  i am contraband entirely contraband and how did you come on board at this question the stranger again looked curiously up at the skies and continued to do so for more than a minute  he then turned his gaze upon the captain no  no  said the captain  eloquent dumb show won t do with me  you didn t come  like mother shipton  upon a birch broom  how did you come on board my vessel i walked on board  said the stranger you walked on board  and where did you conceal yourself below very good  and why didn t you stay below altogether because i wanted fresh air  i m in a delicate state of health  you see it doesn t do to stay in a confined place too long confound the binnacle  said the captain  it was his usual oath when anything bothered him  and he could not make it out  confound the binnacle what a delicate looking animal you are  i wish you had stayed where you were  your delicacy would have been all the same to me delicate  indeed yes  very  said the stranger  coolly there was something so comic in the assertion of his delicateness of health  that we should all have laughed  but we were somewhat scared and had not the inclination how have you lived since you came on board  inquired the captain very indifferently but how  what have you eaten  and what have you drank nothing  i assure you  all i did while was below was what why  i sucked my thumbs like a polar bear in its winter quarters and as he spoke the stranger put his two thumbs into his mouth  and extraordinary thumbs they were  too  for each would have filled an ordinary man s mouth these  said the stranger  pulling them out  and gazing at them wistfully  and with a deep sigh he continued these were thumbs at one time  but they are nothing now to what they were confound the binnacle  muttered the captain to himself  and then he added  aloud it s cheap living  however  but where are you going to  and why did you come aboard i wanted a cheap cruise  and i am going there and back why  that s where we are going  said the captain then we are brothers  exclaimed the stranger  hopping off the water cask like a kangaroo  and bounding towards the captain  holding out his hand as though he would have shaken hands with him no  no  said the captain  i can t do it can t do it  exclaimed the stranger  angrily  what do you mean that i can t have anything to do with contraband articles  i am a fair trader  and do all above board  i haven t a chaplain on board  or he should offer up prayers for your preservation  and the recovery of your health  which seems so delicate that be the stranger didn t finish the sentence  he merely screwed his mouth up into an incomprehensible shape  and puffed out a lot of breath  with some force  and which sounded very much like a whistle  but  oh  what thick breath he had  it was as much like smoke as anything i ever saw and so my shipmate said i say  captain  said the stranger  as he saw him pacing the deck well just send me up some beef and biscuit  and some coffee royal be sure it s royal  do you hear  because i m partial to brandy  it s the only good thing there is on earth i shall not easily forget the captain s look as he turned towards the stranger  and gave his huge shoulders a shrug  as much as to say well  i can t help it now  he s here  and i can t throw him overboard the coffee  beef  and biscuit were sent him  and the stranger seemed to eat them with great gout  and drank the coffee with much relish  and returned the things  saying your captain is an excellent cook  give him my compliments i thought the captain would think that was but a left handed compliment and look more angry than pleased  but no notice was taken of it it was strange  but this man had impressed upon all in the vessel some singular notion of his being more than he should be more than a mere mortal  and not one endeavoured to interfere with him  the captain was a stout and dare devil a fellow as you would well met with  yet he seemed tacitly to acknowledge more than he would say  for he never after took any further notice of the stranger nor he of him they had barely any conversation  simply a civil word when they first met  and so forth  but there was little or no conversation of any kind between them the stranger slept upon deck  and lived upon deck entirely  he never once went below after we saw him  and his own account of being below so long this was very well  but the night watch did not enjoy his society  and would have willingly dispensed with it at that hour so particularly lonely and dejected upon the broad ocean  and perhaps a thousand miles away from the nearest point of land at this dread and lonely hour  when no sound reaches the ear and disturbs the wrapt stillness of the night  save the whistling of the wind through the cordage  or an occasional dash of water against the vessel s side  the thoughts of the sailor are fixed on far distant objects his own native land and the friends and loved ones he has left behind him he then thinks of the wilderness before  behind  and around him  of the immense body of water  almost in places bottomless  gazing upon such a scene  and with thoughts as strange and indefinite as the very boundless expanse before him  it is no wonder if he should become superstitious  the time and place would  indeed unbidden  conjure up thoughts and feelings of a fearful character and intensity the stranger at such times would occupy his favourite seat on the water cask  and looking up at the sky and then on the ocean  and between whiles he would whistle a strange  wild  unknown melody the flesh of the sailors used to creep up in knots and bumps when they heard it  the wind used to whistle as an accompaniment and pronounce fearful sounds to their ears the wind had been highly favourable from the first  and since the stranger had been discovered it had blown fresh  and we went along at a rapid rate  stemming the water  and dashing the spray off from the bows and cutting the water like a shark this was very singular to us  we couldn t understand it  neither could the captain  and we looked very suspiciously at the stranger  and wished him at the bottom  for the freshness of the wind now became a gale  and yet the ship came through the water steadily  and away we went before the wind  as if the devil drove us  and mind i don t mean to say he didn t the gale increased to a hurricane  and though we had not a stitch of canvass out  yet we drove before the gale as if we had been shot out of the mouth of a gun the stranger still sat on the water casks  and all night long he kept up his infernal whistle  now  sailors don t like to hear any one whistle when there s such a gale blowing over their heads it s like asking for more  but he would persist  and the louder and stronger the wind blew the louder he whistled at length there came a storm of rain  lightning  and wind  we were tossed mountains high  and the foam rose over the vessel  and often entirely over our heads  and the men were lashed to their posts to prevent being washed away but the stranger still lay on the water casks  kicking his heels and whistling his infernal tune  always the same  he wasn t washed away nor moved by the action of the water  indeed  we heartily hoped and expected to see both him and the water cask floated overboard at every minute but  as the captain said confound the binnacle  the old water tub seems as if it were screwed on to the deck  and won t move off and he on the top of it there was a strong inclination to throw him overboard  and the men conversed in low whispers  and came round the captain  saying we have come  captain  to ask you what you think of this strange man who has come so mysteriously on board i can t tell what to think  lads  he s past thinking about he s something above my comprehension altogether  i promise you well  then  we are thinking much of the same thing  captain what do you mean that he ain t exactly one of our sort no  he s no sailor  certainly  and yet  for a land lubber  he s about as rum a customer as ever i met with so he is  sir he stands salt water well  and i must say that i couldn t lay a top of those water casks in that style very well nor nobody amongst us  sir well  then  he s in nobody s way  it he nobody wants to take his berth  i suppose the men looked at each other somewhat blank  they didn t understand the meaning at all far from it  and the idea of any one s wanting to take the stranger s place on the water casks was so outrageously ludicrous that at any other time they would have considered it a devilish good joke and have never ceased laughing at it he paused some minutes  and then one of them said it isn t that we envy him his berth  captain  cause nobody else could live there for a moment  any one amongst us that had been there would have been washed overboard a thousand times over so they would  said the captain well  sir  he s more than us very likely  but how can i help that we think he s the main cause of all this racket in the heavens the storm and hurricane  and that  in short  if he remains much longer we shall all sink i am sorry for it  i don t think we are in any danger  and had the strange being any power to prevent it  he would assuredly do so  lest he got drowned but we think if he were thrown overboard all would be well indeed yes  captain  you may depend upon it he s the cause of all the mischief  throw him overboard and that s all we want i shall not throw him overboard  even if i could do such a thing  and i am by no means sure of anything of the kind we do not ask it  sir what do you desire leave to throw him overboard it is to save our own lives i can t let you do any such thing  he s in nobody s way but he s always a whistling  only hark now  and in such a hurricane as this  it is dreadful to think of it  what else can we do  sir he s not human at this moment  the stranger s whistling came clear upon their ears there was the same wild  unearthly notes as before  but the cadences were stronger  and there was a supernatural clearness in all the tones there now  said another  he s kicking the water cask with his heels confound the binnacle  said the captain  it sounds like short peals of thunder  go and talk to him  lads and if that won t do  sir  may we don t ask me any questions  i don t think a score of the best men that were ever born could move him i don t mind trying  said one upon this the whole of the men moved to the spot where the water casks were standing and the stranger lay there was he  whistling like fury  and  at the same time  beating his heels to the tune against the empty casks  we came up to him  and he took no notice of us at all  but kept on in the same way hilloa  shouted one hilloa  shouted another no notice  however  was taken of us  and one of our number  a big herculean fellow  an irishman  seized him by the leg  either to make him get up  or  as we thought  to give him a lift over our heads into the sea however  he had scarcely got his fingers round the calf of the leg  when the stranger pinched his leg so tight against the water cask  that he could not move  and was as effectually pinned as if he had been nailed there  the stranger  after he had finished a bar of the music  rose gradually to a sitting posture  and without the aid of his hands  and looking the unlucky fellow in the face  he said well  what do you want my hand  said the fellow take it then  he said he did take it  and we saw that there was blood on it the stranger stretched out his left hand  and taking him by the breech he lifted him  without any effort  upon the water cask beside him we all stared at this  and couldn t help it  and we were quite convinced we could not throw him overboard  but he would probably have no difficulty in throwing us overboard well  what do you want  he again exclaimed to us all we looked at one another  and had scarce courage to speak  at length i said we wish you to leave off whistling leave off whistling  he said  and why should i do anything of the kind because it brings the wind ha  ha  why  that s the very reason i am whistling  to bring the wind but we don t want so much pho  pho  you don t know what s good for you it s a beautiful breeze and not a bit too stiff it s a hurricane nonsense but it is now you see how i ll prove you are wrong in a minute  you see my hair don t you  he said  after he took off his cap  very well  look now he got up on the water cask  and stood bolt upright  and running his fingers through his hair  made it all stand straight on end confound the binnacle  said the captain  if ever i saw the like there  said the stranger  triumphantly  don t tell me there s any wind to signify  don t you see  it doesn t even move one of my grey hairs  and if it blew as hard as you say  i am certain it would move a hair confound the binnacle  muttered the captain as he walked away  d n the cabouse  if he ain t older than i am he s too many for me and everybody else are you satisfied what could we say we turned away and left the place  and stood at our quarters there was no help for it we were impelled to grin and abide by it illustration as soon as we had left the place he put his cap on again and sat down on the water casks  and then took leave of his prisoner  whom he set free and there lay at full length on his back  with his legs hanging down once more he began to whistle most furiously  and beat time with his feet for full three weeks did he continue at this game night and day  without any interruption  save such as he required to consume enough coffee royal  junk  and biscuit  as would have served three hearty men well  about that time  one night the whistling ceased and he began to sing oh  it was singing such a voice  gog and magog in guildhall london  when they spoke were nothing to him it was awful  but the wind calmed down to a fresh and stiff breeze  he continued at this game for three whole days and nights  and on the fourth it ceased  and when we went to take his coffee royal to him he was gone we hunted about everywhere  but he was entirely gone  and in three weeks after we safely cast anchor  having performed our voyage in a good month under the usual time  and had it been an old vessel she would have leaked and stinted like a tub from the straining  however  we were glad enough to get in  and were curiously inquisitive as to what was put in our vessel to come back with  for as the captain said confound the binnacle  i ll have no more contraband articles if i can help it chapter xxvi the meeting by moonlight in the park the turret window in the hall the letters illustration the old admiral showed such a strong disposition to take offence at charles if he should presume  for a moment  to doubt the truth of the narrative that was thus communicated to him  that the latter would not anger him by so doing  but confined his observations upon it to saying that he considered it was very wonderful  and very extraordinary  and so on  which very well satisfied the old man the day was now  however  getting far advanced  and charles holland began to think of his engagement with the vampyre  he read and read the letter over and over again  but he could not come to a correct conclusion as to whether it intended to imply that he  sir francis varney  would wish to fight him at the hour and place mentioned  or merely give him a meeting as a preliminary step he was rather  on the whole  inclined to think that some explanation would be offered by varney  but at all events he persevered in his determination of going well armed  lest anything in the shape of treachery should be intended as nothing of any importance occurred now in the interval of time till nearly midnight  we will at once step to that time  and our readers will suppose it to be a quarter to twelve o clock at night  and young charles holland on the point of leaving the house  to keep his appointment by the pollard oak  with the mysterious sir francis varney he placed his loaded pistols conveniently in his pocket  so that at a moment s notice he could lay hands on them  and then wrapping himself up in a travelling cloak he had brought with him to bannerworth hall  he prepared to leave his chamber the moon still shone  although now somewhat on the wane  and although there were certainly many clouds in the sky they were but of a light fleecy character  and very little interrupted the rays of light that came from the nearly full disc of the moon from his window he could not perceive the spot in the park where he was to meet varney  because the room in which he was occupied not a sufficiently high place in the house to enable him to look over a belt of trees that stopped the view  from almost any of the upper windows the pollard oak could be seen it so happened now that the admiral had been placed in a room immediately above the one occupied by his nephew  and  as his mind was full of how he should manage with regard to arranging the preliminaries of the duel between charles and varney on the morrow  he found it difficult to sleep  and after remaining in bed about twenty minutes  and finding that each moment he was only getting more and more restless  he adopted a course which he always did under such circumstances he rose and dressed himself again  intending to sit up for an hour and then turn into bed and try a second time to get to sleep  but he had no means of getting a light  so he drew the heavy curtain from before the window  and let in as much of the moonlight as he could this window commanded a most beautiful and extensive view  for from it the eye could carry completely over the tops of the tallest trees  so that there was no interruption whatever to the prospect  which was as extensive as it was delightful even the admiral  who never would confess to seeing much beauty in scenery where water formed not a large portion of it  could not resist opening his window and looking out  with a considerable degree of admiration  upon wood and dale  as they were illuminated by the moon s rays  softened  and rendered  if anything  more beautiful by the light vapours  through which they had to struggle to make their way charles holland  in order to avoid the likelihood of meeting with any one who would question him as to where he was going  determined upon leaving his room by the balcony  which  as we are aware  presented ample facilities for his so doing he cast a glance at the portrait in the panel before he left the apartment  and then saying for you  dear flora  for you i essay this meeting with the fearful original of that portrait  he immediately opened his window  and stepped out on to the balcony young and active as was charles holland  to descend from that balcony presented to him no difficulty whatever  and he was  in a very few moments  safe in the garden of bannerworth hall he never thought  for a moment  to look up  or he would  in an instant have seen the white head of his old uncle  as it was projected over the sill of the window of his chamber the drop of charles from the balcony of his window  just made sufficient noise to attract the admiral s attention  and  then  before he could think of making any alarm  he saw charles walking hastily across a grass plot  which was sufficiently in the light of the moon to enable the admiral at once to recognise him  and leave no sort of doubt as to his positive identity of course  upon discovering that it was charles  the necessity for making an alarm no longer existed  and  indeed  not knowing what it was that had induced him to leave his chamber  a moment s reflection suggested to him the propriety of not even calling to charles  lest he should defeat some discovery which he might be about to make he has heard something  or seen something  thought the admiral  and is gone to find out what it is  i only wish i was with him  but up here i can do nothing at all  that s quite clear charles  he saw  walked very rapidly  and like a man who has some fixed destination which he wishes to reach as quickly as possible when he dived among the trees which skirted one side of the flower gardens  the admiral was more puzzled than ever  and he said now where on earth is he off to  he is fully dressed  and has his cloak about him after a few moments  reflection he decided that  having seen something suspicious  charles must have got up  and dressed himself  to fathom it the moment this idea became fairly impressed upon his mind  he left his bedroom  and descended to where one of the brothers he knew was sitting up  keeping watch during the night  it was henry who was so on guard and when the admiral came into the room  he uttered an expression of surprise to find him up  for it was now some time past twelve o clock i have come to tell you that charles has left the house  said the admiral left the house yes  i saw him just now go across the garden and you are sure it was he quite sure  i saw him by the moonlight cross the green plot then you may depend he has seen or heard something  and gone alone to find out what it is rather than give any alarm that is just what i think it must be so  i will follow him  if you can show me exactly which way he went that i can easily  and in case i should have made any mistake  which it is not at all likely  we can go to his room first and see if it is empty a good thought  certainly  that will at once put an end to all doubt upon the question they both immediately proceeded to charles s room  and then the admiral s accuracy of identification of his nephew was immediately proved by finding that charles was not there  and that the window was wide open you see i am right  said the admiral you are  cried henry  but what have we here where here on the dressing table  here are no less than three letters  all laid as it on purpose to catch the eye of the first one who might enter the room indeed you perceive them henry held them to the light  and after a moment s inspection of them he said  in a voice of much surprise good god  what is the meaning of this the meaning of what the letters are addressed to parties in the house here  do you not see to whom one to admiral bell the deuce another to me  and the third to my sister flora  there is some new mystery here the admiral looked at the superscription of one of the letters which was handed to him in silent amazement  then he cried set down the light  and let us read them henry did so  and then they simultaneously opened the epistles which were severally addressed to them  there was a silence  as of the very grave  for some moments  and then the old admiral staggered to a seat as he exclaimed am i dreaming am i dreaming is this possible  said henry  in a voice of deep emotion  as he allowed the note addressed to him to drop on to the floor d n it  what does yours say  cried the old admiral  in a louder tone read it what says yours read it i m amazed the letters were exchanged  and read by each with the same breathless attention they had bestowed upon their own  after which  they both looked at each other in silence  pictures of amazement  and the most absolute state of bewilderment not to keep our readers in suspense  we at once transcribe each of these letters the one to the admiral contained these words      my dear uncle      of course you will perceive the prudence of keeping this letter      to yourself  but the fact is  i have now made up my mind to leave      bannerworth hall      flora bannerworth is not now the person she was when first i      knew her and loved her  such being the case  and she having      altered  not i  she cannot accuse me of fickleness      i still love the flora bannerworth i first knew  but i cannot      make my wife one who is subject to the visitations of a vampyre      i have remained here long enough now to satisfy myself that this      vampyre business is no delusion  i am quite convinced that it is      a positive fact  and that  after death  flora will herself become      one of the horrible existences known by that name      i will communicate to you from the first large city on the      continent whither i am going  at which i make any stay  and in      the meantime  make what excuses you like at bannerworth hall      which i advise you to leave as quickly as you can  and believe me      to be  my dear uncle  yours truly      charles holland henry s letter was this      my dear sir      if you calmly and dispassionately consider the painful and      distressing circumstances in which your family are placed  i am      sure that  far from blaming me for the step which this note will      announce to you i have taken  you will be the first to give me      credit for acting with an amount of prudence and foresight which      was highly necessary under the circumstances      if the supposed visits of a vampyre to your sister flora had      turned out  as first i hoped they would  a delusion and been      in any satisfactory manner explained away i should certainly have      felt pride and pleasure in fulfilling my engagement to that young      lady      you must  however  yourself feel that the amount of evidence in      favour of a belief that an actual vampyre has visited flora      enforces a conviction of its truth      i cannot  therefore  make her my wife under such very singular      circumstances      perhaps you may blame me for not taking at once advantage of the      permission given me to forego my engagement when first i came to      your house  but the fact is  i did not then in the least believe      in the existence of the vampyre  but since a positive conviction      of that most painful fact has now forced itself upon me  i beg to      decline the honour of an alliance which i had at one time looked      forward to with the most considerable satisfaction      i shall be on the continent as fast as conveyances can take me      therefore  should you entertain any romantic notions of calling      me to an account for a course of proceeding i think perfectly and      fully justifiable  you will not find me      accept the assurances of my respect for yourself and pity for      your sister  and believe me to be  my dear sir  your sincere      friend      charles holland these two letters might well make the admiral stare at henry bannerworth  and henry stare at him an occurrence so utterly and entirely unexpected by both of them  was enough to make them doubt the evidence of their own senses  but there were the letters  as a damning evidence of the outrageous fact  and charles holland was gone it was the admiral who first recovered from the stunning effect of the epistles  and he  with a gesture of perfect fury  exclaimed the scoundrel the cold blooded villain  i renounce him for ever  he is no nephew of mine  he is some d d imposter  nobody with a dash of my family blood in his veins would have acted so to save himself from a thousand deaths who shall we trust now  said henry  when those whom we take to our inmost hearts deceive us thus  this is the greatest shock i have yet received  if there be a pang greater than another  surely it is to be found in the faithlessness and heartlessness of one we loved and trusted he is a scoundrel  roared the admiral  d n him  he ll die on a dunghill  and that s too good a place for him  i cast him off i ll find him out  and old as i am  i ll fight him i ll wring his neck  the rascal  and  as for poor dear miss flora  god bless her  i ll i ll marry her myself  and make her an admiral i ll marry her myself  oh that i should be uncle to such a rascal calm yourself  said henry  no one can blame you yes  you can  i had no right to be his uncle  and i was an old fool to love him the old man sat down  and his voice became broken with emotion as he said sir  i tell you i would have died willingly rather than this should have happened  this will kill me now i shall die now of shame and grief tears gushed from the admiral s eyes and the sight of the noble old man s emotion did much to calm the anger of henry which  although he said but little  was boiling at his heart like a volcano admiral bell  he said  you have nothing to do with this business  we can not blame you for the heartlessness of another  i have but one favour to ask of you what what can i do say no more about him at all i can t help saying something about him  you ought to turn me out of the house heaven forbid  what for because i m his uncle his d d old fool of an uncle  that always thought so much of him nay  my good sir  that was a fault on the right side  and cannot discredit you  i thought him the most perfect of human beings oh  if i could but have guessed this it was impossible  such duplicity never was equalled in this world it was impossible to foresee it hold hold  did he give you fifty pounds what did he give you fifty pounds give me fifty pounds  most decidedly not  what made you think of such a thing because to day he borrowed fifty pounds of me  he said  to lend to you i never heard of the transaction until this moment the villain no  doubt  sir  he wanted that amount to expedite his progress abroad well  now  damme  if an angel had come to me and said hilloa  admiral bell  your nephew  charles holland  is a thundering rogue  i should have said you re a liar this is fighting against facts  my dear sir  he is gone mention him no more  forget him  as i shall endeavour myself to do  and persuade my poor sister to do poor girl  what can we say to her nothing  but give her all the letters  and let her be at once satisfied of the worthlessness of him she loved the best way  her woman s pride will then come to her help i hope it will  she is of an honourable race  and i am sure she will not condescend to shed a tear for such a man as charles holland has proved himself to be d n him  i ll find him out  and make him fight you  he shall give you satisfaction no  no no  but he shall i cannot fight with him you cannot certainly not  he is too far beneath me now  i cannot fight on honourable terms with one whom i despise as too dishonourable to contend with  i have nothing now but silence and contempt i have though  for i ll break his neck when i see him  or he shall break mine  the villain  i m ashamed to stay here  my young friend how mistaken a view you take of this matter  my dear sir  as admiral bell  a gentleman  a brave officer  and a man of the purest and most unblemished honour  you confer a distinction upon us by your presence here the admiral wrung henry by the hand  as he said to morrow wait till to morrow  we will talk over this matter to morrow i cannot to night  i have not patience  but to morrow  my dear boy  we will have it all out  god bless you  good night chapter xxvii the noble confidence of flora bannerworth in her lover her opinion of the three letters the admiral s admiration illustration to describe the feelings of henry bannerworth on the occasion of this apparent defalcation from the path of rectitude and honour by his friend  as he had fondly imagined charles holland to be  would be next to impossible if  as we have taken occasion to say  it be a positive fact  that a noble and a generous mind feels more acutely any heartlessness of this description from one on whom it has placed implicit confidence  than the most deliberate and wicked of injuries from absolute strangers  we can easily conceive that henry bannerworth was precisely the person to feel most acutely the conduct which all circumstances appeared to fix upon charles holland  upon whose faith  truth  and honour  he would have staked his very existence but a few short hours before with such a bewildered sensation that he scarcely knew where he walked or whither to betake himself  did he repair to his own chamber  and there he strove  with what energy he was able to bring to the task  to find out some excuses  if he could  for charles s conduct  but he could find none  view it in what light he would  it presented but a picture of the most heartless selfishness it had ever been his lot to encounter the tone of the letters  too  which charles had written  materially aggravated the moral delinquency of which he had been guilty  belief far better  had he not attempted an excuse at all than have attempted such excuses as were there put down in those epistles a more cold blooded  dishonourable proceeding could not possibly be conceived it would appear  that while he entertained a doubt with regard to the reality of the visitation of the vampyre to flora bannerworth  he had been willing to take to himself abundance of credit for the most honourable feelings  and to induce a belief in the minds of all that an exalted feeling of honour  as well as a true affection that would know no change  kept him at the feet of her whom he loved like some braggart  who  when there is no danger  is a very hero  but who  the moment he feels convinced he will be actually and truly called upon for an exhibition of his much vaunted prowess  had charles holland deserted the beautiful girl who  if anything  had now certainly  in her misfortunes  a far higher claim upon his kindly feeling than before henry could not sleep  although  at the request of george  who offered to keep watch for him the remainder of the night he attempted to do so he in vain said to himself  i will banish from my mind this most unworthy subject  i have told admiral bell that contempt is the only feeling i can now have for his nephew  and yet i now find myself dwelling upon him  and upon his conduct  with a perseverance which is a foe to my repose at length came the welcome and beautiful light of day  and henry rose fevered and unrefreshed his first impulse now was to hold a consultation with his brother george  as to what was to be done  and george advised that mr marchdale  who as yet knew nothing of the matter  should be immediately informed of it  and consulted  as being probably better qualified than either of them to come to a just  a cool  and a reasonable opinion upon the painful circumstance  which it could not be expected that either of them would be able to view calmly let it be so  then  said henry  mr  marchdale shall decide for us they at once sought this friend of the family  who was in his own bed room  and when henry knocked at the door  marchdale opened it hurriedly  eagerly inquiring what was the matter there is no alarm  said henry  we have only come to tell you of a circumstance which has occurred during the night  and which will somewhat surprise you nothing calamitous  i hope vexatious  and yet  i think it is a matter upon which we ought almost to congratulate ourselves  read those two letters  and give us your candid opinion upon them henry placed in mr  marchdale s hands the letter addressed to himself as well as that to the admiral marchdale read them both with marked attention  but he did not exhibit in his countenance so much surprise as regret when he had finished  henry said to him well  marchdale  what think you of this new and extraordinary episode in our affairs my dear young friends  said marchdale  in a voice of great emotion  i know not what to say to you  i have no doubt but that you are both of you much astonished at the receipt of these letters  and equally so at the sudden absence of charles holland and are not you not so much as you  doubtless  are  the fact is  i never did entertain a favourable opinion of the young man  and he knew it  i have been accustomed to the study of human nature under a variety of aspects  i have made it a matter of deep  and i may add  sorrowful  contemplation to study and remark those minor shades of character which commonly escape observation wholly  and  i repeat  i always had a bad opinion of charles holland  which he guessed  and hence he conceived a hatred to me  which more than once  as you cannot but remember  showed itself in little acts of opposition and hostility you much surprise me i expected to do so  but you cannot help remembering that at one time i was on the point of leaving here solely on his account you were so indeed i should have done so  but that i reasoned with myself upon the subject  and subdued the impulse of the anger which some years ago  when i had not seen so much of the world  would have guided me but why did you not impart to us your suspicions  we should at least then  have been prepared for such a contingency as has occurred place yourself in my position  and then yourself what you would have done  suspicion is one of those hideous things which all men should be most specially careful not only how they entertain at all  but how they give expression to  besides  whatever may be the amount of one s own internal conviction with regard to the character of any one  there is just a possibility that one may be wrong true  true that possibility ought to keep any one silent who has nothing but suspicion to go upon  however cautious it may make him  as regards his dealings with the individual  i only suspected from little minute shades of character  that would peep out in spite of him  that charles holland was not the honourable man he would fain have had everybody believe him to be and had you from the first such a feeling i had it is very strange yes  and what is more strange still  is that he from the first seemed to know it  and despite a caution which i could see he always kept uppermost in his thoughts  he could not help speaking tartly to me at times i have noticed that  said george you may depend it is a fact  added marchdale  that nothing so much excites the deadly and desperate hatred of a man who is acting a hypocritical part  as the suspicion  well grounded or not  that another sees and understands the secret impulses of his dishonourable heart i cannot blame you  or any one else  mr  marchdale  said henry  that you did not give utterance to your secret thoughts  but i do wish that you had done so nay  dear henry  replied mr  marchdale  believe me  i have made this matter a subject of deep thought  and have abundance of reasons why i ought not to have spoken to you upon the subject indeed indeed i have  and not among the least important is the one  that if i had acquainted you with my suspicions  you would have found yourself in the painful position of acting a hypocritical part yourself towards this charles holland  for you must either have kept the secret that he was suspected  or you must have shewn it to him by your behaviour well  well  i dare say  marchdale  you acted for the best  what shall we do now can you doubt i was thinking of letting flora at once know the absolute and complete worthlessness of her lover  so that she could have no difficulty in at once tearing herself from him by the assistance of the natural pride which would surely come to her aid  upon finding herself so much deceived the test may be possible you think so i do  indeed here is a letter  which of course remains unopened  addressed to flora by charles holland  the admiral rather thought it would hurt her feelings to deliver her such an epistle  but i must confess i am of a contrary opinion upon that point  and think now the more evidence she has of the utter worthlessness of him who professed to love her with so much disinterested affection  the better it will be for her you could not  possibly  henry  have taken a more sensible view of the subject i am glad you agree with me no reasonable man could do otherwise  and from what i have seen of admiral bell  i am sure  upon reflection  he will be of the same opinion then it shall be so  the first shock to poor flora may be severe  but we shall then have the consolation of knowing that it is the only one and that in knowing the very worst  she has no more on that score to apprehend  alas  alas  the hand of misfortune now appears to have pressed heavily upon us indeed  what in the name of all that is unlucky and disastrous  will happen next  i wonder what can happen  said marchdale  i think you have now got rid of the greatest evil of all a false friend we have  indeed go  then  to flora  assure her that in the affection of others who know no falsehood  she will find a solace from every ill  assure her that there are hearts that will place themselves between her and every misfortune mr  marchdale was much affected as he spoke  probably he felt deeper than he chose to express the misfortunes of that family for whom he entertained so much friendship  he turned aside his head to hide the traces of emotion which  despite even his great powers of self command would shew themselves upon his handsome and intelligent countenance then it appeared as if his noble indignation had got  for a few brief moments  the better of all prudence  and he exclaimed the villain  the worse than villain  who would  with a thousand artifices  make himself beloved by a young  unsuspecting  and beautiful girl  but then to leave her to the bitterness of regret  that she had ever given such a man a place in her esteem  the heartless ruffian be calm  mr  marchdale  i pray you be calm  said george  i never saw you so much moved excuse me  he said  excuse me  i am much moved  and i am human  i cannot always  let me strive my utmost  place a curb upon my feelings they are feelings which do you honour nay  nay  i am foolish to have suffered myself to be led away into such a hasty expression of them  i am accustomed to feel acutely and to feel deeply  but it is seldom i am so much overcome as this will you accompany us to the breakfast room at once  mr  marchdale where we will make this communication to flora  you will then be able to judge by her manner of receiving it  what it will be best to say to her come  then  and pray be calm  the least that is said upon this painful and harassing subject  after this morning  will be the best you are right you are right mr  marchdale hastily put on his coat  he was dressed  with the exception of that one article of apparel  when the brothers came to his chamber  and then he came to the breakfast parlour where the painful communication was to be made to flora of her lover s faithlessness flora was already seated in that apartment  indeed  she had been accustomed to meet charles holland there before others of the family made their appearance  but  alas  this morning the kind and tender lover was not there the expression that sat upon the countenances of her brothers  and of mr  marchdale  was quite sufficient to convince her that something more serious than usual had occurred  and she at the moment turned very pale marchdale observed this change of change of countenance in her  and he advanced towards her  saying calm yourself  flora  we have something to communicate to you  but it is a something which should excite indignation  and no other feeling  in your breast brother  what is the meaning of this  said flora  turning aside from marchdale  and withdrawing the hand which he would have taken i would rather have admiral bell here before i say anything  said henry  regarding a matter in which he cannot but feel much interested personally here he is  said the admiral  who at that moment had opened the door of the breakfast room  here he is  so now fire away  and don t spare the enemy and charles  said flora  where is charles d n charles  cried the admiral  who had not been much accustomed to control his feelings hush  hush  said henry  my dear sir  hush  do not indulge now in any invectives  flora  here are three letters  you will see that the one which is unopened is addressed to yourself  however  we wish you to read the whole three of them  and then to form your own free and unbiased opinion flora looked as pale as a marble statue  when she took the letters into her hands  she let the two that were open fall on the table before her while she eagerly broke the seal of that which was addressed to herself illustration henry  with an instinctive delicacy  beckoned every one present to the window  so that flora had not the pain of feeling that any eyes were fixed upon her but those of her mother  who had just come into the room while she was perusing those documents which told such a tale of heartless dissimulation my dear child  said mrs  bannerworth  you are ill hush  mother hush  said flora  let me know all she read the whole of the letters through  and then  as the last one dropped from her grasp  she exclaimed oh  god  oh  god  what is all that has occurred compared to this charles charles charles flora  exclaimed henry  suddenly turning from the window  flora  is this worthy of you heaven now support me is this worthy of the name you bear flora  i should have thought  and i did hope  that woman s pride would have supported you let me implore you  added marchdale  to summon indignation to your aid  miss bannerworth charles charles charles  she again exclaimed  as she wrung her hands despairingly flora  if anything could add a sting to my already irritated feelings said henry  this conduct of yours would henry brother  what mean you  are you mad are you  flora god  i wish now that i was you have read those letters  and yet you call upon the name of him who wrote them with frantic tenderness yes  yes  she cried  frantic tenderness is the word  it is with frantic tenderness i call upon his name  and ever will charles charles dear charles this surpasses all belief  said marchdale it is the frenzy of grief  added george  but i did not expect it of her  flora flora  think again think think the rush of thought distracts  whence came these letters where did you find these most disgraceful forgeries forgeries  exclaimed henry  and he staggered back  as if someone had struck him a blow yes  forgeries  screamed flora  what has become of charles holland has he been murdered by some secret enemy  and then these most vile fabrications made up in his name  oh  charles  charles  are you lost to me for ever good god  said henry  i did not think of that madness madness  cried marchdale hold  shouted the admiral  let me speak to her he pushed every one aside  and advanced to flora  he seized both her hands in his own  and in a tone of voice that was struggling with feeling  he cried look at me  my dear  i m an old man old enough to be your grandfather so you needn t mind looking me steadily in the face  look at me  i want to ask you a question flora raised her beautiful eyes  and looked the old weather beaten admiral full in the face oh  what a striking contrast did those two persons present to each other  that young and beautiful girl  with her small  delicate childlike hands clasped  and completely hidden in the huge ones of the old sailor  the white  smooth skin contrasting wonderfully with his wrinkled  hardened features my dear  he cried  you have read those those d d letters  my dear i have  sir and what do you think of them they were not written by charles holland  your nephew a choking sensation seemed to come over the old man  and he tried to speak  but in vain  he shook the hands of the young girl violently until he saw that he was hurting her  and then  before she could be aware of what he was about  he gave her a kiss on the cheek  as he cried god bless you god bless you  you are the sweetest  dearest little creature that ever was  or that ever will be  and i m a d d old fool that s what i am  these letters were not written by my nephew  charles he is incapable of writing them  and  d n me  i shall take shame to myself as long as i live for ever thinking so dear sir  said flora  who somehow or another did not seem at all offended at the kiss which the old man had given her  dear sir  how could you believe  for one moment  that they came from him  there has been some desperate villany on foot  where is he oh  find him  if he be yet alive  if they who have thus striven to steal from him that honour  which is the jewel of his heart  have murdered him  seek them out  sir  in the sacred name of justice  i implore you i will i will  i don t renounce him  he is my nephew still charles holland my own dear sister s son  and you are the best girl  god bless you  that ever breathed  he loved you he loves you still  and if he s above ground  poor fellow  he shall yet tell you himself he never saw those infamous letters you you will seek for him  sobbed flora  and the tears gushed from her eyes  upon you  sir  who  as i do  feel assured of his innocence  i alone rely  if all the world say he is guilty  we will not think so i m d d if we do henry had sat down by the table  and  with his hands clasped together seemed in an agony of thought he was now roused by a thump on the back by the admiral  who cried what do you think  now  old fellow  d n it  things look a little different now as god is my judge  said henry  holding up his hands  i know not what to think  but my heart and feelings all go with you and with flora  in your opinion of the innocence of charles holland i knew you would say that  because you could not possibly help it  my dear boy  now we are all right again  and all we have got to do is to find out which way the enemy has gone  and then give chase to him mr  marchdale  what do you think of this new suggestion  said george to that gentleman pray  excuse me  was his reply  i would much rather not be called upon to give an opinion why  what do you mean by that  said the admiral precisely what i say  sir d n me  we had a fellow once in the combined fleets  who never had an opinion till after something had happened  and then he always said that was just what he thought i was never in the combined  or any other fleet  sir  said marchdale coldly who the devil said you were  roared the admiral marchdale merely hawed however  added the admiral  i don t care  and never did  for anybody s opinion  when i know i am right  i d back this dear girl here for opinions  and good feelings  and courage to express them  against all the world  i would  any day  if i was not the old hulk i am  i would take a cruise in any latitude under the sun  if it was only for the chance of meeting with just such another oh  lose no time  said flora  if charles is not to be found in the house  lose no time in searching for him  i pray you  seek him  wherever there is the remotest probability he may chance to be  do not let him think he is deserted not a bit of it  cried the admiral  you make your mind easy  my dear if he s above ground  we shall find him out  you may depend upon it come along master henry  you and i will consider what had best be done in this uncommonly ugly matter henry and george followed the admiral from the breakfast room  leaving marchdale there  who looked serious and full of melancholy thought it was quite clear that he considered flora had spoken from the generous warmth of her affection as regarded charles holland  and not from the convictions which reason would have enforced her to feel when he was now alone with her and mrs  bannerworth  he spoke in a feeling and affectionate tone regarding the painful and inexplicable events which had transpired chapter xxviii mr  marchdale s exculpation of himself the search through the gardens the spot of the deadly struggle the mysterious paper illustration it was  perhaps  very natural that  with her feelings towards charles holland  flora should shrink from every one who seemed to be of a directly contrary impression  and when mr  marchdale now spoke  she showed but little inclination to hear what he had to say in explanation the genuine and unaffected manner  however  in which he spoke  could not but have its effect upon her  and she found herself compelled to listen as well as  to a great extent  approve of the sentiments that fell from his lips flora  he said  i beg that you will here  in the presence of your mother  give me a patient hearing  you fancy that  because i cannot join so glibly as the admiral in believing that these letters are forgeries i must be your enemy those letters  said flora  were not written by charles holland that is your opinion it is more than an opinion  he could not write them well  then  of course  if i felt inclined  which heaven alone knows i do not  i could not hope successfully to argue against such a conviction  but i do not wish to do so  all i want to impress upon you is  that i am not to be blamed for doubting his innocence  and  at the same time  i wish to assure you that no one in this house would feel more exquisite satisfaction than i in seeing it established i thank you for so much  said flora  but as  to my mind  his innocence has never been doubted  it needs to me no establishing very good  you believe these letters forgeries i do and that the disappearance of charles holland is enforced  and not of his own free will i do then you may rely upon my unremitting exertions night and day to find him and any suggestion you can make  which is likely to aid in the search  shall  i pledge myself  be fully carried out i thank you  mr  marchdale my dear  said the mother  rely on mr  marchdale i will rely on any one who believe charles holland innocent of writing those odious letters  mother i rely upon the admiral  he will aid me heart and hand and so will mr  marchdale i am glad to hear it and yet doubt it  flora  said marchdale  dejectedly  i am very sorry that such should be the case  i will not  however  trouble you any further  nor  give me leave to assure you  will i relax in my honest endeavours to clear up this mystery so saying  mr  marchdale bowed  and left the room  apparently more vexed than he cared to express at the misconstruction which had been put upon his conduct and motives  he at once sought henry and the admiral  to whom he expressed his most earnest desire to aid in attempting to unravel the mysterious circumstances which had occurred this strongly expressed opinion of flora  he remarked  is of course amply sufficient to induce us to pause before we say one word more that shall in any way sound like a condemnation of mr  holland  heaven forbid that i should no  said the admiral  don t i do not intend i would not advise anybody sir  if you use that as a threat a threat yes  i must say  it sounded marvellously like one oh  dear  no quite a mistake  i consider that every man has a fair right to the enjoyment of his opinion  all i have to remark is  that i shall  after what has occurred  feel myself called upon to fight anybody who says those letters were written by my nephew indeed  sir ah  indeed you will permit me to say such is a strange mode of allowing every one the free enjoyment of his opinion not at all whatever pains and penalties may be the result  admiral bell  of differing with so infallible authority as yourself  i shall do so whenever my judgment induces me you will indeed i will very good  you know the consequences as to fighting you  i should refuse to do so refuse yes  most certainly upon what ground upon the ground that you were a madman come  now interposed henry  let me hope that  for my sake as well as for flora s  this dispute will proceed no further i have not courted it  said marchdale  i have much temper  but i am not a stick or a stone d e  if i don t think  said the admiral  you are a bit of both mr  henry bannerworth  said marchdale  i am your guest  and but for the duty i feel in assisting in the search for mr  charles holland  i should at once leave your house you need not trouble yourself on my account  said the admiral  if i find no clue to him in the neighbourhood for two or three days  i shall be off myself i am going  said henry  rising  to search the garden and adjoining meadows  if you two gentlemen choose to come with me  i shall of course be happy of your company  if  however  you prefer remaining here to wrangle  you can do so this had the effect  at all events  of putting a stop to the dispute for the present  and both the admiral and mr  marchdale accompanied henry on his search  that search was commenced immediately under the balcony of charles holland s window  from which the admiral had seen him emerge there was nothing particular found there  or in the garden  admiral bell pointed out accurately the route he had seen charles take across the grass plot just before he himself left his chamber to seek henry accordingly  this route was now taken  and it led to a low part of the garden wall  which any one of ordinary vigour could easily have surmounted my impression is  said the admiral  that he got over here the ivy appears to be disturbed  remarked henry suppose we mark the spot  and then go round to it on the outer side suggested george this was agreed to  for  although the young man might have chosen rather to clamber over the wall than go round  it was doubtful if the old admiral could accomplish such a feat the distance round  however  was not great  and as they had cast over the wall a handful of flowers from the garden to mark the precise spot it was easily discoverable the moment they reached it  they were panic stricken by the appearances which it presented  the grass was for some yards round about completely trodden up  and converted into mud  there were deep indentations of feet marks in all directions  and such abundance of evidence that some most desperate struggle had recently taken place there  that the most sceptical person in the world could not have entertained any doubt upon the subject henry was the first to break the silence with which they each regarded the broken ground this is conclusive to my mind  he said  with a deep sigh  here has poor charles been attacked god keep him  exclaimed marchdale  and pardon me my doubts i am now convinced the old admiral gazed about him like one distracted  suddenly he cried they have murdered him  some fiends in the shape of men have murdered him  and heaven only knows for what it seems but too probable  said henry  let us endeavour to trace the footsteps  oh  flora  flora  what terrible news this will be to you a horrible supposition comes across my mind  said george  what if he met the vampyre it may have been so  said marchdale  with a shudder  it is a point which we should endeavour to ascertain  and i think we may do so how by some inquiry as to whether sir francis varney was from home at midnight last night true  that might be done the question  suddenly put to one of his servants  would  most probably  be answered as a thing of course it would then that shall be decided upon  and now  my friends  since you have some of you thought me luke warm in this business  i pledge myself that should it be ascertained that varney was from home at midnight last evening  i will defy him personally  and meet him hand to hand nay  nay  said henry  leave that course to younger hands why so it more befits me to be his challenger no  henry  you are differently situated to what i am how so remember  that i am in the world a lone man  without ties or connexions  if i lose my life  i compromise no one by my death  but you have a mother and a bereaved sister to look to who will deserve your care hilloa  cried the admiral  what s this what  cried each  eagerly  and they pressed forward to where the admiral was stooping to the ground to pick up something which was nearly completely trodden into the grass he with some difficulty raised it  it was a small slip of paper  on which was some writing  but it was so much covered with mud as not to be legible if this be washed  said henry  i think we shall be able to read it clearly we can soon try that experiment  said george  and as the footsteps by some mysterious means  show themselves nowhere else but in this one particular spot  any further pursuit of inquiry about here appears useless then we will return to the house  said henry  and wash the mud from this paper there is one important point  remarked marchdale  which it appears to me we have all overlooked indeed yes what may that be it is this  is any one here sufficiently acquainted with the handwriting of mr  charles holland to come to an opinion upon the letters i have some letters from him  said henry  which we received while on the continent  and i dare say flora has likewise then they should be compared with the alleged forgeries i know his handwriting well  said the admiral  the letters bear so strong a resemblance to it that they would deceive anybody then you may depend  remarked henry  some most deep laid and desperate plot is going on i begin  added marchdale  to dread that such must be the case  what say you to claiming the assistance of the authorities  as well as offering a large reward for any information regarding mr  charles holland no plan shall be left untried  you may depend they had now reached the house  and henry having procured some clean water  carefully washed the paper which had been found among the trodden grass  when freed from the mixture of clay and mud which had obscured it  they made out the following words it be so well  at the next full moon seek a convenient spot  and it can be done  the signature is  to my apprehension  perfect  the money which i hold  in my opinion  is much more in amount than you imagine must be ours  and as for here the paper was torn across  and no further words were visible upon it mystery seemed now to be accumulating upon mystery  each one  as it showed itself darkly  seeming to bear some remote relation to what preceded it  and yet only confusing it the more that this apparent scrap of a letter had dropped from some one s pocket during the fearful struggle  of which there were such ample evidences was extremely probable  but what it related to  by whom it was written or by whom dropped  were unfathomable mysteries in fact  no one could give an opinion upon these matters at all  and after a further series of conjectures  it could only be decided  that unimportant as the scrap of paper appeared now to be  it should be preserved  in case it should  as there was a dim possibility that it might become a connecting link in some chain of evidence at another time and here we are  said henry  completely at fault  and knowing not what to do well  it is a hard case  said the admiral  that  with all the will in the world to be up and doing something  we are lying here like a fleet of ships in a calm  as idle as possible you perceive we have no evidence to connect sir francis varney with this affair  either nearly or remotely  said marchdale certainly not  replied henry but yet  i hope you will not lose sight of the suggestion i proposed to the effect of ascertaining if he were from home last night but how is that to be carried out boldly how boldly by going at once  i should advise  to his house  and asking the first one of his domestics you may happen to see i will go over  cried george  on such occasions as these one cannot act upon ceremony he seized his hat  and without waiting for a word from any one approving or condemning his going  off he went if  said henry  we find that varney has nothing to do with the matter  we are completely at fault completely  echoed marchdale in that case  admiral  i think we ought to defer to your feelings upon the subject  and do whatever you suggest should be done i shall offer a hundred pounds reward to any one who can and will bring any news of charles a hundred pounds is too much  said marchdale not at all  and while i am about it  since the amount is made a subject of discussion  i shall make it two hundred  and that may benefit some rascal who is not so well paid for keeping the secret as i will pay him for disclosing it perhaps you are right  said marchdale i know i am  as i always am marchdale could not forbear a smile at the opinionated old man  who thought no one s opinion upon any subject at all equal to his own  but he made no remark  and only waited  as did henry  with evident anxiety for the return of george the distance was not great  and george certainly performed his errand quickly  for he was back in less time than they had thought he could return in  the moment he came into the room  he said  without waiting for any inquiry to be made of him we are at fault again  i am assured that sir francis varney never stirred from home after eight o clock last evening d n it  then  said the admiral  let us give the devil his due  he could not have had any hand in this business certainly not from whom  george  did you get your information  asked henry  in a desponding tone from  first of all  one of his servants  whom i met away from the house  and then from one whom i saw at the house there can be no mistake  then certainly none  the servants answered me at once  and so frankly that i cannot doubt it the door of the room was slowly opened  and flora came in  she looked almost the shadow of what she had been but a few weeks before  she was beautiful  but she almost realised the poet s description of one who had suffered much  and was sinking into an early grave  the victim of a broken heart       she was more beautiful than death       and yet as sad to look upon her face was of a marble paleness  and as she clasped her hands  and glanced from face to face  to see if she could gather hope and consolation from the expression of any one  she might have been taken for some exquisite statue of despair have you found him  she said  have you found charles flora  flora  said henry  as he approached her nay  answer me  have you found him  you went to seek him  dead or alive  have you found him we have not  flora then i must seek him myself  none will search for him as i will search i must myself seek him  tis true affection that can alone be successful in such a search believe me  dear flora  that all has been done which the shortness of the time that has elapsed would permit  further measures will now immediately be taken  rest assured  dear sister  that all will be done that the utmost zeal can suggest they have killed him  they have killed him  she said  mournfully  oh god  they have killed him  i am not now mad  but the time will come when i must surely be maddened  the vampyre has killed charles holland the dreadful vampyre nay  now  flora  this is frenzy because he loved me has he been destroyed  i know it  i know it  the vampyre has doomed me to destruction  i am lost  and all who loved me will be involved in one common ruin on my account  leave me all of you to perish  if  for iniquities done in our family  some one must suffer to appease the divine vengeance  let that one be me  and only me hush  sister  hush  cried henry  i expected not this from you  the expressions you use are not your expressions  i know you better  there is abundance of divine mercy  but no divine vengeance  be calm  i pray you calm  calm yes  make an exertion of that intellect we all know you to possess  it is too common a thing with human nature  when misfortune overtakes it to imagine that such a state of things is specially arranged  we quarrel with providence because it does not interfere with some special miracle in our favour  forgetting that  being denizens of this earth  and members of a great social system  we must be subject occasionally to the accidents which will disturb its efficient working oh  brother  brother  she exclaimed  as she dropped into a seat  you have never loved indeed no  you have never felt what it was to hold your being upon the breath of another  you can reason calmly  because you cannot know the extent of feeling you are vainly endeavouring to combat flora  you do me less than justice  all i wish to impress upon your mind is  that you are not in any way picked out by providence to be specially unhappy that there is no perversion of nature on your account call you that hideous vampyre form that haunts me no perversion of ordinary nature what is is natural  said marchdale cold reasoning to one who suffers as i suffer  i cannot argue with you i can only know that i am most unhappy most miserable but that will pass away  sister  and the sun of your happiness may smile again oh  if i could but hope and wherefore should you deprive yourself of that poorest privilege of the most unhappy because my heart tells me to despair tell it you won t  then  cried admiral bell  if you had been at sea as long as i have  miss bannerworth  you would never despair of anything at all providence guarded you  said marchdale yes  that s true enough  i dare say  i was in a storm once off cape ushant  and it was only through providence  and cutting away the mainmast myself  that we succeeded in getting into port you have one hope  said marchdale to flora  as he looked in her wan face one hope yes  recollect you have one hope what is that you think that  by removing from this place  you may find that peace which is here denied you no  no  no indeed  i thought that such was your firm conviction it was  but circumstances have altered how charles holland has disappeared here  and here must i remain to seek for him true he may have disappeared here  remarked marchdale  and yet that may be no argument for supposing him still here where  then  is he god knows how rejoiced i should be if i were able to answer your question  i must seek him  dead or alive  i must see him yet before i bid adieu to this world  which has now lost all its charms for me do not despair  said henry  i will go to the town now at once  to make known our suspicions that he has met with some foul play  i will set every means in operation that i possibly can to discover him  mr chillingworth will aid me  too  and i hope that not many days will elapse  flora  before some intelligence of a most satisfactory nature shall be brought to you on charles holland s account go  go  brother  go at once i go now at once shall i accompany you  said marchdale no  remain here to keep watch over flora s safety while i am gone  i can alone do all that can be done and don t forget to offer the two hundred pounds reward  said the admiral  to any one who can bring us news of charles  on which we can rely i will not surely surely something must result from that  said flora  as she looked in the admiral s face  as if to gather encouragement in her dawning hopes from its expression of course it will  my dear  he said  don t you be downhearted  you and i are of one mind in this affair  and of one mind we will keep  we won t give up our opinions for anybody our opinions  she said  of the honour and honesty of charles holland that is what we will adhere to of course we will ah  sir  it joys me  even in the midst of this  my affliction  to find one at least who is determined to do him full justice  we cannot find such contradictions in nature as that a mind  full of noble impulses should stoop to such a sudden act of selfishness as those letters would attribute to charles holland  it cannot cannot be you are right  my dear  and now  master henry  you be off  will you  if you please i am off now  farewell  flora  for a brief space farewell  brother  and heaven speed you on your errand amen to that  cried the admiral  and now  my dear  if you have got half an hour to spare  just tuck your arm under mine  and take a walk with me in the garden  for i want to say something to you most willingly  said flora i would not advise you to stray far from the house  miss bannerworth said marchdale nobody asked you for advice  said the admiral  d e  do you want to make out that i ain t capable of taking care of her no  no  but oh  nonsense  come along  my dear  and if all the vampyres and odd fish that were ever created were to come across our path  we would settle them somehow or another  come along  and don t listen to anybody s croaking chapter xxix a peep through an iron grating the lonely prisoner in his dungeon the mystery illustration without forestalling the interest of our story  or recording a fact in its wrong place  we now call our readers  attention to a circumstance which may  at all events  afford some food for conjecture some distance from the hall  which  from time immemorial  had been the home and the property of the bannerworth family  was an ancient ruin known by the name of the monks  hall it was conjectured that this ruin was the remains of some one of those half monastic  half military buildings which  during the middle ages were so common in almost every commanding situation in every county of england at a period of history when the church arrogated to itself an amount of political power which the intelligence of the spirit of the age now denies to it  and when its members were quite ready to assert at any time the truth of their doctrines by the strong arm of power  such buildings as the one  the old grey ruins of which were situated near to bannerworth hall  were erected ostensibly for religious purposes  but really as a stronghold for defence  as well as for aggression  this monks  hall  as it was called partook quite as much of the character of a fortress  as of an ecclesiastical building the ruins covered a considerable extent  of ground  but the only part which seemed successfully to have resisted the encroaches of time  at least to a considerable extent  was a long  hall in which the jolly monks no doubt feasted and caroused adjoining to this hall  were the walls of other parts of the building and at several places there were small  low  mysterious looking doors that led  heaven knows where  into some intricacies and labyrinths beneath the building  which no one had  within the memory of man  been content to run the risk of losing himself in illustration it was related that among these subterranean passages and arches there were pitfalls and pools of water  and whether such a statement was true or not  it certainly acted as a considerable damper upon the vigour of curiosity this ruin was so well known in the neighbourhood  and had become from earliest childhood so familiar to the inhabitants of bannerworth hall that one would as soon expect an old inhabitant of ludgate hill to make some remark about st  paul s  as any of them to allude to the ruins of monks  hall they never now thought of going near to it  for in infancy they had spoiled among its ruins  and it had become one of those familiar objects which  almost  from that very familiarity  cease to hold a place in the memories of those who know it so well it is  however  to this ruin we would now conduct our readers  premising that what we have to say concerning it now  is not precisely in the form of a connected portion of our narrative                                    it is evening the evening of that first day of heart loneliness to poor flora bannerworth  the lingering rays of the setting sun are gilding the old ruins with a wondrous beauty  the edges of the decayed stones seem now to be tipped with gold  and as the rich golden refulgence of light gleams upon the painted glass which still adorned a large window of the hall  a flood of many coloured beautiful light was cast within  making the old flag stones  with which the interior was paved  look more like some rich tapestry  laid down to do honour to a monarch so picturesque and so beautiful an aspect did the ancient ruin wear that to one with a soul to appreciate the romantic and the beautiful  it would have amply repaid the fatigue of a long journey now to see it and as the sun sank to rest  the gorgeous colours that it cast upon the mouldering wall  deepened from an appearance of burnished gold to a crimson hue  and from that again the colour changed to a shifting purple  mingling with the shadows of the evening  and so gradually fading away into absolute darkness the place is as silent as the tomb a silence far more solemn than could have existed  had there been no remains of a human habitation  because even these time worn walls were suggestive of what once had been  and the wrapt stillness which now pervaded them brought with them a melancholy feeling for the past there was not even the low hum of insect life to break the stillness of these ancient ruins and now the last rays of the sun are gradually fading away  in a short time all will be darkness  a low gentle wind is getting up  and beginning slightly to stir the tall blades of grass that have shot up between some of the old stones  the silence is broken  awfully broken by a sudden cry of despair  such a cry as might come from some imprisoned spirit  doomed to waste an age of horror in a tomb and yet it was scarcely to be called a scream  and not all a groan  it might have come from some one on the moment of some dreadful sacrifice when the judgment had not sufficient time to call courage to its aid but involuntarily had induced that sound which might not be repeated a few startled birds flew from odd holes and corners about the ruins  to seek some other place of rest  the owl hooted from a corner of what had once been a belfry  and a dreamy looking bat flew out from a cranny and struck itself headlong against a projection then all was still again  silence resumed its reign  and if there had been a mortal ear to drink in that sudden sound  the mind might well have doubted if fancy had not more to do with the matter than reality from out a portion of the ruins that was enveloped in the deepest gloom there now glides a figure  it is of gigantic height  and it moves along with a slow and measured tread  an ample mantle envelopes the form which might well have been taken for the spirit of one of the monks who centuries since  had made that place their home it walked the whole length of the ample hall we have alluded to  and then  at the window from which had streamed the long flood of many coloured light  it paused for more than ten minutes this mysterious looking figure there stood at length there passed something on the outside of the window  that looked like the shadow of a human form then the tall  mysterious  apparition looking man turned  and sought a side entrance to the hall then he paused  and  in about a minute  he was joined by another who must have been he who had so recently passed the stained glass window on the outer side there was a friendly salutation between these two beings  and they walked to the centre of the hall  where they remained for some time in animated conversation from the gestures they used  it was evident that the subject of their discourse was one of deep and absorbing interest to both  it was one too  upon which  after a time  they seemed a little to differ  and more than once they each assumed attitudes of mutual defiance this continued until the sun had so completely sunk  that twilight was beginning sensibly to wane  and then gradually the two men appeared to have come to a better understanding  and whatever might be the subject of their discourse  there was some positive result evidently arrived at now they spoke in lower tones  they used less animated gestures than before and  after a time  they both walked slowly down the hull towards the dark spot from whence the first tall figure had so mysteriously emerged                                    there it a dungeon damp and full of the most unwholesome exhalations deep under ground it seems  and  in its excavations  it would appear as if some small land springs had been liberated  for the earthen floor was one continued extent of moisture from the roof  too  came perpetually the dripping of water  which fell with sullen  startling splashes in the pool below at one end  and near to the roof so near that to reach it  without the most efficient means from the inside  was a matter of positive impossibility is a small iron grating  and not much larger than might be entirely obscured by any human face that might be close to it from the outside of the dungeon that dreadful abode is tenanted  in one corner  on a heap of straw which appears freshly to have been cast into the place  lies a hopeless prisoner it is no great stretch of fancy to suppose  that it is from his lips came the sound of terror and of woe that had disturbed the repose of that lonely spot the prisoner is lying on his back  a rude bandage round his head  on which were numerous spots of blood  would seem to indicate that he had suffered personal injury in some recent struggle  his eyes were open they were fixed desparingly  perhaps unconsciously  upon that small grating which looked into the upper world that grating slants upwards  and looks to the west  so that any one confined in that dreary dungeon might be tantalized  on a sweet summer s day  by seeing the sweet blue sky  and occasionally the white clouds flitting by in that freedom which he cannot hope for the carol of a bird  too  might reach him there  alas  sad remembrance of life  and joy  and liberty but now all is deepening gloom  the prisoner sees nothing hears nothing  and the sky is not quite dark  that small grating looks like a strange light patch in the dungeon wall hark  some footstep sounds upon his ear  the creaking of a door follows a gleam of light shines into the dungeon  and the tall mysterious looking figure in the cloak stands before the occupant of that wretched place then comes in the other man  and he carries in his hand writing materials  he stoops to the stone couch on which the prisoner lies  and offers him a pen  as he raises him partially from the miserable damp pallet but there is no speculation in the eyes of that oppressed man  in vain the pen is repeatedly placed in his grasp  and a document of some length  written on parchment  spread out before him to sign  in vain is he held up now by both the men  who have thus mysteriously sought him in his dungeon  he has not power to do as they would wish him  the pen falls from his nerveless grasp  and  with a deep sigh  when they cease to hold him up  he falls heavily back upon the stone couch then the two men looked at each other for about a minute silently  after which he who was the shorter of the two raised one hand  and  in a voice of such concentrated hatred and passion as was horrible to hear  he said d n the reply of the other was a laugh  and then he took the light from the floor  and motioned the one who seemed so little able to control his feelings of bitterness and disappointment to leave the place with him with a haste and vehemence  then  which showed how much angered he was the shorter man of the two now rolled up the parchment  and placed it in a breast pocket of his coat he cast a withering look of intense hatred on the form of the nearly unconscious prisoner  and then prepared to follow the other but when they reached the door of the dungeon  the taller man of the two paused  and appeared for a moment or two to be in deep thought  after which he handed the lamp he carried to his companion  and approached the pallet of the prisoner he took from his pocket a small bottle  and  raising the head of the feeble and wounded man  he poured some portion of the contents into his mouth  and watched him swallow it the other looked on in silence  and then they both slowly left the dreary dungeon   the wind rose  and the night had deepened into the utmost darkness  the blackness of a night  unillumined by the moon  which would not now rise for some hours  was upon the ancient ruins  all was calm and still  and no one would have supposed that aught human was within those ancient dreary looking walls time will show who it was who lay in that unwholesome dungeon  as well as who were they who visited him so mysteriously  and retired again with feelings of such evident disappointment with the document it seemed of such importance  at least to one of them  to get that unconscious man to sign chapter xxx the visit of flora to the vampyre the offer the solemn asseveration illustration admiral bell had  of course  nothing particular to communicate to flora in the walk he induced her to take with him in the gardens of bannerworth hall  but he could talk to her upon a subject which was sure to be a welcome one  namely  of charles holland and not only could he talk to her of charles  but he was willing to talk of him in the style of enthusiastic commendation which assimilated best with her own feelings  no one but the honest old admiral  who was as violent in his likes and his dislikes as any one could possibly be could just then have conversed with flora bannerworth to her satisfaction of charles holland he expressed no doubts whatever concerning charles s faith  and to his mind  now that he had got that opinion firmly fixed in his mind everybody that held a contrary one he at once denounced as a fool or a rogue never you mind  miss flora  he said  you will find  i dare say  that all will come right eventually  d n me  the only thing that provokes me in the whole business is  that i should have been such an old fool as for a moment to doubt charles you should have known him better  sir i should  my dear  but i was taken by surprise  you see  and that was wrong  too  for a man who has held a responsible command but the circumstances  dear sir  were of a nature to take every one by surprise they were  they were  but now  candidly speaking  and i know i can speak candidly to you  do you really think this varney is the vampyre i do you do  well  then  somebody must tackle him  that s quite clear  we can t put up with his fancies always what can be done ah  that i don t know  but something must be done  you know  he wants this place  heaven only knows why or wherefore he has taken such a fancy to it  but he has done so  that is quite clear  if it had a good sea view  i should not be so much surprised  but there s nothing of the sort  so it s no way at all better than any other shore going stupid sort of house  that you can see nothing but land from oh  if my brother would but make some compromise with him to restore charles to us and take the house  we might yet be happy d n it  then you still think that he has a hand in spiriting away charles who else could do so i ll be hanged if i know  i do feel tolerably sure  and i have good deal of reliance upon your opinion  my dear  i say  i do feel tolerably sure  but  if i was d d sure  now  i d soon have it out of him for my sake  admiral bell  i wish now to extract one promise from you say your say  my dear  and i ll promise you you will not then expose yourself to the danger of any personal conflict with that most dreadful man  whose powers of mischief we do not know  and therefore cannot well meet or appreciate whew  is that what you mean yes  you will  i am sure  promise me so much why  my dear  you see the case is this  in affairs of fighting  the less ladies interfere the better nay  why so because because  you see  a lady has no reputation for courage to keep up  indeed  it s rather the other way  for we dislike a bold woman as much as we hold in contempt a cowardly man but if you grant to us females that in consequence of our affections we are not courageous  you must likewise grant how much we are doomed to suffer from the dangers of those whom we esteem you would be the last person in the world to esteem a coward certainly  but there is more true courage often in not fighting than in entering into a contest you are right enough there  my dear under ordinary circumstances  i should not oppose your carrying out the dictates of your honour  but now  let me entreat you not to meet this dreadful man  if man he can be called  when you know not how unfair the contest may be unfair yes  may he not have some means of preventing you from injuring him and of overcoming you  which no mortal possesses he may then the supposition of such a case ought to be sufficient ground for at once inducing you to abandon all idea of meeting with him my dear  i ll consider of this matter do so there is another thing  however  which now you will permit me to ask of you as a favour it is granted ere it is spoken very good  now you must not be offended with what i am going to say because  however it may touch that very proper pride which you  and such as you  are always sure to possess  you are fortunately at all times able to call sufficient judgment to your aid to enable you to see what is really offensive and what is not you alarm me by such a preface do i  then here goes at once  your brother henry  poor fellow  has enough to do  has he not  to make all ends meet a flush of excitement came over flora s cheek as the old admiral thus bluntly broached a subject of which she already knew the bitterness to such a spirit as her brother s you are silent  continued the old man  by that i guess i am not wrong in my i supposition  indeed it is hardly a supposition at all  for master charles told me as much  and no doubt he had it from a correct quarter i cannot deny it  sir then don t  it ain t worth denying  my dear  poverty is no crime  but like being born a frenchman  it s a d d misfortune flora could scarcely refuse a smile  as the nationality of the old admiral peeped out even in the midst of his most liberal and best feelings well  he continued  i don t intend that he shall have so much trouble as he has had  the enemies of his king and his country shall free him from his embarrassments the enemies yes  who else you speak in riddles  sir do i  then i ll soon make the riddles plain  when i went to sea i was worth nothing as poor as a ship s cat after the crew had been paid off for a month  well  i began fighting away as hard and fast as i could and the more i fought  and the more hard knocks i gave and took  the more money i got indeed yes  prize after prize we hauled into port  and at last the french vessels wouldn t come out of their harbours what did you do then what did we do then  why what was the most natural thing in the whole world for us to do  we did i cannot guess well  i am surprised at that  try again oh  yes  i can guess now  how could i have been so dull  you went and took them out to be sure we did to be sure we did  my dear  that s how we managed them  and  do you see  at the end of the war i found myself with lots of prize money  all wrung from old england s enemies  and i intend that some of it shall find it s way to your brother s pocket  and you see that will bear out just what i said  that the enemies of his king and his country shall free him from his difficulties don t you see i see your noble generosity  admiral noble fiddlestick  now i have mentioned this matter to you  my dear and i don t so much mind talking to you about such matters as i should to your brother  i want you to do me the favour of managing it all for me how  sir why  just this way  you must find out how much money will free your brother just now from a parcel of botherations that beset him  and then i will give it to you  and you can hand it to him  you see  so i need not say anything about it  and if he speaks to me on the subject at all i can put him down at once by saying  avast there  it s no business of mine and can you  dear admiral  imagine that i could conceal the generous source from where so much assistance came of course  it will come from you  i take a fancy to make you a present of a sum of money  you do with it what you please it s yours  and i have no right and no inclination to ask you what use you put it to tears gushed from the eyes of flora as she tried to utter some word  but could not  the admiral swore rather fearfully  and pretended to wonder much what on earth she could be crying for  at length  after the first gush of feeling was over  she said i cannot accept of so much generosity  sir i dare not dare not no  i should think meanly of myself were i to take advantage of the boundless munificence of your nature take advantage  i should like to see anybody take advantage of me that s all i ought not to take the money of you  i will speak to my brother  and well i know how much he will appreciate the noble  generous offer  my dear sir well  settle it your own way  only remember i have a right to do what i like with my own money undoubtedly very good  then as that is undoubted  whatever i lend to him  mind i give to you  so it s as broad as it s long  as the dutchman said  when he looked at the new ship that was built for him  and you may as well take it yourself you see  and make no more fuss about it i will consider  said flora  with much emotion between this time and the same hour to morrow i will consider  sir  and if you can find any words more expressive of heartfelt gratitude than others  pray imagine that i have used them with reference to my own feelings towards you for such an unexampled offer of friendship oh  bother stuff the admiral now at once changed the subject  and began to talk of charles a most grateful theme to flora  as may well be supposed  he related to her many little particulars connected with him which all tended to place his character in a most amiable light  and as her ears drank in the words of commendation of him she loved  what sweeter music could there be to her than the voice of that old weather beaten rough spoken man the idea  he added  to a warm eulogium he had uttered concerning charles the idea that he could write those letters my dear  is quite absurd it is  indeed  oh  that we could know what had become of him we shall know  i don t think but what he s alive  something seems to assure me that we shall some of these days look upon his face again i am rejoiced to hear you say so we will stir heaven and earth to find him  if he were killed  do you see  there would have been some traces of him now at hand  besides  he would have been left lying where the rascals attacked him flora shuddered but don t you fret yourself  you may depend that the sweet little cherub that sits up aloft has looked after him i will hope so and now  my dear  master henry will soon be home  i am thinking  and as he has quite enough disagreeables on his own mind to be able to spare a few of them  you will take the earliest opportunity  i am sure  of acquainting him with the little matter we have been talking about  and let me know what he says i will i will that s right  now  go in doors  for there s a cold air blowing here and you are a delicate plant rather just now go in and make yourself comfortable and easy  the worst storm must blow over at last chapter xxxi sir francis varney and his mysterious visitor the strange conference sir francis varney is in what he calls his own apartment  it is night and a dim and uncertain light from a candle which has been long neglected  only serves to render obscurity more perplexing  the room is a costly one  one replete with all the appliances of refinement and luxury which the spirit and the genius of the age could possibly supply him with  but there is upon his brow the marks of corroding care  and little does that most mysterious being seem to care for all the rich furnishing of that apartment in which he sits his cadaverous looking face is even paler and more death like looking than usual  and  if it can be conceived possible that such an one can feel largely interested in human affairs  to look at him  we could well suppose that some interest of no common magnitude was at stake occasionally  too  he muttered some unconnected words  no doubt mentally filling up the gaps  which rendered the sentences incomplete  and being unconscious  perhaps  that he was giving audible utterance to any of his dark and secret meditations at length he rose  and with an anxious expression of countenance  he went to the window  and looked out into the darkness of the night  all was still  and not an object was visible  it was that pitchy darkness without  which  for some hours  when the moon is late in lending her reflected beams  comes over the earth s surface it is near the hour  he muttered  it is now very near the hour surely he will come  and yet i know not why i should fear him  although i seem to tremble at the thought of his approach  he will surely come once a year only once does he visit me  and then tis but to take the price which he has compelled me to pay for that existence  which but for him had been long since terminated  sometimes i devoutly wish it were with a shudder he returned to the seat he had so recently left  and there for some time he appeared to meditate in silence suddenly now  a clock  which was in the hall of that mansion he had purchased  sounded the hour loudly the time has come  said sir francis  the time has come  he will surely soon be here  hark  hark slowly and distinctly he counted the strokes of the clock  and  when they had ceased  he exclaimed  with sudden surprise eleven  but eleven  how have i been deceived  i thought the hour of midnight was at hand he hastily consulted the watch he wore  and then he indeed found  that whatever he had been looking forward to with dread for some time past as certain to ensue  at or about twelve o clock  had yet another hour in which to prey upon his imagination how could i have made so grievous an error  he exclaimed  another hour of suspense and wonder as to whether that man be among the living or the dead  i have thought of raising my hand against his life  but some strange mysterious feeling has always staid me  and i have let him come and go freely  while an opportunity might well have served me to put such a design into execution  he is old  too very old  and yet he keeps death at a distance  he looked pale  but far from unwell or failing  when last i saw him  alas  a whole hour yet to wait  i would that this interview were over that extremely well known and popular disease called the fidgets  now began  indeed  to torment sir francis varney  he could not sit he could not walk  and  somehow or another  he never once seemed to imagine that from the wine cup he should experience any relief  although  upon a side table  there stood refreshments of that character  and thus some more time passed away  and he strove to cheat it of its weariness by thinking of a variety of subjects  but as the fates would have it  there seemed not one agreeable reminiscence in the mind of that most inexplicable man  and the more he plunged into the recesses of memory the more uneasy  not to say almost terrified  he looked and became  a shuddering nervousness came across him  and  for a few moments  he sat as if he were upon the point of fainting  by a vigorous effort  however  he shook this off  and then placing before him the watch  which now indicated about the quarter past eleven  he strove with a calmer aspect to wait the coming of him whose presence  when he did come  would really be a great terror  since the very thought beforehand produced so much hesitation and apparent dismay in order too  if possible  then to further withdraw himself from a too painful consideration of those terrors  which in due time the reader will be acquainted with the cause of  he took up a book  and plunging at random into its contents  he amused his mind for a time with the following brief narrative the wind howled round the gable ends of bridport house in sudden and furious gusts  while the inmates sat by the fire side  gazing in silence upon the blazing embers of the huge fire that shed a red and bright light all over the immense apartment in which they all sat it was an ancient looking place  very large  end capable of containing a number of guests  several were present an aged couple were seated in tall high straight backed chairs  they were the owners of that lordly mansion  and near them sat two young maidens of surpassing beauty  they were dissimilar  and yet there was a slight likeness  but of totally different complexions the one had tresses of raven black  eyebrows  eyelashes  and eyes were all of the same hue  she was a beautiful and proud looking girl  her complexion clear  with the hue of health upon her cheeks  while a smile played around her lips  the glance of the eye was sufficient to thrill through the whole soul the other maiden was altogether different  her complexion altogether fairer her hair of sunny chestnut  and her beautiful hazel eyes were shaded by long brown eyelashes  while a playful smile also lit up her countenance  she was the younger of the two the attention of the two young maidens had been directed to the words of the aged owner of the house  for he had been speaking a few moments before there were several other persons present  and at some little distance were many of the domestics who were not denied the privilege of warmth and rest in the presence of their master these were not the times  when  if servants sat down  they were deemed idle  but the daily task done  then the evening hour was spent by the fire side the wind howls and moans  said an aged domestic  in an awful manner i never heard the like it seems as though some imprisoned spirit was waiting for the repose that had been denied on earth  said the old lady as she shifted her seat and gazed steadily on the fire ay  said her aged companion  it is a windy night  and there will be a storm before long  or i m mistaken it was just such a night as that my son henry left his home  said mrs bradley  just such another only it had the addition of sleet and rain the old man sighed at the mention of his son s name  a tear stood in the eyes of the maidens  while one looked silently at the other  and seemed to exchange glances i would that i might again see him before my body seeks its final home in the cold remorseless grave mother  said the fairest of the two maidens  do not talk thus  let us hope that we yet may have many years of happiness together many  emma yes  mamma  many do you know that i am very old  emma  very old indeed  considering what i have suffered  such a life of sorrow and ill health is at least equal to thirty years added to my life you may have deceived yourself  aunt  said the other maiden  at all events  you cannot count upon life as certain  for the strongest often go first  while those who seem much more likely to fall  by care  as often live in peace and happiness but i lead no life of peace and happiness  while henry bradley is not here  besides  my life might be passed without me seeing him again it is now two years since he was here last  said the old man this night two years was the night on which he left this night two years yes it was this night two years  said one of the servant men  because old dame poutlet had twins on that night a memorable circumstance and one died at a twelvemonth old  said the man  and she had a dream which foretold the event ay  ay yes  and moreover she s had the same dream again last wednesday was a week  said the man and lost the other twin yes sir  this morning omens multiply  said the aged man  i would that it would seem to indicate the return of henry to his home i wonder where he can have gone to  or what he could have done all this time  probably he may not be in the land of the living poor henry  said emma alas  poor boy  we may never see him again it was a mistaken act of his  and yet he knew not otherwise how to act or escape his father s displeasure say no more say no more upon that subject  i dare not listen to it god knows i know quite enough  said mr  bradley  i knew not he would have taken my words so to heart as he did why  said the old woman  he thought you meant what you said there was a long pause  during which all gazed at the blazing fire seemingly wrapt in their own meditation henry bradley  the son of the apparently aged couple  had left that day two years  and wherefore had he left the home of his childhood wherefore had he  the heir to large estates  done this he had dared to love without his father s leave  and had refused the offer his father made him of marrying a young lady whom he had chosen for him  but whom he could not love it was as much a matter of surprise to the father that the son should refuse  as it was to the son that his father should contemplate such a match henry  said the father  you have been thought of by me  i have made proposals for marrying you to the daughter of our neighbour  sir arthur onslow indeed  father yes  i wish you to go there with me to see the young lady in the character of a suitor yes  replied the father  certainly  it s high time you were settled indeed  i would rather not go  father  i have no intention of marrying just yet  i do not desire to do so this was an opposition that mr  bradley had not expected from his son and which his imperious temper could ill brook  and with a darkened brow he said it is not much  henry  that i trespass upon your obedience  but when i do so  i expect that you will obey me but  father  this matter affects me for my whole life that is why i have deliberated so long and carefully over it but it is not unreasonable that i should have a voice in the affair father  since it may render me miserable you shall have a voice then i say no to the whole regulation  said henry  decisively if you do so you forfeit my protection  much more favour  but you had better consider over what you have said  forget it  and come with me i cannot you will not no  father  i cannot do as you wish me  my mind is fully made up upon that matter illustration and so is mine  you either do as i would have you  or you leave the house  and seek your own living  and you are a beggar i should prefer being such  said henry  than to marry any young lady and be unable to love her that is not required no  i am astonished  not necessary to love the woman you marry not at all  if you act justly towards her she ought to be grateful  and it is all that is requisite in the marriage state  gratitude will beget love  and love in one begets love in the other i will not argue with you  father  upon the matter  you are a better judge than i  you have had more experience i have and it would be useless to speak upon the subject  but of this i can speak my own resolve that i will not marry the lady in question the son had all the stern resolve of the father  but he had also very good reasons for what he did  he loved  and was beloved in return  and hence he would not break his faith with her whom he loved to have explained this to his father would have been to gain nothing except an accession of anger  and he would have made a new demand upon his the son s  obedience  by ordering him to discard from his bosom the image that was there indelibly engraven you will not marry her whom i have chosen for your bride i cannot do not talk to me of can and can t  when i speak of will and wont  it is useless to disguise the fact  you have your free will in the matter i shall take no answer but yes or no then  no  father good  sir  and now we are strangers with that mr  bradley turned abruptly from his son  and left him to himself it was the first time they had any words of difference together  and it was sudden and soon terminated henry bradley was indignant at what had happened  he did not think his father would have acted as he had done in this instance  but he was too much interested in the fate of another to hesitate for a moment  then came the consideration as to what he should do  now that he had arrived at such a climax his first thoughts turned to his mother and sister  he could not leave the house without bidding them good bye  he determined to see his mother  for his father had left the hall upon a visit mrs  bradley and emma were alone when he entered their apartment  and to them he related all that had passed between himself and father they besought him to stay  to remain there  or at least in the neighbourhood  but he was resolved to quit the place altogether for a time  as he could do nothing there  and he might chance to do something elsewhere upon this  they got together all the money and such jewels as they could spare  which in all amounted to a considerable sum  then taking an affectionate leave of his mother and sister  henry left the hall not before he had taken a long and affectionate farewell of one other who lived within those walls this was no other than the raven eyed maiden who sat by the fire side and listened attentively to the conversation that was going on  she was his love she  a poor cousin  for her sake he had braved all his father s anger  and attempted to seek his fortune abroad this done  he quietly left the hall  without giving any one any intimation of where he was going old mr  bradley  when he had said so much to his son  was highly incensed at what he deemed his obstinacy  and he thought the threat hanging over him would have had a good effect  but he was amazed when he discovered that henry had indeed left the hall  and he knew not whither for some time he comforted himself with the assurance that he would  he must return  but  alas  he came not  and this was the second anniversary of that melancholy day  which no one more repented of and grieved for than did poor mr  bradley surely  surely he will return  or let us know where he is  he said he cannot be in need  else he would have written to us for aid no  no  said mrs  bradley  it is  i fear  because he has not written that he is in want  he would never write if he was in poverty  lest he should cause us unhappiness at his fate  were he doing well  we should hear of it  for he would be proud of the result of his own unaided exertions well  well  said mr  bradley  i can say no more  if i was hasty  so was he  but it is passed  i would forgive all the past  if i could but see him once again once again how the wind howls  added the aged man  and it s getting worse and worse yes  and the snow is coming down now in style  said one of the servants  who brought in some fresh logs which were piled up on the fire  and he shook the white flakes off his clothes it will be a heavy fall before morning  said one of the men yes  it has been gathering for some days  it will be much warmer than it has been when it is all down so it will so it will at that moment there was a knocking at the gate  and the dogs burst into a dreadful uproar from their kennels go  robert  said mr  bradley  and see who it is that knocks such a night as this  it is not fit or safe that a dog should be out in it the man went out  and shortly returned  saying so please you  sir  there is a traveller that has missed his way  and desires to know if he can obtain shelter here  or if any one can be found to guide him to the nearest inn bid him come in  we shall lose no warmth because there is one more before the fire the stranger entered  and said i have missed my way  and the snow comes down so thick and fast  and is whirled in such eddies  that i fear  by myself  i should fall into some drift  and perish before morning do not speak of it  sir  said mr  bradley  such a night as this is a sufficient apology for the request you make  and an inducement to me to grant it most willingly thanks  replied the stranger  the welcome is most seasonable be seated  sir  take your seat by the ingle  it is warm the stranger seated himself  and seemed lost in reflection  as he gazed intently on the blazing logs  he was a robust man  with great whiskers and beard  and  to judge from his outward habiliments  he was a stout man have you travelled far i have  sir you appear to belong to the army  if i mistake not i do  sir there was a pause  the stranger seemed not inclined to speak of himself much  but mr  bradley continued have you come from foreign service  sir  i presume you have yes  i have not been in this country more than six days indeed  shall we have peace think you i do so  and i hope it may be so  for the sake of many who desire to return to their native land  and to those they love best mr  bradley heaved a deep sigh  which was echoed softly by all present and the stranger looked from one to another  with a hasty glance  and then turned his gaze upon the fire may i ask  sir  if you have any person whom you regard in the army any relative alas  i have perhaps  i ought to say i had a son  i know not  however where he is gone oh  a runaway  i see oh  no  he left because there were some family differences  and now  i would  that he were once more here oh  said the stranger  softly  differences and mistakes will happen now and then  when least desired at this moment  an old hound who had lain beside ellen mowbray  she who wore the coal black tresses  lifted his head at the difference in sound that was noticed in the stranger s voice  he got up and slowly walked up to him  and began to smell around him  and  in another moment  he rushed at him with a cry of joy  and began to lick and caress him in the most extravagant manner  this was followed by a cry of joy in all present it is henry  exclaimed ellen mowbray  rising and rushing into his arms it was henry  and he threw off the several coats he had on  as well as the large beard he wore to disguise himself the meeting was a happy one  there was not a more joyful house than that within many miles around  henry was restored to the arms of those who loved him  and  in a month  a wedding was celebrated between him and his cousin ellen                                    sir francis varney glanced at his watch  it indicated but five minutes to twelve o clock  and he sprang to his feet  even as he did so  a loud knocking at the principal entrance to his house awakened every echo within its walls chapter xxxii the thousand pounds the stranger s precautions illustration varney moved not now  nor did he speak  but  like a statue  he stood with his unearthly looking eyes rivetted upon the door of the apartment in a few moments one of his servants came  and said sir  a person is here  who says he wants to see you  he desired me to say  that he had ridden far  and that moments were precious when the tide of life was ebbing fast yes  yes  gasped varney  admit him  i know him  bring him here  it is an old friend of mine he sank into a chair  and still he kept his eyes fixed upon that door through which his visitor must come  surely some secret of dreadful moment must be connected with him whom sir francis expected dreaded and yet dared not refuse to see  and now a footstep approaches a slow and a solemn footstep it pauses a moment at the door of the apartment  and then the servant flings it open  and a tall man enters  he is enveloped in the folds of a horseman s cloak  and there is the clank of spurs upon his heels as he walks into the room varney rose again  but he said not a word and for a few moments they stood opposite each other in silence  the domestic has left the room and the door is closed  so that there was nothing to prevent them from conversing  and  yet  silent they continued for some minutes  it seemed as if each was most anxious that the other should commence the conversation  first and yet there was nothing so very remarkable in the appearance of that stranger which should entirely justify sir francis varney  in feeling so much alarm at his presence  he certainly was a man past the prime of life  and he looked like one who had battled much with misfortune  and as if time had not passed so lightly over his brow  but that it had left deep traces of its progress  the only thing positively bad about his countenance  was to be found in his eyes  there there was a most ungracious and sinister expression  a kind of lurking and suspicions look  as if he were always resolving in his mind some deep laid scheme which might be sufficient to circumvent the whole of mankind finding  probably  that varney would not speak first  he let his cloak fall more loosely about him  and in a low  deep tone  he said i presume i was expected you were  said varney  it is the day  and it is the hour you are right  i like to see you so mindful  you don t improve in looks since hush hush  no more of that  can we not meet without a dreadful allusion to the past  there needs nothing to remind me of it  and your presence here now shows that you are not forgetful  speak not of that fearful episode  let no words combine to place it in a tangible shape to human understanding  i cannot  dare not  hear you speak of that it is well  said the stranger  as you please  let our interview be brief  you know my errand i do  so fearful a drag upon limited means  is not likely to be readily forgotten oh  you are too ingenious too full of well laid schemes  and to apt and ready in their execution  to feel  as any fearful drag  the conditions of our bargain  why do you look at me so earnestly because  said varney and he trembled as he spoke because each lineament of your countenance brings me back to the recollection of the only scene in life that made me shudder  and which i cannot think of even with the indifference of contempt  i see it all before my mind s eye  coming in frightful panoramic array  those incidents  which even to dream of  are sufficient to drive the soul to madness  the dread of this annual visit  hangs upon me like a dark cloud upon my very heart  it sits like some foul incubus  destroying its vitality and dragging me from day to day  nearer to that tomb  from whence not as before  i can emerge you have been among the dead  said the stranger i have and yet are mortal yes  repeated varney  yes  and yet am mortal it was i that plucked you back to that world  which  to judge from your appearance  has had since that eventful period but few charms for you by my faith you look like like what i am  interrupted varney this is a subject that once a year gets frightfully renewed between us for weeks before your visit i am haunted by frightful recollections  and it takes me many weeks after you are gone  before i can restore myself to serenity  look at me  am i not an altered man in faith you are  said the stranger i have no wish to press upon you painful recollections  and yet tis strange to me that upon such a man as you  the event to which you allude should produce so terrible an impression i have passed through the agony of death  said varney  and have again endured the torture for it is such of the re union of the body and the soul  not having endured so much  not the faintest echo of such feelings can enter into your imagination there may be truth in that  and yet  like a fluttering moth round a flame  it seems to me  that when i do see you  you take a terrific kind of satisfaction in talking of the past that is strictly true  said varney  the images with which my mind is filled are frightful  pent up do they remain for twelve long months  i can speak to you  and you only  without disguise  and thus does it seem to me that i get rid of the uneasy load of horrible imaginings  when you are gone  and have been gone a sufficient lapse of time  my slumbers are not haunted with frightful images i regain a comparative peace  until the time slowly comes around again  when we are doomed to meet i understand you  you seem well lodged here i have ever kept my word  and sent to you  telling you where i am you have  truly  i have no shadow of complaint to make against you  no one  could have more faithfully performed his bond than you have  i give you ample credit for all that  and long may you live still to perform your conditions i dare not deceive you  although to keep such faith i may be compelled to deceive a hundred others of that i cannot judge  fortune seems to smile upon you  you have not as yet disappointed me and will not now  said varney  the gigantic and frightful penalty of disappointing you  stares me in the face  i dare not do so he took from his pocket  as he spoke  a clasped book  from which he produced several bank notes  which he placed before the stranger a thousand pounds  he said  that is the agreement it is to the very letter  i do not return to you a thousand thanks we understand each other better than to waste time with idle compliment indeed i will go quite as far as to say  truthfully  that did not my necessities require this amount from you  you should have the boon  for which you pay that price at a much cheaper rate enough  enough  said varney  it is strange  that your face should have been the last i saw  when the world closed upon me  and the first that met my eyes when i was again snatched back to life  do you pursue still your dreadful trade yes  said the stranger  for another year  and then  with such a moderate competence as fortune has assigned me  i retire  to make way for younger and abler spirits and then  said varney  shall you still require of me such an amount as this no  this is my last visit but one  i shall be just and liberal towards you  you are not old  and i have no wish to become the clog of your existence  as i have before told you  it is my necessity  and not my inclination  that sets the value upon the service i rendered you i understand you  and ought to thank you  and in reply to so much courtesy  be assured  that when i shudder at your presence  it is not that i regard you with horror  as an individual  but it is because the sight of you awakens mournfully the remembrance of the past it is clear to me  said the stranger  and now i think we part with each other in a better spirit than we ever did before  and when we meet again  the remembrance that it is the last time  will clear away the gloom that i now find hanging over you it may  it may  with what an earnest gaze you still regard me i do  it does appear to me most strange  that time should not have obliterated the effects which i thought would have ceased with their cause  you are no more the man that in my recollection you once were than i am like a sporting child and i never shall be  said varney  never never again  this self same look which the hand of death had placed upon me  i shall ever wear  i shudder at myself  and as i oft perceive the eye of idle curiosity fixed steadfastly upon me  i wonder in my inmost heart  if even the wildest guesser hits upon the cause why i am not like unto other men no  of that you may depend there is no suspicion  but i will leave you now  we part such friends  as men situated as we are can be  once again shall we meet  and then farewell for ever do you leave england  then i do  you know my situation in life  it is not one which offers me inducements to remain  in some other land  i shall win the respect and attention i may not hope for here  there my wealth will win many golden opinions  and casting  as best i may  the veil of forgetfulness over my former life  my declining years may yet be happy  this money  that i have had of you from time to time  has been more pleasantly earned than all beside  wrung  as it has been  from your fears  still have i taken it with less reproach  and now  farewell varney rang for a servant to show the stranger from the house  and without another word they parted then  when he was alone  that mysterious owner of that costly home drew a long breath of apparently exquisite relief that is over that is over  he said  he shall have the other thousand pounds  perchance  sooner than he thinks  with all expedition i will send it to him  and then on that subject i shall be at peace  i shall have paid a large sum  but that which i purchased was to me priceless  it was my life it was my life itself  that possession which the world s wealth cannot restore  and shall i grudge these thousands which have found their way into this man s hands  no  tis true  that existence  for me  has lost some of its most resplendent charms  tis true  that i have no earthly affections  and that shunning companionship with all  i am alike shunned by all  and yet  while the life blood still will circulate within my shrunken veins  i cling to vitality he passed into an inner room  and taking from a hook  on which it hung a long  dark coloured cloak  he enveloped his tall  unearthly figure within its folds then  with his hat in his hand  he passed out of his house  and appeared to be taking his way towards bannerworth house surely it must be guilt of no common die that could oppress a man so destitute of human sympathies as sir francis varney  the dreadful suspicions that hovered round him with respect to what he was  appeared to gather confirmation from every act of his existence whether or not this man  to whom he felt bound to pay annually so large a sum  was in the secret  and knew him to be something more than earthly  we cannot at present declare  but it would seem from the tenor of their conversation as if such were the fact perchance he had saved him from the corruption of the tomb  by placing out  on some sylvan spot  where the cold moonbeams fell  the apparently lifeless form  and now claimed so large a reward for such a service  and the necessary secrecy contingent upon it we say this may be so  and yet again some more natural and rational explanation may unexpectedly present itself  and there may be yet a dark page in sir francis varney s life s volume  which will place him in a light of superadded terrors to our readers time  and the now rapidly accumulating incidents of our tale  will soon tear aside the veil of mystery that now envelopes some of our dramatis personae and let us hope that in the development of those incidents we shall be enabled to rescue the beautiful flora bannerworth from the despairing gloom that is around her  let us hope and even anticipate that we shall see her smile again  that the roseate hue of health will again revisit her cheeks  the light buoyancy of her step return  and that as before she may be the joy of all around her  dispensing and receiving happiness and  he too  that gallant fearless lover  he whom no chance of time or tide could sever from the object of his fond affections  he who listened to nothing but the dictates of his heart s best feelings  let us indulge a hope that he will have a bright reward  and that the sunshine of a permanent felicity will only seem the brighter for the shadows that for a time have obscured its glory chapter xxxiii the strange interview the chase through the hall illustration it was with the most melancholy aspect that anything human could well bear  that sir francis varney took his lonely walk  although perhaps in saying so much  probably we are instituting a comparison which circumstances scarcely empower us to do  for who shall say that that singular man  around whom a very atmosphere of mystery seemed to be perpetually increasing  was human averse as we are to believe in the supernatural  or even to invest humanity with any preternatural powers  the more than singular facts and circumstances surrounding the existence and the acts of that man bring to the mind a kind of shuddering conviction  that if he be indeed really mortal he still must possess some powers beyond ordinary mortality  and be walking the earth for some unhallowed purposes  such as ordinary men with the ordinary attributes of human nature can scarcely guess at silently and alone he took his way through that beautiful tract of country  comprehending such picturesque charms of hill and dale which lay between his home and bannerworth hall  he was evidently intent upon reaching the latter place by the shortest possible route  and in the darkness of that night  for the moon had not yet risen  he showed no slight acquaintance with the intricacies of that locality  that he was at all enabled to pursue so undeviatingly a tract as that which he took he muttered frequently to himself low  indistinct words as he went  and chiefly did they seem to have reference to that strange interview he had so recently had with one who  from some combination of circumstances scarcely to be guessed at  evidently exercised a powerful control over him  and was enabled to make a demand upon his pecuniary resources of rather startling magnitude and yet  from a stray word or two  which were pronounced more distinctly  he did not seem to be thinking in anger over that interview but it would appear that it rather had recalled to his remembrance circumstances of a painful and a degrading nature  which time had not been able entirely to obliterate from his recollection yes  yes  he said  as he paused upon the margin of the wood  to the confines of which he  or what seemed to be he  had once been chased by marchdale and the bannerworths yes  the very sight of that man recalls all the frightful pageantry of a horrible tragedy  which i can never never forget  never can it escape my memory  as a horrible  a terrific fact  but it is the sight of this man alone that can recall all its fearful minutiae to my mind  and paint to my imagination  in the most vivid colours  every  the least particular connected with that time of agony  these periodical visits much affect me  for months i dread them  and for months i am but slowly recovering from the shocks they give me  but once more  he says but once more  and then we shall not meet again  well  well  perchance before that time arrives  i may be able to possess myself of those resources which will enable me to forestall his visit  and so at least free myself from the pang of expecting him he paused at the margin of the wood  and glanced in the direction of bannerworth hall  by the dim light which yet showed from out the light sky  he could discern the ancient gable ends  and turret like windows he could see the well laid out gardens  and the grove of stately firs that shaded it from the northern blasts  and  as he gazed  a strong emotion seemed to come over him  such as no one could have supposed would for one moment have possessed the frame of one so apparently unconnected with all human sympathies i know this spot well  he said  and my appearance here on that eventful occasion  when the dread of my approach induced a crime only second to murder itself  was on such a night as this  when all was so still and calm around  and when he who  at the merest shadow of my presence  rather chose to rush on death than be assured it was myself curses on the circumstances that so foiled me  i should have been most wealthy  i should have possessed the means of commanding the adulation of those who now hold me but cheaply  but still the time may come  i have a hope yet  and that greatness which i have ever panted for  that magician like power over my kind  which the possession of ample means alone can give  may yet be mine wrapping his cloak more closely around him  he strode forward with that long  noiseless step which was peculiar to him  mechanically he appeared to avoid those obstacles of hedge and ditch which impeded his pathway surely he had come that road often  or he would not so easily have pursued his way  and now he stood by the edge of a plantation which in some measure protected from trespassers the more private gardens of the hall  and there he paused  as if a feeling of irresolution had come over him  or it might be  as indeed it seemed from his subsequent conduct that he had come without any fixed intention  or if with a fixed intention  without any regular plan of carrying it into effect did he again dream of intruding into any of the chambers of that mansion  with the ghastly aspect of that terrible creation with which in the minds of its inhabitants  he seemed to be but too closely identified  he was pale  attenuated  and trembled  could it be that so soon it had become necessary to renew the life blood in his veins in the awful manner which it is supposed the vampyre brood are compelled to protract their miserable existence it might be so  and that he was even now reflecting upon how once more he could kindle the fire of madness in the brain of that beautiful girl who he had already made so irretrievably wretched he leant against an aged tree  and his strange  lustrous looking eyes seemed to collect every wandering scintillation of light that was around  and to shine with preternatural intensity i must  i will  he said  be master of bannerworth hall  it must come to that  i have set an existence upon its possession  and i will have it  and then  if with my own hands i displace it brick by brick and stone by stone  i will discover that hidden secret which no one but myself now dreams of  it shall be done by force or fraud  by love or by despair  i care not which  the end shall sanctify all means  ay  even if i wade through blood to my desire  i say it shall be done there was a holy and a still calmness about the night much at variance with the storm of angry passion that appeared to be momentarily gathering power in the breast of that fearful man  not the least sound came from bannerworth hall  and it was only occasionally that from afar off on the night air there came the bark of some watchdog  or the low of distant cattle  all else was mute save when the deep sepulchral tones of that man  if man he was  gave an impulse to the soft air around him with a strolling movement as if he were careless if he proceeded in that direction or not  he still went onward toward the house  and now he stood by that little summer house once so sweet and so dear a retreat in which the heart stricken flora had held her interview with him whom she loved with a devotion unknown to meaner minds this spot scarcely commanded any view of the house  for so enclosed was it among evergreens and blooming flowers  that it seemed like a very wilderness of nature  upon which  with liberal hand  she had showered down in wild luxuriance her wildest floral beauties in and around that spot the night air was loaded with sweets  the mingled perfume of many flowers made that place seem a very paradise but oh  how sadly at variance with that beauty and contentedness of nature was he who stood amidst such beauty  all incapable as he was of appreciating its tenderness  or of gathering the faintest moral from its glory why am i here  he said  here  without fixed design or stability of purpose  like some miser who has hidden his own hoards so deeply within the bowels of the earth he cannot hope that he shall ever again be able to bring them to the light of day  i hover around this spot which i feel which i know contains my treasure  though i cannot lay my hands upon it  or exult in its glistening beauty even as he spoke he cowered down like some guilty thing  for he heard a faint footstep upon the garden path  so light  so fragile was the step that  in the light of day  the very hum of summer insects would have drowned the noise  but he heard it  that man of crime of unholy and awful impulses  he heard it  and he shrunk down among the shrubs and flowers till he was hidden completely from observation amid a world of fragrant essences was it some one stealthily in that place even as he was  unwelcome or unknown  or was it one who had observed him intrude upon the privacy of those now unhappy precincts  and who was coming to deal upon him that death which  vampyre though he might be  he was yet susceptible of from mortal hands the footstep advanced  and lower down he shrunk until his coward heart beat against the very earth itself  he knew that he was unarmed  a circumstance rare with him  and only to be accounted for by the disturbance of his mind consequent upon the visit of that strange man to his house  whose presence had awakened so many conflicting emotions nearer and nearer still came that light footstep  and his deep seated fears would not let him perceive that it was not the step of caution or of treachery  but owed its lightness to the natural grace and freedom of movement of its owner the moon must have arisen  although obscured by clouds  through which it cast but a dim radiance  for the night had certainly grown lighter  so that although there were no strong shadows cast  a more diffused brightness was about all things  and their outlines looked not so dancing  and confused the one with the other he strained his eyes in the direction whence the sounds proceeded  and then his fears for his personal safety vanished  for he saw it was a female form that was slowly advancing towards him his first impulse was to rise  for with the transient glimpse he got of it  he knew that it must be flora bannerworth  but a second thought probably one of intense curiosity to know what could possibly have brought her to such a spot at such a time  restrained him  and he was quiet  but if the surprise of sir francis varney was great to see flora bannerworth at such a time in such a place  we have no doubt  that with the knowledge which our readers have of her  their astonishment would more than fully equal his  and when we come to consider  that since that eventful period when the sanctity of her chamber had been so violated by that fearful midnight visitant  it must appear somewhat strange that she could gather courage sufficient to wander forth alone at such an hour had she no dread of meeting that unearthly being  did the possibility that she might fall into his ruthless grasp  not come across her mind with a shuddering consciousness of its probability  had she no reflection that each step she took  was taking her further and further from those who would aid her in all extremities  it would seem not  for she walked onward  unheeding  and apparently unthinking of the presence possible or probable  of that bane of her existence but let us look at her again  how strange and spectral like she moves along  there seems no speculation in her countenance  but with a strange and gliding step  she walks like some dim shadow of the past in that ancient garden  she is very pale  and on her brow there is the stamp of suffering  her dress is a morning robe  she holds it lightly round her and thus she moves forward towards that summer house which probably to her was sanctified by having witnessed those vows of pure affection which came from the lips of charles holland  about whose fate there now hung so great a mystery has madness really seized upon the brain of that beautiful girl  has the strong intellect really sunk beneath the oppressions to which it has been subjected  does she now walk forth with a disordered intellect  the queen of some fantastic realm  viewing the material world with eyes that are not of earth  shunning perhaps that which she should have sought and  perchance  in her frenzy  seeking that which in a happier frame of mind she would have shunned illustration such might have been the impression of any one who had looked upon her for a moment  and who knew the disastrous scenes through which she had so recently passed  but we can spare our readers the pangs of such a supposition  we have bespoken their love for flora bannerworth  and we are certain that she has it  therefore would we spare them  even for a few brief moments  from imagining that cruel destiny had done its worst and that the fine and beautiful spirit we have so much commended had lost its power of rational reflection  no  thank heaven  such is not the case  flora bannerworth is not mad  but under the strong influence of some eccentric dream  which has pictured to her mind images which have no home but in the airy realms of imagination  she has wandered forth from her chamber to that sacred spot where she had met him she loved and heard the noblest declaration of truth and constancy that ever flowed from human lips yes  she is sleeping  but  with a precision such as the somnambulist so strangely exerts  she trod the well known paths slowly  but surely toward that summer s bower  where her dreams had not told her lay crouching that most hideous spectre of her imagination  sir francis varney  he who stood between her and her heart s best joy  he who had destroyed all hope of happiness  and who had converted her dearest affections into only so many causes of greater disquietude than the blessings they should have been to her oh  could she have imagined but for one moment that he was there  with what an eagerness of terror would she have flown back again to the shelter of those walls  where at least was to be found some protection from the fearful vampyre s embrace  and where she would be within hail of friendly hearts  who would stand boldly between her and every thought of harm but she knew it not  and onwards she went until the very hem of her garment touched the face of sir francis varney and he was terrified he dared not move he dared not speak  the idea that she had died  and that this was her spirit  come to wreak some terrible vengeance upon him  for a time possessed him  and so paralysed with fear was he  that he could neither move nor speak it had been well if  during that trance of indecision in which his coward heart placed him  flora had left the place  and again sought her home  but unhappily such an impulse came not over her  she sat upon that rustic seat  where she had reposed when charles had clasped her to his heart  and through her very dream the remembrance of that pure affection came across her  and in the tenderest and most melodious accents  she said charles  charles  and do you love me still  no no  you have not forsaken me  save me  save me from the vampyre she shuddered  and sir francis varney heard her weeping fool that i am  he muttered  to be so terrified  she sleeps  this is one of the phases which a disordered imagination oft puts on  she sleeps  and perchance this may be an opportunity of further increasing the dread of my visitation  which shall make bannerworth hall far too terrible a dwelling place for her  and well i know  if she goes  they will all go  it will become a deserted house  and that is what i want  a house  too  with such an evil reputation  that none but myself  who have created that reputation  will venture within its walls a house  which superstition will point out as the abode of evil spirits a house  as it were  by general opinion  ceded to the vampyre  yes  it shall be my own  fit dwelling place for a while for me  i have sworn it shall be mine  and i will keep my oath  little such as i have to do with vows he rose  and moved slowly to the narrow entrance of the summer house  a movement he could make  without at all disturbing flora  for the rustic seat  on which she sat  was at its further extremity  and there he stood  the upper part of his gaunt and hideous form clearly defined upon the now much lighter sky  so that if flora bannerworth had not been in that trance of sleep in which she really was  one glance upward would let her see the hideous companion she had  in that once much loved spot a spot hitherto sacred to the best and noblest feelings  but now doomed for ever to be associated with that terrific spectre of despair but she was in no state to see so terrible a sight  her hands were over her face  and she was weeping still surely  he loves me  she whispered  he has said he loved me  and he does not speak in vain  he loves me still  and i shall again look upon his face  a heaven to me  charles  charles  you will come again  surely they sin against the divinity of love  who would tell me that you love me not ha  muttered varney  this passion is her first  and takes a strong hold on her young heart she loves him but what are human affections to me  i have no right to count myself in the great muster roll of humanity  i look not like an inhabitant of the earth  and yet am on it i love no one  expect no love from any one  but i will make humanity a slave to me  and the lip service of them who hate me in their hearts shall be as pleasant jingling music to my ear  as if it were quite sincere  i will speak to this girl  she is not mad perchance she may be there was a diabolical look of concentrated hatred upon varney s face as he now advanced two paces towards the beautiful flora chapter xxxiv the threat its consequences the rescue  and sir francis varney s danger illustration sir francis varney now paused again  and he seemed for a few moments to gloat over the helpless condition of her whom he had so determined to make his victim  there was no look of pity in his face  no one touch of human kindness could be found in the whole expression of those diabolical features  and if he delayed making the attempt to strike terror into the heart of that unhappy  but beautiful being  it could not be from any relenting feeling  but simply  that he wished for a few moments to indulge his imagination with the idea of perfecting his villany more effectually alas  and they who would have flown to her rescue they  who for her would have chanced all accidents  ay  even life itself  were sleeping and knew not of the loved one s danger  she was alone  and far enough from the house  to be driven to that tottering verge where sanity ends and the dream of madness  with all its terrors  commences but still she slept if that half waking sleep could indeed be considered as any thing akin to ordinary slumber still she slept  and called mournfully upon her lover s name  and in tender  beseeching accents  that should have melted even the stubbornest hearts  did she express her soul s conviction that he loved her still the very repetition of the name of charles holland seemed to be galling to sir francis varney  he made a gesture of impatience  as she again uttered it  and then  stepping forward  he stood within a pace of where she sat  and in a fearfully distinct voice he said flora bannerworth  awake  awake  and look upon me  although the sight blast and drive you to despair  awake  awake it was not the sound of the voice which aroused her from that strange slumber  it is said that those who sleep in that eccentric manner  are insensible to sounds  but that the lightest touch will arouse them in an instant  and so it was in this case  for sir francis varney  as he spoke  laid upon the hand of flora two of his cold  corpse like looking fingers  a shriek burst from her lips  and although the confusion of her memory and conceptions was immense  yet she was awake  and the somnambulistic trance had left her help  help  she cried  gracious heavens  where am i varney spoke not  but he spread out his long  thin arms in such a manner that he seemed almost to encircle her  while he touched her not  so that escape became a matter of impossibility  and to attempt to do so  must have been to have thrown herself into his hideous embrace she could obtain but a single view of the face and figure of him who opposed her progress  but  slight as that view was  it more than sufficed  the very extremity of fear came across her  and she sat like one paralysed  the only evidence of existence she gave consisting in the words the vampyre the vampyre yes  said varney  the vampyre  you know me  flora bannerworth varney  the vampyre  your midnight guest at that feast of blood  i am the vampyre  look upon me well  shrink not from my gaze  you will do well not to shun me  but to speak to me in such a shape that i may learn to love you flora shook as in a convulsion  and she looked as white as any marble statue this is horrible  she said  why does not heaven grant me the death i pray for hold  said varney  dress not up in the false colours of the imagination that which in itself is sufficiently terrific to need none of the allurements of romance  flora bannerworth  you are persecuted persecuted by me  the vampyre  it is my fate to persecute you  for there are laws to the invisible as well as the visible creation that force even such a being as i am to play my part in the great drama of existence  i am a vampyre  the sustenance that supports this frame must be drawn from the life blood of others oh  horror horror but most i do affect the young and beautiful  it is from the veins of such as thou art  flora bannerworth  that i would seek the sustenance i m compelled to obtain for my own exhausted energies  but never yet  in all my long career a career extending over centuries of time never yet have i felt the soft sensation of human pity till i looked on thee exquisite piece of excellence  even at the moment when the reviving fluid from the gushing fountain of your veins was warming at my heart  i pitied and i loved you  oh  flora  even i can now feel the pang of being what i am there was a something in the tone  a touch of sadness in the manner  and a deep sincerity in these words  that in some measure disabused flora of her fears  she sobbed hysterically  and a gush of tears came to her relief  as  in almost inarticulate accents  she said may the great god forgive even you i have need of such a prayer  exclaimed varney heaven knows i have need of such a prayer  may it ascend on the wings of the night air to the throne of heaven  may it be softly whispered by ministering angels to the ear of divinity  god knows i have need of such a prayer to hear you speak in such a strain  said flora  calms the excited fancy  and strips even your horrible presence of some of its maddening influence hush  said the vampire  you must hear more you must know more ere you speak of the matters that have of late exercised an influence of terror over you but how came i here  said flora  tell me that  by what more than earthly power have you brought me to this spot  if i am to listen to you  why should it not be at some more likely time and place i have powers  said varney  assuming from flora s words  that she would believe such arrogance i have powers which suffice to bend many purposes to my will powers incidental to my position  and therefore is it i have brought you here to listen to that which should make you happier than you are i will attend  said flora  i do not shudder now  there s an icy coldness through my veins  but it is the night air speak  i will attend you i will  flora bannerworth  i am one who has witnessed time s mutations on man and on his works  and i have pitied neither  i have seen the fall of empires  and sighed not that high reaching ambition was toppled to the dust  i have seen the grave close over the young and the beautiful those whom i have doomed by my insatiable thirst for human blood to death  long ere the usual span of life was past  but i never loved till now can such a being as you  said flora be susceptible of such an earthly passion and wherefore not love is either too much of heaven  or too much of earth to find a home with thee no  flora  no  it may be that the feeling is born of pity  i will save you i will save you from a continuance of the horrors that are assailing you oh  then may heaven have mercy in your hour of need amen may you even yet know peace and joy above it is a faint and straggling hope but if achieved  it will be through the interposition of such a spirit as thine  flora  which has already exercised so benign an influence upon my tortured soul  as to produce the wish within my heart  to do a least one unselfish action that wish  said flora  shall be father to the deed  heaven has boundless mercy yet for thy sweet sake  i will believe so much  flora bannerworth  it is a condition with my hateful race  that if we can find one human heart to love us  we are free  if  in the face of heaven  you will consent to be mine  you will snatch me from a continuance of my frightful doom  and for your pure sake  and on your merits  shall i yet know heavenly happiness  will you be mine a cloud swept from off the face of the moon  and a slant ray fell upon the hideous features of the vampire  he looked as if just rescued from some charnel house  and endowed for a space with vitality to destroy all beauty and harmony in nature  and drive some benighted soul to madness no  no  no  shrieked flora  never enough  said varney  i am answered  it was a bad proposal  i am a vampyre still spare me  spare me blood flora sank upon her knees  and uplifted her hands to heaven  mercy mercy  she said blood  said varney  and she saw his hideous  fang like teeth  blood flora bannerworth  the vampyre s motto  i have asked you to love me  and you will not the penalty be yours no  no  said flora  can it be possible that even you  who have already spoken with judgment and precision  can be so unjust  you must feel that  in all respects  i have been a victim  most gratuitously a sufferer  while there existed no just cause that i should suffer  one who has been tortured  not from personal fault  selfishness  lapse of integrity  or honourable feelings  but because you have found it necessary  for the prolongation of your terrific existence  to attack me as you have done  by what plea of honour  honesty  or justice  can i be blamed for not embracing an alternative which is beyond all human control i cannot love you then be content to suffer  flora bannerworth  will you not  even for a time  to save yourself and to save me  become mine horrible proposition then am i doomed yet  perhaps  for many a cycle of years  to spread misery and desolation around me  and yet i love you with a feeling which has in it more of gratefulness and unselfishness than ever yet found a home within my breast  i would fain have you  although you cannot save me  there may yet be a chance  which shall enable you to escape from the persecution of my presence oh  glorious chance  said flora  which way can it come  tell me how i may embrace it  and such grateful feelings as a heart stricken mourner can offer to him who has rescued her from her deep affliction  shall yet be yours hear me  then  flora bannerworth  while i state to you some particulars of mysterious existence  of such beings as myself  which never yet have been breathed to mortal ears flora looked intently at him  and listened  while  with a serious earnestness of manner  he detailed to her something of the physiology of the singular class of beings which the concurrence of all circumstances tended to make him appear flora  he said  it is not that i am so enamoured of an existence to be prolonged only by such frightful means  which induces me to become a terror to you or to others  believe me  that if my victims  those whom my insatiable thirst for blood make wretched  suffer much  i  the vampyre  am not without my moments of unutterable agony  but it is a mysterious law of our nature  that as the period approaches when the exhausted energies of life require a new support from the warm  gushing fountain of another s veins  the strong desire to live grows upon us until  in a paroxysm of wild insanity  which will recognise no obstacles  human or divine  we seek a victim a fearful state  said flora it is so  and  when the dreadful repast is over  then again the pulse beats healthfully  and the wasted energies of a strange kind of vitality are restored to us  we become calm again  but with that calmness comes all the horror  all the agony of reflection  and we suffer far more than tongue can tell you have my pity  said flora  even you have my pity i might well demand it  if such a feeling held a place within your breast  i might well demand your pity  flora bannerworth  for never crawled an abject wretch upon the earth s rotundity  so pitiable as i go on  go on i will  and with such brief conclusions as i may  having once attacked any human being  we feel a strange  but terribly impulsive desire again to seek that person for more blood  but i love you  flora  the small amount of sensibility that still lingers about my preternatural existence  acknowledges in you a pure and better spirit  i would fain save you oh  tell me how i may escape the terrible infliction that can only be done by flight  leave this place  i implore you  leave it as quickly as the movement may be made  linger not cast not one regretful look behind you on your ancient home  i shall remain in this locality for years  let me lose sight of you  i will not pursue you but  by force of circumstances  i am myself compelled to linger here flight is the only means by which you may avoid a doom as terrific as that which i endure but tell me  said flora  after a moment s pause  during which she appeared to be endeavouring to gather courage to ask some fearful question  tell me if it be true that those who have once endured the terrific attack of a vampyre  become themselves  after death  one of that dread race it is by such means  said varney  that the frightful brood increases but time and circumstances must aid the development of the new and horrible existence  you  however  are safe safe  oh  say that word again yes  safe  not once or twice will the vampyre s attack have sufficient influence on your mortal frame  as to induce a susceptibility on your part to become coexistent with such as he  the attacks must be often repeated  and the termination of mortal existence must be a consequence essential  and direct from those attacks  before such a result may be anticipated yes  yes  i understand if you were to continue my victim from year to year  the energies of life would slowly waste away  and  till like some faint taper s gleam consuming more sustenance than it received  the veriest accident would extinguish your existence  and then  flora bannerworth  you might become a vampyre oh  horrible  most horrible if by chance  or by design  the least glimpse of the cold moonbeams rested on your apparently lifeless remains  you would rise again and be one of us a terror to yourself and a desolation to all around oh  i will fly from here  said flora  the hope of escape from so terrific and dreadful a doom shall urge me onward  if flight can save me flight from bannerworth hall  i will pause not until continents and oceans divide us it is well  i m able now thus calmly to reason with you  a few short months more and i shall feel the languor of death creeping over me  and then will come that mad excitement of the brain  which  were you hidden behind triple doors of steel  would tempt me again to seek your chamber again to seize you in my full embrace again to draw from your veins the means of prolonged life again to convulse your very soul with terror i need no incentives  said flora  with a shudder  in the shape of descriptions of the past  to urge me on you will fly from bannerworth hall yes  yes  said flora  it shall be so  its very chambers now are hideous with the recollection of scenes enacted in them  i will urge my brothers  my mother  all to leave  and in some distant clime we will find security and shelter  there even we will learn to think of you with more of sorrow than of anger more pity than reproach more curiosity than loathing be it so  said the vampyre  and he clasped his hands  as if with a thankfulness that he had done so much towards restoring peace at least to one  who  in consequence of his acts  had felt such exquisite despair  be it so  and even i will hope that the feelings which have induced so desolated and so isolated a being as myself to endeavour to bring peace to one human heart  will plead for me  trumpet tongued  to heaven it will it will  said flora do you think so i do  and i will pray that the thought may turn to certainty in such a cause the vampyre appeared to be much affected  and then he added flora  you know that this spot has been the scene of a catastrophe fearful to look back upon  in the annals of your family it has  said flora  i know to what you allude  tis a matter of common knowledge to all a sad theme to me  and one i would not court nor would i oppress you with it  your father  here  on this very spot committed that desperate act which brought him uncalled for to the judgment seat of god  i have a strange  wild curiosity upon such subjects  will you  in return for the good that i have tried to do you gratify it i know not what you mean  said flora to be more explicit  then  do you remember the day on which your father breathed his last too well too well did you see him or converse with him shortly before that desperate act was committed no  he shut himself up for some time in a solitary chamber ha  what chamber the one in which i slept myself on the night yes  yes  the one with the portrait that speaking portrait the eyes of which seem to challenge an intruder as he enters the apartment the same for hours shut up there  added varney  musingly  and from thence he wandered to the garden  where  in this summer house  he breathed his last it was so then  flora  ere i bid you adieu these words were scarcely uttered  when there was a quick  hasty footstep  and henry bannerworth appeared behind varney  in the very entrance of the summer house now  he cried  for revenge  now  foul being  blot upon the earth s surface  horrible imitation of humanity  if mortal arm can do aught against you  you shall die a shriek came from the lips of flora  and flinging herself past varney who stepped aside  she clung to her brother  who made an unavailing pass with his sword at the vampyre  it was a critical moment  and had the presence of mind of varney deserted him in the least  unarmed as he was he must have fallen beneath the weapon of henry  to spring  however  up the seat which flora had vacated  and to dash out some of the flimsy and rotten wood work at the back of the summer house by the propulsive power of his whole frame  was the work of a moment  and before henry could free himself from the clinging embrace of flora  varney  the vampyre was gone  and there was no greater chance of his capture than on a former occasion  when he was pursued in vain from the hall to the wood  in the intricacies of which he was so entirely lost chapter xxxv the explanation marchdale s advice the projected removal  and the admiral s anger illustration this extremely sudden movement on the part of varney was certainly as unexpected as it was decisive  henry had imagined  that by taking possession of the only entrance to the summer house  he must come into personal conflict with the being who had worked so much evil for him and his  and that he should so suddenly have created for himself another mode of exit  certainly never occurred to him for heaven s sake  flora  he said  unhand me  this is a time for action but  henry  henry  hear me presently  presently  dear flora  i will yet make another effort to arrest the headlong flight of varney he shook her off  perhaps with not more roughness than was necessary to induce her to forego her grasp of him  but in a manner that fully showed he intended to be free  and then he sprang through the same aperture whence varney had disappeared  just as george and mr  marchdale arrived at the door of the summer house it was nearly morning  so that the fields were brightening up with the faint radiance of the coming day  and when henry reached a point which he knew commanded an extensive view  he paused  and ran his eye eagerly along the landscape  with a hope of discovering some trace of the fugitive such  however  was not the case  he saw nothing  heard nothing of sir francis varney  and then he turned  and called loudly to george to join him  and was immediately replied to by his brother s presence accompanied by marchdale before  however  they could exchange a word  a rattling discharge of fire arms took place from one of the windows  and they heard the admiral  in a loud voice  shouting broadside to broadside  give it them again  jack  hit them between wind and water then there was another rattling discharge  and henry exclaimed what is the meaning of that firing it comes from the admiral s room  said marchdale  on my life  i think the old man must be mad  he has some six or eight pistols ranged in a row along the window sill  and all loaded  so that by the aid of a match they can be pretty well discharged as a volley  which he considers the only proper means of firing upon the vampyre it is so  replied george  and  no doubt  hearing an alarm  he has commenced operations by firing into the enemy well  well  said henry  he must have his way  i have pursued varney thus far  and that he has again retreated to the wood  i cannot doubt between this and the full light of day  let us at least make an effort to discover his place of retreat  we know the locality as well as he can possibly  and i propose now that we commence an active search come on  then  said marchdale  we are all armed  and i  for one shall feel no hesitation in taking the life  if it be possible to do so of that strange being of that possibility you doubt  said george  as they hurried on across the meadows indeed i do  and with reason too  i m certain that when i fired at him before i hit him  and besides  flora must have shot him upon the occasion when we were absent  and she used your pistols henry  to defend herself and her mother it would seem so  said henry  and disregarding all present circumstances  if i do meet him  i will put to the proof whether he be mortal or not the distance was not great  and they soon reached the margin of the wood  they then separated agreeing to meet within it  at a well spring familiar to them all  previous to which each was to make his best endeavour to discover if any one was hidden among the bush wood or in the hollows of the ancient trees they should encounter on their line of march the fact was  that henry finding that he was likely to pass an exceedingly disturbed  restless night  through agitation of spirits had  after tossing to and fro on his couch for many hours  wisely at length risen  and determined to walk abroad in the gardens belonging to the mansion  in preference to continuing in such a state of fever and anxiety  as he was in  in his own chamber since the vampyre s dreadful visit  it had been the custom of both the brothers  occasionally  to tap at the chamber door of flora  who  at her own request  now that she had changed her room  and dispensed with any one sitting up with her  wished occasionally to be communicated with by some member of the family henry  then  after rapidly dressing  as he passed the door of her bedroom  was about to tap at it  when to his surprise he found it open and upon hastily entering it he observed that the bed was empty  and a hasty glance round the apartment convinced him that flora was not there alarm took possession of him  and hastily arming himself  he roused marchdale and george  but without waiting for them to be ready to accompany him  he sought the garden  to search it thoroughly in case she should be anywhere there concealed thus it was he had come upon the conference so strangely and so unexpectedly held between varney and flora in the summer house  with what occurred upon that discovery the readers are acquainted flora had promised george that she would return immediately to the house  but when  in compliance with the call of henry  george and marchdale had left her alone  she felt so agitated and faint that she began to cling to the trellis work of the little building for a few moments before she could gather strength to reach the mansion two or three minutes might thus have elapsed  and flora was in such a state of mental bewilderment with all that had occurred  that she could scarce believe it real  when suddenly a slight sound attracted her attention  and through the gap which had been made in the wall of the summer house  with an appearance of perfect composure  again appeared sir francis varney flora  he said  quietly resuming the discourse which had been broken off  i am quite convinced now that you will be much the happier for the interview gracious heaven  said flora  whence have you come from i have never left  said varney but i saw you fly from this spot you did  but it was only to another immediately outside the summer house  i had no idea of breaking off our conference so abruptly have you anything to add to what you have already stated absolutely nothing  unless you have a question to propose to me i should have thought you had  flora  is there no other circumstance weighing heavily upon your mind  as well as the dreadful visitation i have subjected you to yes  said flora  what has become of charles holland listen  do not discard all hope  when you are far from here you will meet with him again but he has left me and yet he will be able  when you again encounter him  so far to extenuate his seeming perfidy  that you shall hold him as untouched in honour as when first he whispered to you that he loved you oh  joy  joy  said flora  by that assurance you have robbed misfortune of its sting  and richly compensated me for all that i have suffered adieu  said the vampyre  i shall now proceed to my own home by a different route to that taken by those who would kill me but after this  said flora  there shall be no danger  you shall be held harmless  and our departure from bannerworth hall shall be so quick  that you will soon be released from all apprehension of vengeance from my brother  and i shall taste again of that happiness which i thought had fled from me for ever farewell  said the vampire  and folding his cloak closely around him he strode from the summer house  soon disappearing from her sight behind the shrubs and ample vegetation with which that garden abounded flora sunk upon her knees  and uttered a brief  but heartfelt thanksgiving to heaven for this happy change in her destiny  the hue of health faintly again visited her cheeks  and as she now  with a feeling of more energy and strength than she had been capable of exerting for many days  walked towards the house  she felt all that delightful sensation which the mind experiences when it is shaking off the trammels of some serious evil which it delights now to find that the imagination has attired in far worse colours than the facts deserved it is scarcely necessary  after this  to say that the search in the wood for sir francis varney was an unproductive one  and that the morning dawned upon the labours of the brother and of mr  marchdale  without their having discovered the least indication of the presence of varney again puzzled and confounded  they stood on the margin of the wood  and looked sadly towards the brightening windows of bannerworth hall  which were now reflecting with a golden radiance the slant rays of the morning sun foiled again  remarked henry  with a gesture of impatience  foiled again  and as completely as before  i declare that i will fight this man  let our friend the admiral say what he will against such a measure i will meet him in mortal combat  he shall consummate his triumph over our whole family by my death  or i will rid the world and ourselves of so frightful a character let us hope  said marchdale  that some other course may be adopted which shall put an end to these proceedings that  exclaimed henry  is to hope against all probability  what other course can be pursued  be this varney man or devil  he has evidently marked us for his prey illustration indeed  it would seem so  remarked george  but yet he shall find that we will not fall so easily  he shall discover that if poor flora s gentle spirit has been crushed by these frightful circumstances  we are of a sterner mould he shall  said henry  i for one will dedicate my life to this matter i will know no more rest than is necessary to recruit my frame  until i have succeeded in overcoming this monster  i will seek no pleasure here and will banish from my mind  all else that may interfere with that one fixed pursuit  he or i must fall well spoken  said marchdale  and yet i hope that circumstances may occur to prevent such a necessity of action  and that probably you will yet see that it will be wise and prudent to adopt a milder and a safer course no  marchdale  you cannot feel as we feel  you look on more as a spectator  sympathising with the afflictions of either  than feeling the full sting of those afflictions yourself do i not feel acutely for you  i m a lonely man in the world  and i have taught myself now to centre my affections in your family  my recollections of early years assist me in so doing  believe me  both of you  that i am no idle spectator of your griefs  but that i share them fully  if i advise you to be peaceful  and to endeavour by the gentlest means possible to accomplish your aims  it is not that i would counsel you cowardice  but having seen so much more of the world than either of you have had time or opportunity of seeing  i do not look so enthusiastically upon matters  but  with a cooler  calmer judgment  i do not say a better  i proffer to you my counsel we thank you  said henry  but this is a matter in which action seems specially called for  it is not to be borne that a whole family is to be oppressed by such a fiend in human shape as that varney let me  said marchdale  counsel you to submit to flora s decision in this business  let her wishes constitute the rules of action  she is the greatest sufferer  and the one most deeply interested in the termination of this fearful business  moreover she has judgment and decision of character she will advise you rightly  be assured that she would advise us honourably  said henry  and that we should feel every disposition in the world to defer to her wishes our proposition  is not to be doubted  but little shall be done without her counsel and sanction  let us now proceed homeward  for i am most anxious to ascertain how it came about that she and sir francis varney were together in that summer house at so strange an hour they all three walked together towards the house  conversing in a similar strain as they went chapter xxxvi the consultation the duel and its results illustration independent of this interview which flora had had with the much dreaded sir francis varney  the circumstances in which she and all who were dear to her  happened at that moment to be placed  certainly required an amount of consideration  which could not be too soon bestowed by a combination of disagreeables  everything that could possibly occur to disturb the peace of the family seemed to have taken place at once like macbeth s  their troubles had truly come in battalions  and now that the serenity of their domestic position was destroyed  minor evils and annoyances which that very serenity had enabled them to hold at arm s length became gigantic  and added much to their distress the small income  which  when all was happiness  health and peace  was made to constitute a comfortable household  was now totally inadequate to do so the power to economise and to make the most of a little  had flown along with that contentedness of spirit which the harmony of circumstances alone could produce it was not to be supposed that poor mrs  bannerworth could now  as she had formerly done  when her mind was free from anxiety  attend to those domestic matters which make up the comforts of a family distracted at the situation of her daughter  and bewildered by the rapid succession of troublesome events which so short a period of time had given birth to she fell into an inert state of mind as different as anything could possibly be  from her former active existence it has likewise been seen how the very domestics fled from bannerworth hall in dismay  rather than remain beneath the same roof with a family believed to be subject to the visitations of so awful a being as a vampyre among the class who occupy positions of servitude  certainly there might have been found some  who  with feelings and understandings above such considerations  would have clung sympathetically to that family in distress  which they had known under a happier aspect  but it had not been the good fortune of the bannerworths to have such as these about them  hence selfishness had its way  and they were deserted  it was not likely  then  that strangers would willingly accept service in a family so situated  without some powerful impulse in the shape of a higher pecuniary consideration  as was completely out of the power of the bannerworths to offer thus was it  then  that most cruelly  at the very time that they had most need of assistance and of sympathy  this unfortunate family almost became isolated from their kind  and  apart from every other consideration  it would have been almost impossible for them to continue inhabitants of the hall  with anything like comfort  or advantage and then  although the disappearance of charles holland no longer awakened those feelings of indignation at his supposed perfidy which were first produced by that event  still  view it in which way they might  it was a severe blow of fate  and after it  they one and all found themselves still less able to contend against the sea of troubles that surrounded them the reader  too  will not have failed to remark that there was about the whole of the family that pride of independence which induced them to shrink from living upon extraneous aid  and hence  although they felt and felt truly  that when admiral bell  in his frank manner  offered them pecuniary assistance  that it was no idle compliment  yet with a sensitiveness such as they might well be expected to feel  they held back  and asked each other what prospect there was of emerging from such a state of things  and if it were justifiable to commence a life of dependence  the end of which was not evident or tangible notwithstanding  too  the noble confidence of flora in her lover  and notwithstanding that confidence had been echoed by her brothers  there would at times obtrude into the minds of the latter  a feeling of the possibility  that after all they might be mistaken  and charles holland might  from some sudden impulse  fancying his future happiness was all at stake  have withdrawn himself from the hall  and really written the letters attributed to him we say this only obtruded itself occasionally  for all their real feelings and aspirations were the other way  although mr  marchdale they could perceive  had his doubts  and they could not but confess that he was more likely to view the matter calmly and dispassionately than they in fact  the very hesitation with which he spoke upon the subject convinced them of his doubt  for they attributed that hesitation to a fear of giving them pain  or of wounding the prejudices of admiral bell with whom he had already had words so nearly approaching to a quarrel henry s visit to mr  chillingworth was not likely to be productive of any results beyond those of a conjectural character  all that that gentleman could do was to express a willingness to be directed by them in any way  rather than suggest any course of conduct himself upon circumstances which he could not be expected to judge of as they who were on the spot  and had witnessed their actual occurrence and now we will suppose that the reader is enabled with us to look into one of the principal rooms of bannerworth hall  it is evening  and some candles are shedding a sickly light on the ample proportions of the once handsome apartment  at solemn consultation the whole of the family are assembled  as well as the admiral  mr  chillingworth  and marchdale jack pringle  too  walked in  by the sufferance of his master  as if he considered he had a perfect right to do so the occasion of the meeting had been a communication which flora had made concerning her most singular and deeply interesting interview with the vampyre  the details of this interview had produced a deep effect upon the whole of the family  flora was there  and she looked better calmer  and more collected than she had done for some days past no doubt the interview she had had with varney in the summer house in the garden had dispelled a host of imaginary terrors with which she had surrounded him  although it had confirmed her fully that he and he only was the dreadful being who had caused her so much misery that interview had tended to show her that about him there was yet something human  and that there was not a danger of her being hunted down from place to place by so horrible an existence such a feeling as this was  of course  a source of deep consolation  and with a firmer voice  and more of her old spirit of cheerfulness about her than she had lately exhibited  she again detailed the particulars of the interview to all who had assembled  concluding by saying and this has given me hope of happier days  if it be a delusion  it is a happy one  and now that but a frightful veil of mystery still hangs over the fate of charles holland  i how gladly would i bid adieu to this place  and all that has made it terrible  i could almost pity sir francis varney  rather than condemn him that may be true  said henry  to a certain extent  sister  but we never can forget the amount of misery he has brought upon us  it is no slight thing to be forced from our old and much loved home  even if such proceeding does succeed in freeing us from his persecutions but  my young friend  said marchdale  you must recollect  that through life it is continually the lot of humanity to be endeavouring to fly from great evils to those which do not present themselves to the mind in so bad an aspect  it is something  surely  to alleviate affliction  if we cannot entirely remove it that is true  said mr  chillingworth  to a considerable extent  but then it takes too much for granted to please me how so  sir why  certainly  to remove from bannerworth hall is a much less evil than to remain at bannerworth hall  and be haunted by a vampyre  but then that proposition takes for granted that vampyre business  which i will never grant  i repeat  again and again  it is contrary to all experience  to philosophy  and to all the laws of ordinary nature facts are stubborn things  said marchdale apparently  remarked mr  chillingworth well  sir  and here we have the fact of a vampyre the presumed fact  one swallow don t make a summer  mr  marchdale this is waste of time  said henry of course  the amount of evidence that will suffice to bring conviction to one man s mind will fail in doing so to another  the question is  what are we to do all eyes were turned upon flora  as if this question was more particularly addressed to her  and it behoved her  above all others  to answer it  she did so  and in a firm  clear voice  she said i will discover the fate of charles holland  and then leave the hall the fate of charles holland  said marchdale  why  really  unless that young gentleman chooses to be communicative himself upon so interesting a subject  we may be a long while discovering his fate  i know that it is not a romantic view to take of the question  to suppose simply that he wrote the three letters found upon his dressing table  and then decamped  but to my mind  it savours most wonderfully of matter of fact i now speak more freely than i have otherwise done  for i am now upon the eve of my departure  i have no wish to remain here  and breed dissension in any family  or to run a tilt against anybody s prejudices  here he looked at admiral bell  i leave this house to night you re a d d lubberly thief  said the admiral  the sooner you leave it the better  why  you bad looking son of a gun  what do you mean  i thought we d had enough of that i fully expected this abuse  said marchdale did you expect that  said the admiral  as he snatched up an inkstand and threw at marchdale  hitting him a hard knock on the chin  and bespattering its contents on his breast  now i ll give you satisfaction  you lubber  d me  if you ain t a second jones  and enough to sink the ship  shiver my timbers if i sha n t say something strong presently i really  said henry  must protest  admiral bell  against this conduct protest and be d d mr  marchdale may be right  sir  or he may be wrong  it s a matter of opinion oh  never mind  said marchdale  i look upon this old nautical ruffian as something between a fool and a madman  if he were a younger man i should chastise him upon the spot  but as it is i live in hopes yet of getting him into some comfortable lunatic asylum me into an asylum  shouted the admiral  jack  did you hear that ay  ay  sir farewell all of you  said marchdale  my best wishes be with this family  i cannot remain under this roof to be so insulted a good riddance  cried the admiral  i d rather sail round the world with a shipload of vampyres than with such a humbugging son of a gun as you are  d e  you re worse than a lawyer nay  nay  cried they  mr  marchdale  stay stay  stay  cried george  and mrs  bannerworth  likewise  said stay but at the moment flora stepped forward  and in a clear voice she said no  let him go  he doubts charles holland  let all go who doubt charles holland  mr  marchdale  heaven forgive you this injustice you are doing we may never meet again  farewell  sir these words were spoken in so decided a tone  that no one contradicted them  marchdale cast a strange kind of look round upon the family circle  and in another instant he was gone huzza  shouted jack pringle  that s one good job henry looked rather resentful  which the admiral could not but observe and so  less with the devil may care manner in which he usually spoke the old man addressed him hark ye  mr  henry bannerworth  you ain t best pleased with me  and in that case i don t know that i shall stay to trouble you any longer  as for your friend who has left you  sooner or later you ll find him out i tell you there s no good in that fellow  do you think i ve been cruizing about for a matter of sixty years  and don t know an honest man when i see him  but never mind  i m going on a voyage of discovery for my nephew  and you can do as you like heaven only knows  admiral bell  said henry  who is right and who is wrong  i do much regret that you have quarrelled with mr  marchdale  but what is done can t be undone do not leave us  said flora  let me beg of you  admiral bell  not to leave us  for my sake remain here  for to you i can speak freely and with confidence  of charles  when probably i can do so to no one else you knew him well and have a confidence in him  which no one else can aspire to  i pray you  therefore  to stay with us only on one condition  said the admiral name it name it you think of letting the hall yes  yes let me have it  then  and let me pay a few years in advance  if you don t  i m d d if i stay another night in the place  you must give me immediate possession  too  and stay here as my guests until you suit yourselves elsewhere  those are my terms and conditions  say yes  and all s right  say no  and i m off like a round shot from a carronade d me  that s the thing  jack  isn t it ay  ay  sir there was a silence of some few moments after this extraordinary offer had been made  and then they spoke  saying admiral bell  your generous offer  and the feelings which dictated it are by far too transparent for us to affect not to understand them  your actions  admiral oh  bother my actions  what are they to you  come  now  i consider myself master of the house  d n you  i invite you all to dinner  or supper  or to whatever meal comes next  mrs  bannerworth  will you oblige me  as i m an old fool in family affairs  by buying what s wanted for me and my guests  there s the money  ma am  come along  jack  we ll take a look over our new house  what do you think of it wants some sheathing  sir  here and there very like  but  however  it will do well enough for us  we re in port you know  come along ay  ay  sir and off went the admiral and jack  after leaving a twenty pound note in mrs  bannerworth s lap chapter xxxvii sir francis varney s separate opponents the interposition of flora illustration the old admiral so completely overcame the family of the bannerworths by his generosity and evident single mindedness of his behaviour  that although not one  except flora  approved of his conduct towards mr marchdale  yet they could not help liking him  and had they been placed in a position to choose which of the two they would have had remain with them  the admiral or marchdale  there can be no question they would have made choice of the former still  however  it was not pleasant to find a man like marchdale virtually driven from the house  because he presumed to differ in opinion upon a very doubtful matter with another of its inmates  but as it was the nature of the bannerworth family always to incline to the most generous view of subjects  the frank  hearty confidence of the old admiral in charles holland pleased them better than the calm and serious doubting of marchdale his ruse of hiring the house of them  and paying the rent in advance for the purpose of placing ample funds in their hands for any contingency  was not the less amiable because it was so easily seen through  and they could not make up their minds to hurt the feelings of the old man by the rejection of his generous offer when he had left  this subject was canvassed among them  and it was agreed that he should have his own way in the matter for the present although they hoped to hear something from marchdale  which should make his departure appear less abrupt and uncomfortable to the whole of the family during the course of this conversation  it was made known to flora with more distinctness than under any other circumstances it would have been that george holland had been on the eve of fighting a duel with sir francis varney  previous to his mysterious disappearance when she became fully aware of this fact  to her mind it seemed materially to add to the suspicions previously to then entertained  that foul means had been used in order to put charles out of the way who knows  she said  that this varney may not shrink with the greatest terror from a conflict with any human being  and feeling one was inevitable with charles holland  unless interrupted by some vigorous act of his own  he or some myrmidons of his may have taken charles s life i do not think  flora  said henry  that he would have ventured upon so desperate an act  i cannot well believe such a thing possible  but fear not  he will find  if he have really committed any such atrocity that it will not save him these words of henry  though it made no impression at the time upon flora  beyond what they carried upon their surface  they really however  as concerned henry himself  implied a settled resolution  which he immediately set about reducing to practice when the conference broke up  night  as it still was  he  without saying anything to any one  took his hat and cloak  and left the hall proceeding by the nearest practicable route to the residence of sir francis varney  where he arrived without any interruption of any character varney was at first denied to him  but before he could leave the house a servant came down the great staircase  to say it was a mistake  and that sir francis was at home  and would be happy to see him he was ushered into the same apartment where sir francis varney had before received his visitors  and there sat the now declared vampyre looking pale and ghastly by the dim light which burned in the apartment and  indeed  more like some spectre of the tomb  than one of the great family of man be seated  sir  said varney  although my eyes have seldom the pleasure of beholding you within these walls  be assured you are a honoured guest sir francis varney  said henry  i came not here to bandy compliments with you  i have none to pay to you  nor do i wish to hear any of them from your lips an excellent sentiment  young man  said varney  and well delivered may i presume  then  without infringing too far upon your extreme courtesy  to inquire  to what circumstances i am indebted for your visit to one  sir francis  that i believe you are better acquainted with than you will have the candour to admit indeed  sir  said varney  coldly  you measure my candour  probably by a standard of your own  in which case i fear  i may be no gainer  and yet that may be of itself a circumstance that should afford little food for surprise  but proceed  sir since we have so few compliments to stand between us and our purpose  we shall in all due time arrive at it yes  in due time  sir francis varney  and that due time has arrived know you anything of my friend  mr  charles holland  said henry  in marked accents  and he gazed on sir francis varney with earnestness that seemed to say not even a look should escape his observation varney  however  returned the gaze as steadily  but coldly  as he replied in his measured accents i have heard of the young gentleman and seen him and seen him too  as you  mr  bannerworth  must be well aware  surely you have not come all this way  merely to make such an inquiry  but sir  you are welcome to the answer henry had something of a struggle to keep down the rising anger  at these cool taunts of varney  but he succeeded and then he said i suspect charles holland  sir francis varney  has met with unfair treatment  and that he has been unfairly dealt with  for an unworthy purpose undoubtedly  said varney  if the gentleman you allude to  has been unfairly dealt with  it was for a foul purpose  for no good or generous object  my young sir  could be so obtained you acknowledge so much  i doubt not i do  sir francis varney  and hence the purpose of my visit here for this reason i apply to you a singular object  supported by a singular reason  i cannot see the connection  young sir  pray proceed to enlighten me upon this matter and when you have done that  may i presume upon your consideration  to inquire in what way i can be of any service to you sir francis  said henry  his anger raising his tones this will not serve you i have come to exact an account of how you have disposed of my friend  and i will have it gently  my good sir  you are aware i know nothing of your friend  his motions are his own  and as to what i have done with him  my only answer is  that he would permit me to do nothing with him  had i been so inclined to have taken the liberty you are suspected  sir francis varney  of having made an attempt upon the life or liberty of charles holland  you  in fact  are suspected of being his murderer and  so help me heaven  if i have not justice  i will have vengeance young sir  your words are of grave import  and ought to be coolly considered before they are uttered  with regard to justice and vengeance  mr  bannerworth  you may have both  but i tell you  of charles holland  or what has become of him  i know nothing  but wherefore do you come to so unlikely a quarter to learn something of an individual of whom i know nothing because charles holland was to have fought a duel with you  but before that had time to take place  he has suddenly become missing  i suspect that you are the author of his disappearance  because you fear an encounter with a mortal man mr  bannerworth  permit me to say  in my own defence  that i do not fear any man  however foolish he may be  and wisdom is not an attribute i find  from experience in all men  of your friend  however  you must be dreaming  sir a kind of vivid insanity has taken possession of your mind  which distorts sir francis varney  exclaimed henry  now perfectly uncontrollable sir  said varney  as he filled up the pause  proceed  i am all attention  you do me honour if  resumed henry  such was your object in putting mr  holland aside by becoming personally or by proxy an assassin  you are mistaken in supposing you have accomplished your object go on  sir  said sir francis varney  in a bland and sweet tone  i am all attention  pray proceed you have failed  for i now here  on this spot  defy you to mortal combat  coward  assassin as you are  i challenge you to fight you don t mean on the carpet here  said varney  deliberately no  sir  but beneath the canopy of heaven  in the light of the day  and then  sir francis  we shall see who will shrink from the conflict it is remarkably good  mr  bannerworth  and  begging your pardon  for i do not wish to give any offence  my honoured sir  it would rehearse before an audience  in short  sir  it is highly dramatic you shrink from the combat  do you  now  indeed  i know you young man young man  said sir francis  calmly  and shaking his head very deliberately  and the shadows passed across his pale face  you know me not  if you think sir francis varney shrinks from any man  much less one like yourself you are a coward  and worse  if you refuse my challenge i do not refuse it  i accept it  said varney  calmly  and in a dignified manner  and then  with a sneer  he added you are well acquainted with the mode in which gentlemen generally manage these matters  mr  bannerworth  and perhaps i am somewhat confined in my knowledge in the ways of the world  because you are your own principal and second  in all my experience  i never met with a similar case the circumstances under which it is given are as unexampled  and will excuse the mode of the challenge  said henry  with much warmth singular coincidence the challenge and mode of it is most singular they are well matched in that respect  singular  did i say  the more i think of it  mr  bannerworth  the more i am inclined to think this positively odd early to morrow  sir francis  you shall hear from me in that case  you will not arrange preliminaries now  well  well  it is very unusual for the principals themselves to do so  and yet  excuse my freedom  i presumed  as you had so far deserted the beaten track  that i had no idea how far you might be disposed to lead the same route i have said all i intended to say  sir francis varney  we shall see each other again i may not detain you  i presume  to taste aught in the way of refreshment henry made no reply  but turned towards the door  without even making an attempt to return the grave and formal bow that sir francis varney made as he saw him about to quit the apartment  for henry saw that his pale features were lighted up with a sarcastic smile  most disagreeable to look upon as well as irritating to henry bannerworth he now quitted sir francis varney s abode  being let out by a servant who had been rung for for that purpose by his master henry walked homeward  satisfied that he had now done all that he could under the circumstances i will send chillingworth to him in the morning  and then i shall see what all this will end in  he must meet me  and then charles holland  if not discovered  shall be  at least  revenged there was another person in bannerworth hall who had formed a similar resolution  that person was a very different sort of person to henry bannerworth  though quite as estimable in his way this was no other than the old admiral  it was singular that two such very different persons should deem the same steps necessary  and both keep the secret from each other  but so it was  and  after some internal swearing  he determined upon challenging varney in person i d send jack pringle  but the swab would settle the matter as shortly as if a youngster was making an entry in a log  and heard the boatswain s whistle summoning the hands to a mess  and feared he would lose his grog d n my quarters  but sir francis varney  as he styles himself  sha n t make any way against old admiral bell  he s as tough as a hawser  and just the sort of blade for a vampyre to come athwart  i ll pitch him end long  and make a plank of him afore long  cus my windpipe  what a long  lanky swab he is  with teeth fit to unpick a splice  but let me alone  i ll see if i can t make a hull of his carcass  vampyre or no vampyre my nevy  charles holland  can t be allowed to cut away without nobody s leave or licence  no  no  i ll not stand that anyhow  never desert a messmate in the time of need  is the first maxim of a seaman  and i ain t the one as ll do so thus self communing  the old admiral marched along until he came to sir francis varney s house  at the gate of which he gave the bell what he called a long pull  a strong pull  and a pull altogether  that set it ringing with a fury  the like of which had never certainly been heard by the household a minute or two scarcely elapsed before the domestics hurried to answer so urgent a summons  and when the gate was opened  the servant who answered it inquired his business what s that to you  snob  is your master  sir francis varney  in because  if he be  let him know old admiral bell wants to speak to him d ye hear yes  sir  replied the servant  who had paused a few moments to examine the individual who gave this odd kind of address in another minute word was brought to him that sir francis varney would be very happy to see admiral bell ay  ay  he muttered  just as the devil likes to meet with holy water or as i like any water save salt water he was speedily introduced to sir francis varney  who was seated in the same posture as he had been left by henry bannerworth not many minutes before admiral bell  said sir francis  rising  and bowing to that individual in the most polite  calm  and dignified manner imaginable  permit me to express the honour i feel at this unexpected visit none of your gammon will you be seated  allow me to offer you such refreshments as this poor house affords d n all this  you know  sir francis  i don t want none o  this palaver  it s for all the world like a frenchman  when you are going to give him a broadside  he makes grimaces  throws dust in your eyes  and tries to stab you in the back  oh  no  none of that for me i should say not  admiral bell  i should not like it myself  and i dare say you are a man of too much experience not to perceive when you are or are not imposed upon well  what is that to you  d n me  i didn t come here to talk to you about myself then may i presume upon your courtesy so far as to beg that you will enlighten me upon the object of your visit yes  in pretty quick time  just tell me where you have stowed away my nephew  charles holland really  i hold your slack  will you  and hear me out  if he s living  let him out  and i ll say no more about it  that s liberal  you know  it ain t terms everybody would offer you i must  in truth  admit they are not  and  moreover  they quite surprise even me  and i have learned not to be surprised at almost anything well  will you give him up alive  but  hark ye  you mustn t have made very queer fish of him  do ye see i hear you  said sir francis  with a bland smile  passing one hand gently over the other  and showing his front teeth in a peculiar manner but i really cannot comprehend all this  but i may say  generally  that mr  holland is no acquaintance of mine  and i have no sort of knowledge where he may be that won t do for me  said the admiral  positively  shaking his head i am particularly sorry  admiral bell  that it will not  seeing that i have nothing else to say i see how it is  you ve put him out of the way  and i m d d if you shan t bring him to life  whole and sound  or i ll know the reason why with that i have already furnished you  admiral bell  quietly rejoined varney  anything more on that head is out of my power  though my willingness to oblige a person of such consideration as yourself  is very great  but  permit me to add  this is a very strange and odd communication from one gentleman to another  you have lost a relative who has  very probably  taken some offence  or some notion into his head  of which nobody but himself knows anything  and you come to one yet more unlikely to know anything of him  than even yourself gammon again  now  sir francis varney  or blarney varney  if you please  admiral bell  i was christened varney christened  eh yes  christened were you not christened  if not  i dare say you understand the ceremony well enough illustration i should think i did  but  as for christening  a go on  sir a vampyre  why i should as soon think of reading the burial service of a pig very possible  but what has all this to do with your visit to me this much  you lubber  now  d n my carcass from head to stern  if i don t call you out well  admiral bell  slid varney  mildly  in that case  i suppose i must come out  but why do you insist that i have any knowledge of your nephew  mr  charles holland you were to have fought a duel with him  and now he s gone i am here  said varney ay  said the admiral  that s as plain as a purser s shirt upon a handspike  but that s the very reason why my nevey ain t here  and that s all about it and that s marvellous little  so far as the sense is concerned  said varney  without the movement of a muscle it is said that people of your class don t like fighting mortal men now you have disposed of him  lest he should dispose of you that is explicit  but it is to no purpose  since the gentleman in question hasn t placed himself at my disposal then  d e  i will  fish  flesh  or fowl  i don t care  all s one to admiral bell  come fair or fowl  i m a tar for all men  a seaman ever ready to face a foe  so here goes  you lubberly moon manufactured calf i hear  admiral  but it is scarcely civil  to say the least of it however  as you are somewhat eccentric  and do not  i dare say  mean all your words imply  i am quite willing to make every allowance i don t want any allowance  d n you and your allowance  too  nothing but allowance of grog  and a pretty good allowance  too  will do for me and tell you  sir francis varney  said the admiral  with much wrath that you are a d d lubberly hound  and i ll fight you  yes  i m ready to hammer away  or with anything from a pop gun to a ship s gun you don t come over me with your gammon  i tell you  you ve murdered charles holland because you couldn t face him that s the truth of it with the other part of your speech  admiral bell  allow me to say  you have mixed up a serious accusation one i cannot permit to pass lightly will you or not fight oh  yes  i shall be happy to serve you any way that i can  i hope this will be an answer to your accusation  also that s settled  then why  i am not captious  admiral bell  but it is not generally usual for the principals to settle the preliminaries themselves  doubtless you  in your career of fame and glory  know something of the manner in which gentlemen demean themselves on these occasions oh  d n you  yes  i ll send some one to do all this  yes  yes  jack pringle will be the man  though jack ain t a holiday  shore going smooth spoken swab  but as good a seaman as ever trod deck or handled a boarding pike any friend of yours  said varney  blandly  will be received and treated as such upon an errand of such consequence  and now our conference has  i presume  concluded yes  yes  i ve done d e  no yes no  i will keel haul you but i ll know something of my neavy  charles holland good day  admiral bell  as varney spoke  he placed his hand upon the bell which he had near him  to summon an attendant to conduct the admiral out  the latter  who had said a vast deal more than he ever intended  left the room in a great rage  protesting to himself that he would amply avenge his nephew  charles holland he proceeded homeward  considerably vexed and annoyed that he had been treated with so much calmness  and all knowledge of his nephew denied when he got back  he quarrelled heartily with jack pringle made it up drank grog quarrelled made it up  and finished with grog again until he went to bed swearing he should like to fire a broadside at the whole of the french army  and annihilate it at once with this wish  he fell asleep early next morning  henry bannerworth sought mr  chillingworth  and having found him  he said in a serious tone mr  chillingworth  i have rather a serious favour to ask you  and one which you may hesitate in granting it must be very serious indeed  said mr  chillingworth  that i should hesitate to grant it to you  but pray inform me what it is that you deem so serious sir francis varney and i must have a meeting  said henry have you really determined upon such a course  said mr  chillingworth you know the character of your adversary that is all settled i have given a challenge  and he has accepted it so all other considerations verge themselves into one and that is the when  where  and how i see  said mr  chillingworth  well  since it cannot be helped on your part  i will do what is requisite for you do you wish anything to be done or insisted on in particular in this affair nothing with regard to sir francis varney that i may not leave to your discretion  i feel convinced that he is the assassin of charles holland whom he feared to fight in duel then there remains but little else to do  but to arrange preliminaries i believe  are you prepared on every other point i am you will see that i am the challenger  and that he must now fight  what accident may turn up to save him  i fear not  but sure i am that he will endeavour to take every advantage that may arise  and so escape the encounter and what do you imagine he will do now he has accepted your challenge said mr  chillingworth  one would imagine he could not very well escape no but he accepted the challenge which charles holland sent him a duel was inevitable  and it seems to me to be a necessary consequence that he disappeared from amongst us  for mr  holland would never have shrunk from the encounter there can be no sort of suspicion about that  remarked chillingworth but allow me to advise you that you take care of yourself  and keep a watchful eye upon every one do not be seen out alone i fear not nay  the gentleman who has disappeared was  i am sure  fearless enough but yet that has not saved him  i would not advise you to be fearful only watchful  you have now an event awaiting upon you  which it is well you should go through with  unless circumstances should so turn out that it is needless  therefore i say  when you have the suspicions you do entertain of this man s conduct  beware  be cautious  and vigilant i will do so in the mean time  i trust myself confidently in your hands you know all that is necessary this affair is quite a secret from all of the family most certainly so  and will remain so i shall be at the hall and there i will see you but be careful not to be drawn into any adventure of any kind it is best to be on the safe side under all circumstances i will be especially careful  be assured  but farewell  see sir francis varney as early as you can  and let the meeting be as early as you can and thus diminish the chance of accident that i will attend to  farewell for the present mr  chillingworth immediately set about the conducting of the affair thus confided to him  and that no time might be lost  he determined to set out at once for sir francis varney s residence things with regard to this family seem to have gone on wild of late thought mr  chillingworth  this may bring affairs to a conclusion though i had much rather they had come to some other  my life for it there is a juggle or a mystery somewhere  i will do this  and then we shall see what will come of it  if this sir francis varney meets him and at this moment i can see no reason why he should not do so it will tend much to deprive him of the mystery about him  but if  on the other hand  he refuse but then that s all improbable  because he has agreed to do so  i fear  however  that such a man as varney is a dreadful enemy to encounter he is cool and unruffled and that gives him all the advantage in such affairs  but henry s nerves are not bad though shaken by these untowards events  but time will show i would it were all over with these thoughts and feelings strangely intermixed  mr  chillingworth set forward for sir francis varney s house                                    admiral bell slept soundly enough though  towards morning  he fell into a strange dream  and thought he was yard arm and yard arm with a strange fish something of the mermaid species well  exclaimed the admiral  after a customary benediction of his eyes and limbs  what s to come next  may i be spliced to a shark if i understand what this is all about  i had some grog last night  but then grog  d y see  is is a seaman s native element  as the newspapers say though i never read em now  it s such a plague he lay quiet for a short time  considering in his own mind what was best to be done  and what was the proper course to pursue  and why he should dream hilloa  hilloa  hil loa  jack a hoy  a hoy  shouted the admiral  as a sudden recollection of his challenge came across his memory  jack pringle a hoy  d n you  where are you you re never at hand when you are wanted  oh  you lubber a hoy a hoy  shouted a voice  as the door opened  and jack thrust his head in  what cheer  messmate  what ship is this oh  you lubberly the door was shut in a minute  and jack pringle disappeared hilloa  jack pringle  you don t mean to say you ll desert your colours do you  you dumb dog who says i ll desert the ship as she s sea worthy then why do you go away because i won t be called lubberly  i m as good a man as ever swabbed a deck  and don t care who says to the contrary  i ll stick to the ship as long as she s seaworthy  said jack well  come here  and just listen to the log  and be d d to you what s the orders now  admiral  said jack  though  as we are paid off there  take that  will you  said admiral bell  as he flung a pillow at jack  being the only thing in the shape of a missile within reach jack ducked  and the pillow produced a clatter in the washhand stand among the crockery  as jack said there s a mutiny in the ship  and hark how the cargo clatters  will you have it back again come  will you  i ve been dreaming  jack dreaming  what s that thinking of something when you are asleep  you swab ha  ha  ha  laughed jack  never did such a thing in my life ha  ha ha  what s the matter now i ll tell you what s the matter  jack pringle  you are becoming mutinous  and i won t have it  if you don t hold your jaw and draw in your slacks  i ll have another second another second  what s in the wind  now  said jack  is this the dream if ever i dream when i m alongside a strange craft  then it is a dream but old admiral bell ain t the man to sleep when there s any work to be done that s uncommon true  said jack  turning a quid well  then  i m going to fight fight  exclaimed jack  avast  there  i don t see where s the enemy none o  that gammon  jack pringle can fight  too  and will lay alongside his admiral  but he don t see the enemy anywhere you don t understand these things  so i ll tell you  i have had a bit of talk with sir francis varney  and i am going to fight him what the wamphigher  remarked jack  parenthetically yes well  then  resumed jack  then we shall see another blaze  at least afore we die  but he s an odd fish one of davy jones s sort i don t care about that  he may be anything he likes  but admiral bell ain t a going to have his nephew burned and eaten  and sucked like i don t know what  by a vampyre  or by any other confounded land shark in course  said jack  we ain t a going to put up with nothing of that sort  and if so be as how he has put him out of the way  why it s our duty to send him after him  and square the board that s the thing  jack  now you know you must go to sir francis varney and tell him you come from me i don t care if i goes on my own account  said jack that won t do  i ve challenged him and i must fight him in course you will  returned jack  and  if he blows you away  why i ll take your place  and have a blaze myself the admiral gave a look at jack of great admiration  and then said you are a d d good seaman  jack  but he s a knight  and might say no to that  but do you go to him  and tell him that you come from me to settle the when and the where this duel is to be fought single fight  said jack yes  consent to any thing that is fair  said the admiral  but let it be as soon as you can  now  do you understand what i have said yes  to be sure  i ain t lived all these years without knowing your lingo then go at once  and don t let the honour of admiral bell and old england suffer  jack  i m his man  you know  at any price never fear  said jack  you shall fight him  at any rate  i ll go and see he don t back out  the warmint then go along  jack  and mind don t you go blazing away like a fire ship  and letting everybody know what s going on  or it ll be stopped i ll not spoil sport  said jack  as he left the room  to go at once to sir francis varney  charged with the conducting of the important cartel of the admiral  jack made the best of his way with becoming gravity and expedition until he reached the gate of the admiral s enemy jack rang loudly at the gate  there seemed  if one might judge by his countenance  a something on his mind  that jack was almost another man the gate was opened by the servant  who inquired what he wanted there the wamphigher who the wamphigher the servant frowned  and was about to say something uncivil to jack  who winked at him very hard  and then said oh  may be you don t know him  or won t know him by that name  i wants to see sir francis varney he s at home  said the servant  who are you show me up  then  i m jack pringle  and i m come from admiral bell  i m the admiral s friend  you see  so none of your black looks the servant seemed amazed  as well as rather daunted  at jack s address he showed him  however  into the hall  where mr  chillingworth had just that moment arrived  and was waiting for an interview with varney chapter xxxviii marchdale s offer the consultation at bannerworth hall the morning of the duel illustration mr  chillingworth was much annoyed to see jack pringle in the hall  and jack was somewhat surprised at seeing mr  chillingworth there at that time in the rooming  they had but little time to indulge in their mutual astonishment  for a servant came to announce that sir francis varney would see them both without saying anything to the servant or each other  they ascended the staircase  and were shown into the apartment where sir francis varney received them gentlemen  said sir francis  in his usual bland tone  you are welcome sir francis  said mr  chillingworth  i have come upon matters of some importance  may i crave a separate audience and i too  said jack pringle  i come as the friend of admiral bell  i want a private audience  but  stay  i don t care a rope s end who knows who i am  or what i come about  say you are ready to name time and place  and i m as dumb as a figure head  that is saying something  at all events  and now i m done why  gentlemen  said sir francis  with a quiet smile  as you have both come upon the same errand  and as there may arise a controversy upon the point of precedence  you had better be both present  as i must arrange this matter myself upon due inquiry i do not exactly understand this  said mr  chillingworth  do you  mr pringle  perhaps you can enlighten me it  said jack  as how you came here upon the same errand as i  and i as you  why we both come about fighting sir francis varney yes  said sir francis  what mr  pringle says  is  i believe correct to a letter  i have a challenge from both your principals  and am ready to give you both the satisfaction you desire  provided the first encounter will permit me the honour of joining in the second  you  mr pringle  are aware of the chances of war i should say so  said jack  with a wink and a nod of a familiar character  i ve seen a few of them will you proceed to make the necessary agreement between you both gentlemen  my affection for the one equals fully the good will i bear the other  and i cannot give a preference in so delicate a matter proceed gentlemen mr  chillingworth looked at jack  and jack pringle looked at mr chillingworth  and then the former said well  the admiral means fighting  and i am come to settle the necessaries  pray let me know what are your terms  mr what d ye call em i am agreeable to anything that is at all reasonable pistols  i presume sir francis varney  said mr  chillingworth  i cannot consent to carry on this office  unless you can appoint a friend who will settle these matters with us myself  at least and i too  said jack pringle  we don t want to bear down an enemy admiral bell ain t the man to do that  and if he were  i m not the man to back him in doing what isn t fair or right  but he won t do it but  gentlemen  this must not be  mr  henry bannerworth must not be disappointed  and admiral bell must not be disappointed  moreover  i have accepted the two cartels  and i am ready and willing to fight one at a time  i presume sir francis  after what you have said  i must take upon myself  on the part of mr  henry bannerworth  to decline meeting you  if you cannot name a friend with whom i can arrange this affair ah  said jack pringle  that s right enough  i recollect very well when jack mizeu fought tom foremast  they had their seconds  admiral bell can t do anything in the dark  no  no  d e  all must be above board gentlemen  said sir francis varney  you see the dilemma i am in  your principals have both challenged me  i am ready to fight any one  or both of them  as the case may be  distinctly understand that  because it is a notion of theirs that i will not do so  or that i shrink from them  but i am a stranger in this neighbourhood  and have no one whom i could call upon to relinquish so much  as they run the risk of doing by attending me to the field then your acquaintances are no friends  d e  said jack pringle spitting through his teeth into the bars of a beautifully polished grate  i d stick to anybody the devil himself  leave alone a vampyre if so be as how i had been his friends and drunk grog from the same can  they are a set of lubbers i have not been here long enough to form any such friendships  mr chillingworth  but can confidently rely upon your honour and that of your principal  and will freely and fairly meet him but  sir francis  you forget the fact  in transacting  myself for mr  bannerworth  and this person or admiral bell  we do match  and have our own characters at stake  nay more  our lives and fortunes  these may be small  but they are everything to us  allow me to say  on my own behalf  that i will not permit my principal to meet you unless you can name a second  as is usual with gentlemen on such occasions i regret  while i declare to you my entire willingness to meet you that i cannot comply through utter inability to do so  with your request  let this go forth to the world as i have stated it  and let it be an answer to any aspersions that may be uttered as to my unwillingness to fight there was a pause of some moments  mr  chillingworth was resolved that come of it what would  he would not permit henry to fight  unless sir francis varney himself should appoint a friend  and then they could meet upon equal terms jack pringle whistled  and spit  and chewed and turned his quid hitched up his trousers  and looked wistfully from one to the other  as he said so then it s likely to be no fight at all  sir francis what s o name it seems like it  mr  pringle  replied varney  with a meaning smile unless you can be more complaisant towards myself  and kind towards the admiral why  not exactly that  said jack  it s a pity to stop a good play in the beginning  just because some little thing is wrong in the tackling perhaps your skill and genius may enable us to find some medium course that we may pursue with pleasure and profit  what say you  mr  pringle all i know about genius  as you call it is the flying dutchman  or some such odd out of the way fish  but  as i said  i am not one to spoil sport  nor more is the admiral  oh  no  we is all true men and good i believe it  said varney  bowing politely you needn t keep your figure head on the move  i can see you just as well  howsoever  as i was saying  i don t like to spoil sport  and sooner than both parties should be disappointed  my principal shall become your second  sir francis what  admiral bell  exclaimed varney  lifting his eyebrows with surprise what  charles holland s uncle  exclaimed mr  chillingworth  in accents of amazement and why not  said jack  with great gravity  i will pledge my word jack pringle s word that admiral bell shall be second to sir francis varney  during his scrimmage with mr  henry bannerworth  that will let the matter go on  there can be no back out then  eh  continued jack pringle  with a knowing nod at chillingworth as he spoke that will  i hope  remove your scruples  mr  chillingworth  said varney  with a courteous smile but will admiral bell do this his second says so  and has  i daresay  influence enough with him to induce that person to act in conformity with his promise in course he will  do you think he would be the man to hang back  oh no  he would be the last to leave jack pringle in the lurch no  depend upon it  sir francis  he ll be as sure to do what i say  as i have said it after that assurance  i cannot doubt it  said sir francis varney this act of kindness will  indeed  lay me under a deep and lasting obligation to admiral bell  which i fear i shall never be able to pay you need not trouble yourself about that  said jack pringle  the admiral will credit all  and you can pay off old scores when his turn comes in the field i will not forget  said varney  he deserves every consideration  but now  mr  chillingworth  i presume that we may come to some understanding respecting this meeting  which you were so kind as to do me the honour of seeking i cannot object to its taking place  i shall be most happy to meet your second in the field  and will arrange with him i imagine that  under the circumstances  that it will be barely necessary to go to that length of ceremony  future interviews can be arranged later  name the time and place  and after that we can settle all the rest on the ground yes  said jack  it will be time enough  surely  to see the admiral when we are upon the ground  i ll warrant the old buffer is a true brick as ever was  there s no flinching about him i am satisfied  said varney and i also  said chillingworth  but  understand  sir francis  any default for seconds makes the meeting a blank i will not doubt mr  pringle s honour so much as to believe it possible i m d d  said jack  if you ain t a trump card  and no mistake it s a great pity as you is a wamphigher the time  mr  chillingworth to morrow  at seven o clock  replied that gentleman the place  sir the best place that i can think of is a level meadow half way between here and bannerworth hall  but that is your privilege  sir francis varney i waive it  and am much obliged to you for the choice of the spot  it seems of the best character imaginable  i will be punctual i think we have nothing further to arrange now  said mr chillingworth  you will meet with admiral bell certainly  i believe there is nothing more to be done  this affair is very satisfactorily arranged  and much better than i anticipated good morning  sir francis  said mr  chillingworth  good morning adieu  said sir francis  with a courteous salutation  good day  mr pringle  and commend me to the admiral  whose services will be of infinite value to me don t mention it  said jack  the admiral s the man as d lend any body a helping hand in case of distress like the present  and i ll pledge my word jack pringle s too  as that he ll do what s right  and give up his turn to mr  henry bannerworth  cause you see he can have his turn arterwards  you know it s only waiting awhile that s all  said sir francis jack pringle made a sea bow and took his leave  as he followed mr chillingworth  and they both left the house together  to return to bannerworth hall well  said mr  chillingworth  i am glad that sir francis varney has got over the difficulty of having no seconds  for it would not be proper or safe to meet a man without a friend for him it ain t the right thing  said jack hitching up his trousers  but i was afeard as how he would back out  and that would be just the wrong thing for the admiral  he d go raving mad they had got but very few paces from sir francis varney s house  when they were joined by marchdale ah  he said  as he came up  i see you have been to sir francis varney s  if i may judge from the direction whence you re coming  and your proximity yes  we have  said mr  chillingworth  i thought you had left these parts i had intended to do so  replied marchdale  but second thoughts are sometimes best  you know certainly i have so much friendship for the family at the hall  that notwithstanding i am compelled to be absent from the mansion itself  yet i cannot quit the neighbourhood while there are circumstances of such a character hanging about them  i will remain  and see if there be not something arising  in which i may be useful to them in some matter it is very disinterested of you  you will remain here for some time  i suppose yes  undoubtedly  unless  as i do not anticipate  i should see any occasion to quit my present quarters i tell you what it is  said jack pringle  if you had been here half an hour earlier you could have seconded the wamphigher seconded yes  we re here to challenge a double challenge yes  but in confiding this matter to you  mr  marchdale  you will make no use of it to the exploding of this affair  by so doing you will seriously damage the honour of mr  henry bannerworth i will not  you may rely upon it  but mr  chillingworth  do i not see you in the character of a second you do  sir to mr  henry the same  sir have you reflected upon the probable consequences of such an act should any serious mischief occur what i have undertaken  mr  marchdale  i will go through with  the consequences i have duly considered  and yet you see me in the character of mr  henry bannerworth s friend i am happy to see you as such  and i do not think henry could find a better  but this is beside the question  what induced me to make the remark was this had i been at the hall  you will admit that henry bannerworth would have chosen myself  without any disparagement to you mr  chillingworth well sir  what then why i am a single man  i can live  reside and go any where  one country will suit me as well as another  i shall suffer no loss  but as for you you will be ruined in every particular  for if you go in the character of a second  you will not be excused  for all the penalties incurred your profession of a surgeon will not excuse you i see all that  sir what i propose is  that you should accompany the parties to the field but in your own proper character of surgeon  and permit me to take that of second to mr  bannerworth this cannot be done  unless by mr  henry bannerworth s consent  said mr  chillingworth then i will accompany you to bannerworth hall  and see mr  henry  whom i will request to permit me to do what i have mentioned to you mr  chillingworth could not but admit the reasonableness of this proposal  and it was agreed they should return to bannerworth hall in company here they arrived in a very short time after  and entered together and now  said mr  chillingworth  i will go and bring our two principals  who will be as much astonished to find themselves engaged in the same quarrel  as i was to find myself sent on a similar errand to sir francis with our friend mr  john pringle oh  not john jack pringle  you mean  said that individual chillingworth now went in search of henry  and sent him to the apartment where mr  marchdale was with jack pringle  and then he found the admiral waiting the return of jack with impatience admiral  he said  i perceive you are unwell this morning unwell be d d  said the admiral  starting up with surprise  who ever heard that old admiral bell looked ill just afore he was going into action  i say it s a scandalous lie admiral  admiral  i didn t say you were ill  only you looked ill a a little nervous  or so  rather pale  eh  is it not so confound you  do you think i want to be physicked  i tell you  i have not a little but a great inclination to give you a good keelhauling  i don t want a doctor just yet but it may not be so long  you know  admiral  but there is jack pringle a waiting you below  will you go to him  there is a particular reason he has something to communicate from sir francis varney  i believe the admiral gave a look of some amazement at mr  chillingworth  and then he said  muttering to himself if jack pringle should have betrayed me but  no  he could not do that he is too true  i m sure of jack  and how did that son of a gallipot hint about the odd fish i sent jack to filled with a dubious kind of belief which he had about something he had heard of jack pringle  he entered the room  where he met marchdale  jack pringle  and henry bannerworth  immediately afterwards  mr chillingworth entered the apartment i have  said he  been to sir francis varney  and there had an interview with him  and with mr  pringle  when i found we were both intent upon the same object  namely  an encounter with the knight by our principals eh  said the admiral what  exclaimed henry  had he challenged you  admiral challenged me  exclaimed admiral bell  with a round oath i however since it comes to this  i must admit i challenged him that s what i did  said henry bannerworth  after a moment s thought and i perceive we have both fallen into the same line of conduct that is the fact  said mr  chillingworth  both mr  pringle and i went there to settle the preliminaries  and we found an insurmountable bar to any meeting taking place at all he wouldn t fight  then  exclaimed henry  i see it all now not fight  said admiral bell  with a sort of melancholy disappointment  d n the cowardly rascal  tell me  jack pringle  what did the long horse marine looking slab say to it  he told me he would fight  why he ought to be made to stand sentry over the wind you challenged him in person  too  i suppose  said henry yes  confound him  i went there last night and i too it seems to me  said marchdale  that this affair has been not indiscretely conducted  but somewhat unusually and strangely  to say the least of it you see  said chillingworth  sir francis was willing to fight both henry and the admiral  as he told us yes  said jack  he told us he would fight us both  if so be as his light was not doused in the first brush that was all that was wanted  said the admiral we could expect no more but then he desired to meet you without any second  but  of course  i would not accede to this proposal  the responsibility was too great and too unequally borne by the parties engaged in the rencontre decidedly  said henry  but it is unfortunate very unfortunate very  said the admiral very  what a rascally thing it is there ain t another rogue in the country to keep him in countenance illustration i thought it was a pity to spoil sport  said jack pringle  it was a pity a good intention should be spoiled  and i promised the wamphigher that if as how he would fight  you should second him  and you d meet him to do so eh  who  i  exclaimed the admiral in some perplexity yes  that is the truth  said mr  chillingworth  mr pringle said you would do so  and he then and there pledged his word that you should meet him on the ground and second him yes  said jack you must do it  i knew you would not spoil sport  and that there had better be a fight than no fight  i believe you d sooner see a scrimmage than none  and so it s all arranged very well  said the admiral  i only wish mr  henry bannerworth had been his second  i think i was entitled to the first meeting no  said jack  you warn t  for mr  chillingworth was there first first come first served  you know well  well  i mustn t grumble at another man s luck  mine ll come in turn  but it had better be so than a disappointment altogether  i ll be second to this sir francis varney  he shall have fair play  as i m an admiral  but  d e he shall fight yes  yes  he shall fight and to this conclusion i would come  said henry  i wish him to fight now i will take care that he shall not have any opportunity of putting me on one side quietly there is one thing  observed marchdale  that i wished to propose after what has passed  i should not have returned  had i not some presentiment that something was going forward in which i could be useful to my friend oh  said the admiral  with a huge twist of his countenance what i was about to say was this mr  chillingworth has much to lose as he is situated  and i nothing as i am placed  i am chained down to no spot of earth  i am above following a profession my means  i mean place me above the necessity  now  henry  allow me to be your second in this affair  allow mr  chillingworth to attend in his professional capacity  he may be of service of great service to one of the principals  whereas  if he go in any other capacity  he will inevitably have his own safety to consult that is most unquestionably true  said henry  and  to my mind  the best plan that can be proposed  what say you  admiral bell  will you act with mr  marchdale in this affair oh  i yes certainly i don t care  mr  marchdale is mr  marchdale  i believe  and that s all i care about  if we quarrel to day  and have anything to do to morrow  in course  to morrow i can put off my quarrel for next day  it will keep that s all i have to say at present then this is a final arrangement  said mr  chillingworth it is but  mr  bannerworth  in resigning my character of second to mr marchdale  i only do so because it appears and seems to be the opinion of all present that i can be much better employed in another capacity certainly  mr  chillingworth  and i cannot but feel that i am under the same obligations to you for the readiness and zeal with which you have acted i have done what i have done  said chillingworth  because i believed it was my duty to do so mr  chillingworth has undoubtedly acted most friendly and efficiently in this affair  said marchdale  and he does not relinquish the part for the purpose of escaping a friendly deed  but to perform one in which he may act in a capacity that no one else can that is true  said the admiral and now  said chillingworth  you are to meet to morrow morning in the meadow at the bottom of the valley  half way between here and sir francis varney s house  at seven o clock in the morning more conversation passed among them  and it was agreed that they should meet early the next morning  and that  of course  the affair should be kept a secret marchdale for that night should remain in the house  and the admiral should appear as if little or nothing was the matter  and he and jack pringle retired  to talk over in private all the arrangements henry bannerworth and marchdale also retired  and mr  chillingworth after a time  retired  promising to be with them in time for the meeting next morning much of that day was spent by henry bannerworth in his own apartment  in writing documents and letters of one kind and another  but at night he had not finished  for he had been compelled to be about  and in flora s presence  to prevent anything from being suspected marchdale was much with him  and in secret examined the arms ammunition  and bullets  and saw all was right for the next morning  and when he had done  he said now  henry  you must permit me to insist that you take some hours repose  else you will scarcely be as you ought to be very good  said henry  i have just finished  and can take your advice after many thoughts and reflections  henry bannerworth fell into a deep sleep  and slept several hours in calmness and quietude  and at an early hour he awoke  and saw marchdale sitting by him is it time  marchdale  i have not overslept myself  have i no  time enough time enough  said marchdale  i should have let you sleep longer  but i should have awakened you in good time it was now the grey light of morning  and henry arose and began to prepare for the encounter  marchdale stole to admiral bell s chamber but he and jack pringle were ready few words were spoken  and those few were in a whisper  and the whole party left the hall in as noiseless a manner as possible  it was a mild morning  and yet it was cold at that time of the morning  just as day is beginning to dawn in the east  there was  however  ample time to reach the rendezvous it was a curious party that which was now proceeding towards the spot appointed for the duel  the result of which might have so important an effect on the interests of those who were to be engaged in it it would be difficult for us to analyse the different and conflicting emotions that filled the breasts of the various individuals composing that party the hopes and fears the doubts and surmises that were given utterance to  though we are compelled to acknowledge that though to henry  the character of the man he was going to meet in mortal fight was of a most ambiguous and undefined nature  and though no one could imagine the means he might be endowed with for protection against the arms of man henry  as we said  strode firmly forward with unflinching resolution  his heart was set on recovering the happiness of his sister and he would not falter so far  then  we may consider that at length proceedings of a hostile character were so far clearly and fairly arranged between henry bannerworth and that most mysterious being who certainly  from some cause or another  had betrayed no inclination to meet an opponent in that manner which is sanctioned  bad as it is  by the usages of society but whether his motive was one of cowardice or mercy  remained yet to be seen  it might be that he feared himself receiving some mortal injury which would at once put a stop to that preternatural career of existence which he affected to shudder at  and yet evidently took considerable pains to prolong upon the other hand  it is just possible that some consciousness of invulnerability on his own part  or of great power to injure his antagonist  might be the cause why he had held back so long from fighting the duel  and placed so many obstacles in the way of the usual necessary arrangements incidental to such occasions now  however  there would seem to be no possible means of escape  sir francis varney must fight or fly  for he was surrounded by too many opponents to be sure he might have appealed to the civil authorities to protect him  and to sanction him in his refusal to commit what undoubtedly is a legal offence  but then there cannot be a question that the whole of the circumstances would come out  and meet the public eye the result of which would be  his acquisition of a reputation as unenviable as it would be universal it had so happened  that the peculiar position of the bannerworth family kept their acquaintance within extremely narrow limits  and greatly indisposed them to set themselves up as marks for peculiar observation once holding  as they had  a proud position in the county  and being looked upon quite as magnates of the land  they did not now court the prying eye of curiosity to look upon their poverty  but rather with a gloomy melancholy they lived apart  and repelled the advances of society by a cold reserve  which few could break through had this family suffered in any noble cause  or had the misfortunes which had come over them  and robbed their ancestral house of its lustre  been an unavoidable dispensation of providence  they would have borne the hard position with a different aspect  but it must be remembered  that to the faults  the vices  and the criminality of some of their race  was to be attributed their present depressed state it has been seen during the progress of our tale  that its action has been tolerably confined to bannerworth hall  its adjacent meadows  and the seat of sir francis varney  the only person at any distance  knowing anything of the circumstances  or feeling any interest in them  being mr  chillingworth  the surgeon  who  from personal feeling  as well as from professional habit  was not likely to make a family s affairs a subject of gossip a change  however  was at hand a change of a most startling and alarming character to varney one which he might expect  yet not be well prepared for this period of serenity was to pass away  and he was to become most alarmingly popular  we will not  however  anticipate  but proceed at once to detail as briefly as may be the hostile meeting it would appear that varney  now that he had once consented to the definitive arrangements of a duel  shrunk not in any way from carrying them out  nor in the slightest attempted to retard arrangements which might be fatal to himself the early morning was one of those cloudy ones so frequently occurring in our fickle climate  when the cleverest weather prophet would find it difficult to predict what the next hour might produce there was a kind of dim gloominess over all objects  and as there were no bright lights  there were no deep shadows the consequence of which was a sureness of effect over the landscape  that robbed it of many of its usual beauties such was the state of things when marchdale accompanied henry and admiral bell from bannerworth hall across the garden in the direction of the hilly wood  close to which was the spot intended for the scene of encounter jack pringle came on at a lazy pace behind with his hands in his pockets  and looking as unconcerned as if he had just come out for a morning s stroll  and scarcely knew whether he saw what was going on or not the curious contortion into which he twisted his countenance  and the different odd looking lumps that appeared in it from time to time  may be accounted for by a quid of unusual size  which he seemed to be masticating with a relish quite horrifying to one unused to so barbarous a luxury the admiral had strictly enjoined him not to interfere on pain of being considered a lubber and no seaman for the remainder of his existence threatened penalties which  of course  had their own weight with jack  and accordingly he came just  to see the row in as quiet a way as possible  perhaps not without a hope  that something might turn up in the shape of a causus belli  that might justify him in adopting a threatening attitude towards somebody now  master henry  said the admiral  none of your palaver to me as we go along  recollect i don t belong to your party  you know  i ve stood friend to two or three fellows in my time  but if anybody had said to me  admiral bell  the next time you go out on a quiet little shooting party  it will be as second to a vampyre  i d have said you re a liar howsomever  d me  here you goes  and what i mean to say is this  mr henry  that i d second even a frenchman rather than he shouldn t fight when he s asked that s liberal of you  said henry  at all event i believe you it is  said the admiral  so mind if you don t hit him i m not a going to tell you how all you ve got to do  is to fire low but that s no business of mine  shiver my timbers  i oughtn t to tell you  but d n you  hit him if you can admiral  said henry  i can hardly think you are even preserving a neutrality in the matter  putting aside my own partisanship as regards your own man oh  hang him  i m not going to let him creep out of the thing on such a shabby pretence  i can tell you  i think i ought to have gone to his house this morning  only  as i said i never would cross his threshold again  i won t i wonder if he ll come  said mr marchdale to henry  after all  you know he may take to flight  and shun an encounter which  it is evident he has entered into but tardily i hope not  said henry  and yet i must own that your supposition has several times crossed my mind  if  however  he do not meet me  he never can appear at all in the country  and we should  at least  be rid of him  and all his troublesome importunities concerning the hall  i would not allow that man  on any account  to cross the threshold of my house as its tenant or its owner why  it ain t usual  said the admiral  to let ones house to two people at once  unless you seem quite to forget that i ve taken yours  i may as well remind you of it hurra  said jack pringle  at this moment what s the matter with you  who told you to hurra enemy in the offing  said jack  three or four pints to the sou west so he is  by jove  dodging about among the trees  come  now  this vampyre s a decenter fellow than i thought him  he means  after all  to let us have a pop at him they had now reached so close to the spot  that sir francis varney  who to all appearance  had been waiting  emerged from among the trees rolled up in his dismal looking cloak  and  if possible  looking longer and thinner than ever he had looked before his face wore a singular cadaverous looking aspect  his very lips were white and there was a curious  pinkish looking circle round each of his eyes  that imparted to his whole countenance a most uninviting appearance  he turned his eyes from one to the other of those who were advancing towards him  until he saw the admiral  upon which he gave such a grim and horrible smile  that the old man exclaimed i say  jack  you lubber  there s a face for a figure head ay  ay  sir did you ever see such a d d grin as that in your life  in any latitude ay  ay  sir you did you swab i should think so it s a lie  and you know it very good  said jack  don t you recollect when that ere iron bullet walked over your head  leaving a nice little nick  all the way off bergen ap zoom  that was the time blessed if you didn t give just such a grin as that i didn t  you rascal and i say you did mutiny  by god go to blazes how far this contention might have gone  having now reached its culminating point  had the admiral and jack been alone  it is hard to say  but as it was  henry and marchdale interfered  and so the quarrel was patched up for the moment  in order to give place to more important affairs varney seemed to think  that after the smiling welcome he had given to his second  he had done quite enough  for there he stood  tall  and gaunt  and motionless  if we may except an occasional singular movement of the mouth  and a clap together of his teeth  at times  which was enough to make anybody jump to hear for heaven s sake  said marchdale  do not let us trifle at such a moment as this  mr  pringle  you really had no business here mr  who  said jack pringle  i believe  is your name  returned marchdale it were  but blowed if ever i was called mister before the admiral walked up to sir francis varney  and gave him a nod that looked much more like one of defiance than of salutation  to which the vampyre replied by a low  courtly bow oh  bother  muttered the old admiral  if i was to double up my backbone like that  i should never get it down straight again  well all s right  you ve come  that s all you could do  i suppose i am here  said varney  and therefore it becomes a work of supererogation to remark that i ve come oh  does it  i never bolted a dictionary  and  therefore  i don t know exactly what you mean step aside with me a moment  admiral bell  and i will tell you what you are to do with me after i am shot  if such should be my fate do with you  d d if i ll do anything with you i don t expect you will regret me  you will eat eat yes  and drink as usual  no doubt  notwithstanding being witness to the decease of a fellow creature belay there  don t call yourself a fellow creature of mine  i ain t a vampyre but there s no knowing what you may be  and now listen to my instructions  for as you re my second  you cannot very well refuse to me a few friendly offices  rain is falling  step beneath this ancient tree and i will talk to you chapter xxxix the storm and the fight the admiral s repudiation of his principal illustration well  said the admiral  when they were fairly under the tree  upon the leaves of which the pattering rain might be heard falling  well what is it if your young friend  mr  bannerworth  should chance to send a pistol bullet through any portion of my anatomy  prejudicial to the prolongation of my existence  you will be so good as not to interfere with anything i may have about me  or to make any disturbance whatever you may depend i sha n t just take the matter perfectly easy as a thing of course oh  i mean d d easy ha  what a delightful thing is friendship  there is a little knoll or mound of earth midway between here and the hall  do you happen to know it  there is one solitary tree glowing near its summit an oriental looking tree  of the fir tribe  which  fan like  spreads its deep green leaves  across the azure sky oh  bother it  it s a d d old tree  growing upon a little bit of a hill  i suppose you mean precisely  only much more poetically expressed  the moon rises at a quarter past four to night  or rather to morrow  morning does it yes  and if i should happen to be killed  you will have me removed gently to this mound of earth  and there laid beneath this tree  with my face upwards  and take care that it is done before the moon rises  you can watch that no one interferes a likely job  what the deuce do you take me for  i tell you what it is mr  vampyre  or varney  or whatever s your name  if you should chance to be hit  where ever you chance to fall  there you ll lie how very unkind uncommon  ain t it well  well  since that is your determination  i must take care of myself in another way  i can do so  and i will take care of yourself how you like  for all i care  i ve come here to second you  and to see that  on the honour of a seaman  if you are put out of the world  it s done in a proper manner  that s all i have to do with you now you know sir francis varney looked after him with a strange kind of smile  as he walked away to make the necessary preparation with marchdale for the immediate commencement of the contest these were simple and brief  it was agreed that twelve paces should be measured out  six each way  from a fixed point  one six to be paced by the admiral  and the other by marchdale  then they were to draw lots  to see at which end of this imaginary line varney was to be placed  after this the signal for firing was to be one  two  three fire a few minutes sufficed to complete these arrangements  the ground was measured in the manner we have stated  and the combatants placed in their respective positions  sir francis varney occupying the same spot where he had at first stood  namely  that nearest to the little wood and to his own residence it is impossible that under such circumstances the bravest and the calmest of mankind could fail to feel some slight degree of tremour or uneasiness  and  although we can fairly claim for henry bannerworth that he was as truly courageous as any right feeling christian man could wish to be  yet when it was possible that he stood within  as it were  a hair s breadth of eternity  a strange world of sensation and emotions found a home in his heart  and he could not look altogether undaunted on that future which might  for all he knew to the contrary  be so close at hand  as far as he was concerned it was not that he feared death  but that he looked with a decent gravity upon so grave a change as that from this world to the next  and hence was it that his face was pale  and that he looked all the emotion which he really felt this was the aspect and the bearing of a brave but not a reckless man while sir francis varney  on the other hand  seemed  now that he had fairly engaged in the duel  to look upon it and its attendant circumstances with a kind of smirking satisfaction  as if he were far more amused than personally interested this was certainly the more extraordinary after the manner in which he had tried to evade the fight  and  at all events  was quite a sufficient proof that cowardice had not been his actuating motive in so doing the admiral  who stood on a level with him  could not see the sort of expression he wore  or  probably  he would have been far from well pleased  but the others did  and they found something inexpressibly disagreeable in the smirking kind of satisfaction with which the vampyre seemed to regard now the proceedings confound him  whispered marchdale to henry  one would think he was quite delighted  instead  as we had imagined him  not well pleased  at these proceedings  look how he grins it is no matter  said henry  let him wear what aspect he may  it is the same to me  and  as heaven is my judge  i here declare  if i did not think myself justified in so doing  i would not raise my hand against this man there can be no shadow of a doubt regarding your justification  have at him  and heaven protect you amen the admiral was to give the word to fire  and now he and marshal having stepped sufficiently on one side to be out of all possible danger from any stray shot  he commenced repeating the signal are you ready  gentlemen once they looked sternly at each other  and each grasped his pistol twice sir francis varney smiled and looked around him  as if the affair were one of the most common place description thrice varney seemed to be studying the sky rather than attending to the duel fire  said the admiral  and one report only struck upon the ear  it was that from henry s pistol all eyes were turned upon sir francis varney  who had evidently reserved his fire  for what purpose could not be devised  except a murderous one the taking of a more steady aim at henry sir francis  however  seemed in no hurry  but smiled significantly  and gradually raised the point of his weapon did you hear the word  sir francis  i gave it loud enough  i am sure  i never spoke plainer in my life  did i ever  jack yes  often  said jack pringle  what s the use of your asking such yarns as them  you know you have done so often enough when you wanted grog you d d rascal  i ll i ll have your back scored  i will so you will  when you are afloat again  which you never will be you re paid off  that s certain you lubberly lout  you ain t a seaman  a seaman would never mutiny against his admiral  howsomever  do you hear  sir francis  i ll give the matter up  if you don t pay some attention to me henry looked steadily at varney  expecting every moment to feel his bullet  mr  marchdale hastily exclaimed that this was not according to usage sir francis varney took no notice  but went on elevating his weapon when it was perpendicular to the earth he fired in the air i had not anticipated this  said marchdale  as he walked to henry  i thought he was taking a more deadly aim and i  said henry ay  you have escaped  henry  let me congratulate you not so fast  we may fire again i can afford to do that  he said  with a smile you should have fired  sir  according to custom  said the admiral this is not the proper thing what  fire at your friend oh  that s all very well  you are my friend for a time  vampyre as you are  and i intend you shall fire if mr  henry bannerworth demands another fire  i have no objection to it  and will fire at him  but as it is i shall not do so  indeed  it would be quite useless for him to do so to point mortal weapons at me is mere child s play  they will not hurt me the devil they won t  said the admiral why  look you here  said sir francis varney  stepping forward and placing his hand to his neckerchief  look you here  if mr  henry bannerworth should demand another fire  he may do so with the same bullet the same bullet  said marchdale  stepping forward the same bullet how is this my eyes  said jack  who d a thought it  there s a go  wouldn t he do for a dummy to lead a forlorn hope  or to put among the boarders here  said sir francis  handing a bullet to henry bannerworth here is the bullet you shot at me henry looked at it it was blackened by powder  and then marchdale seized it and tried it in the pistol  but found the bullet fitted henry s weapon by heavens  it is so  he exclaimed  stepping back and looking at varney from top to toe in horror and amazement d e  said the admiral  if i understand this  why jack pringle  you dog  here s a strange fish on  no  there s plenty on um in some countries will you insist upon another fire  or may i consider you satisfied i shall object  said marchdale  henry  this affair must go no further  it would be madness worse than madness  to fight upon such terms so say i  said the admiral  i will not have anything to do with you sir francis  i ll not be your second any longer  i didn t bargain for such a game as this  you might as well fight with the man in brass armour  at the lord mayor s show  or the champion at a coronation oh  said jack pringle  a man may as well fire at the back of a halligator as a wamphigher this must be considered as having been concluded  said mr  marchdale no  said henry and wherefore not because i have not received his fire heaven forbid you should i may not with honour quit the ground without another fire under ordinary circumstances there might be some shadow of an excuse for your demand  but as it is there is none  you have neither honour nor credit to gain by such an encounter  and  certainly  you can gain no object how are we to decide this affair  am i considered absolved from the accusation under which i lay  of cowardice  inquired sir francis varney  with a cold smile why  as for that  said the admiral  i should as soon expect credit for fighting behind a wall  as with a man that i couldn t hit any more than the moon henry  let me implore you to quit this scene  it can do no good at this moment  a noise  as of human voices  was heard at a distance this caused a momentary pause  and  the whole party stood still and listened the murmurs and shouts that now arose in the distance were indistinct and confused what can all this mean  said marchdale  there is something very strange about it  i cannot imagine a cause for so unusual an occurrence nor i  said sir francis varney  looking suspiciously at henry bannerworth upon my honour i know neither what is the cause nor the nature of the sounds themselves then we can easily see what is the matter from yonder hillock  said the admiral  and there s jack pringle  he s up there already  what s he telegraphing about in that manner  i wonder the fact was  jack pringle  hearing the riot  had thought that if he got to the neighbouring eminence he might possibly ascertain what it was that was the cause of what he termed the row  and had succeeded in some degree there were a number of people of all kinds coming out from the village apparently armed  and shouting  jack pringle hitched up his trousers and swore  then took off his hat and began to shout to the admiral  as he said d e  they are too late to spoil the sport  hilloa  hurrah what s all that about  jack  inquired the admiral  as he came puffing along  what s the squall about only a few horse marines and bumboat women  that have been startled like a company of penguins oh  my eyes  wouldn t a whole broadside set em flying  jack ay  just as them frenchmen that you murdered on board the big thunderer  as you called it i murder them  you rascal yes  there was about five hundred of them killed they were only shot they were killed  only your conscience tells you it s uncomfortable you rascal you villain  you ought to be keel hauled and well payed ay  you re payed  and paid off as an old hulk d e you you oh  i wish i had you on board ship  i d make your lubberly carcass like a union jack  full of red and blue stripes oh  it s all very well  but if you don t take to your heels  you ll have all the old women in the village a whacking on you  that s all i have to say about it  you d better port your helm and about ship  or you ll be keel hauled d n your what s the matter  inquired marchdale  as he arrived what s the cause of all the noise we have heard  said sir francis has some village festival spontaneously burst forth among the rustics of this place i cannot tell the cause of it  said henry bannerworth  but they seem to me to be coming towards this place indeed i think so too  said marchdale with what object  inquired sir francis varney no peaceable one  observed henry  for  as far i can observe  they struck across the country  as though they would enclose something  or intercept somebody indeed  but why come here if i knew that i could have at once told the cause and they appear armed with a variety of odd weapons  observed sir francis  they mean an attack upon some one  who is that man with them he seems to be deprecating their coming that appears to be mr  chillingworth  said henry  i think that is he yes  observed the admiral  i think i know the build of that craft he s been in our society before  i always know a ship as soon as i see it does you  though  said jack yea  what do you mean  eh  let me hear what you ve got to say against your captain and your admiral  you mutinous dog  you tell me  i say so i will  you thought you were fighting a big ship in a fog  and fired a dozen broadsides or so  and it was only the flying dutchman  or the devil you infernal dog well  you know it was  it might a been our own shadow for all i can tell  indeed  i think it was you think yes that s mutiny  i ll have no more to do with you  jack pringle  you re no seaman  and have no respect for your officer  now sheer off  or i ll cut your yards why  as for my yards  i ll square em presently if i like  you old swab  but as for leaving you  very well  you have said so  and you shall be accommodated  d e  however  it was not so when your nob was nearly rove through with a boarding pike  it wasn t i ll have no more to do with jack pringle  then  it was more t other well  then  why be so mutinous because you aggrawates me the cries of the mob became more distinct as they drew nearer to the party  who began to evince some uneasiness as to their object surely  said marchdale  mr  chillingworth has not named anything respecting the duel that has taken place no  no but he was to have been here this morning  said the admiral  i understood he was to be here in his own character of a surgeon  and yet i have not seen him  have any of you no  said henry then here he comes in the character of conservator of the public peace  said varney  coldly  however  i believe that his errand will be useless since the affair is  i presume  concluded down with the vampyre eh  said the admiral  eh  what s that  eh  what did they say if you ll listen they ll tell you soon enough  i ll warrant may be they will  and yet i d like to know now sir francis varney looked significantly at marchdale  and then waited with downcast eyes for the repetition of the words down with the vampyre  resounded on all sides from the people who came rapidly towards them  and converging towards a centre  burn  destroy and kill the vampyre  no vampyre  burn him out  down with him  kill him illustration then came mr  chillingworth s voice  who  with much earnestness endeavoured to exhort them to moderation  and to refrain from violence sir francis varney became very pale agitated  he immediately turned  and taking the least notice  he made for the wood  which lay between him and his own house  leaving the people in the greatest agitation mr  marchdale was not unmoved at this occurrence  but stood his ground with henry bannerworth  the admiral  and jack pringle  until the mob came very near to them  shouting  and uttering cries of vengeance  and death of all imaginable kinds that it was possible to conceive  against the unpopular vampyre pending the arrival of these infuriated persons  we will  in a few words  state how it was that so suddenly a set of circumstances arose productive of an amount of personal danger to varney  such as  up to that time  had seemed not at all likely to occur we have before stated there was but one person out of the family of the bannerworths who was able to say anything of a positive character concerning the singular and inexplicable proceedings at the hall  and that that person was mr  chillingworth  an individual not at all likely to become garrulous upon the subject but  alas  the best of men have their weaknesses  and we much regret to say that mr  chillingworth so far in this instance forgot that admirable discretion which commonly belonged to him  as to be the cause of the popular tumult which had now readied such a height in a moment of thoughtlessness and confidence  he told his wife  yes this really clever man  from whom one would not have expected such a piece of horrible indiscretion  actually told his wife all about the vampyre  but such is human nature  combined with an amount of firmness and reasoning power  that one would have thought to be invulnerable safeguards  we find some weakness which astonishes all calculation such was this of mr  chillingworth s  it is true  he cautioned the lady to be secret  and pointed to her the danger of making varney the vampyre a theme for gossip  but he might as well have whispered to a hurricane to be so good as not to go on blowing so  as request mrs  chillingworth to keep a secret of course she burst into the usual fervent declarations of who was she to tell  was she a person who went about telling things  when did she see anybody  not she  once in a blue moon  and then  when mr chillingworth went out  like the king of otaheite  she invited the neighbours round about to come to take some tea under solemn promises of secrecy  sixteen ladies that evening were made acquainted with the full and interesting particulars of the attack of the vampyre on flora bannerworth  and all the evidence inculpating sir francis varney as the blood thirsty individual when the mind comes to consider that these sixteen ladies multiplied their information by about four and twenty each  we become quite lost in a sea of arithmetic  and feel compelled to sum up the whole by a candid assumption that in four and twenty hours not an individual in the whole town was ignorant of the circumstances on the morning before the projected duel  there was an unusual commotion in the streets  people were conversing together in little knots  and using rather violent gesticulations  poor mr  chillingworth  he alone was ignorant of the causes of the popular commotion  and so he went to bed wondering that an unusual bustle pervaded the little market town but not at all guessing its origin somehow or another  however  the populace  who had determined to make a demonstration on the following morning against the vampyre  thought it highly necessary first to pay some sort of compliment to mr chillingworth  and  accordingly  at an early hour  a great mob assembled outside his house  and gave three terrific applauding shouts  which roused him most unpleasantly from his sleep  and induced the greatest astonishment at the cause of such a tumult oh  that artful mrs  chillingworth  too well she knew what was the matter  yet she pretended to be so oblivious upon the subject good god  cried mr  chillingworth  as he started up in bed  what s all that all what  said his wife all what  do you mean to say you heard nothing well  i think i did hear a little sort of something a little sort of something  it shook the house well  well  never mind  go to sleep again  it s no business of ours yes  but it may be  though  it s all very well to say go to sleep that happens to be a thing i can t do  there s something amiss well  what s that to you perhaps nothing  but  perhaps  everything mr  chillingworth sprang from his bed  and began dressing  a process which he executed with considerable rapidity  and in which he was much accelerated by two or three supplementary shouts from the people below then  in a temporary lull  a loud voice shouted down with the vampyre down with the vampyre the truth in an instant burst over the mind of mr  chillingworth  and turning to his wife  he exclaimed i understand it now  you ve been gossipping about sir francis varney and have caused all this tumult i gossip  well  i never  lay it on me  it s sure to be my fault  i might have known that beforehand  i always am but you must have spoken of it who have i got to speak to about it did you  or did you not who should i tell mr  chillingworth was dressed  and he hastened down and entered the street with great desperation  he had a hope that he might be enabled to disperse the crowd  and yet be in time to keep his appointment at the duel his appearance was hailed with another shout  for it was considered  of course  that he had come to join in the attack upon sir francis varney he found assembled a much more considerable mob than he had imagined and to his alarm he found many armed with all sorts of weapons of offence hurrah  cried a great lumpy looking fellow  who seemed half mad with the prospect of a disturbance  hurrah  here s the doctor  he ll tell us all about it as we go along  come on for heaven s sake  said mr  chillingworth  stop  what are you about to do all of you burn the vampyre burn the vampyre hold hold  this is folly  let me implore you all to return to your homes  or you will get into serious trouble on this subject this was a piece of advice not at all likely to be adopted  and when the mob found that mr  chillingworth was not disposed to encourage and countenance it in its violence  it gave another loud shout of defiance and moved off through the long straggling streets of the town in a direction towards sir francis varney s house it is true that what were called the authorities of the town had become alarmed  and were stirring  but they found themselves in such a frightful minority  that it became out of the question for them to interfere with any effect to stop the lawless proceedings of the rioters  so that the infuriated populace had it all their own way  and in a straggling  disorderly looking kind of procession they moved off vowing vengeance as they went against varney the vampyre hopeless as mr  chillingworth thought it was to interfere with any degree of effect in the proceedings of the mob  he still could not reconcile it to himself to be absent from a scene which he now felt certain had been produced by his own imprudence  so he went on with the crowd  endeavouring  as he did so  by every argument that could be suggested to him to induce them to abstain from the acts of violence they contemplated  he had a hope  too  that when they reached sir francis varney s  finding him not within  as probably would be the case as by that time he would have started to meet henry bannerworth on the ground  to fight the duel  he might induce the mob to return and forego their meditated violence and thus was it that  urged on by a multitude of persons  the unhappy surgeon was expiating  both in mind and person  the serious mistakes he had committed in trusting a secret to his wife let it not be supposed that we for one moment wish to lay down a general principle as regards the confiding secrets to ladies  because from the beginning of the world it has become notorious how well they keep them and with what admirable discretion  tact  and forethought this fairest portion of humanity conduct themselves we know how few mrs  chillingworths there are in the world  and have but to regret that our friend the doctor should  in his matrimonial adventure  have met with such a specimen chapter xl the popular riot sir francis varney s danger the suggestion and its results illustration such  then  were the circumstances which at once altered the whole aspect of the affairs  and  from private and domestic causes of very deep annoyance  led to public results of a character which seemed likely to involve the whole country side in the greatest possible confusion but while we blame mr  chillingworth for being so indiscreet as to communicate the secret of such a person as varney the vampyre to his wife  we trust in a short time to be enabled to show that he made as much reparation as it was possible to make for the mischief he had unintentionally committed  and now as he struggled onward apparently onward first and foremost among the rioters  he was really doing all in his power to quell that tumult which superstition and dread had raised human nature truly delights in the marvellous  and in proportion as a knowledge of the natural phenomena of nature is restricted  and unbridled imagination allowed to give the rein to fathomless conjecture we shall find an eagerness likewise to believe the marvellous to be the truth that dim and uncertain condition concerning vampyres  originating probably as it had done in germany  had spread itself slowly  but insidiously  throughout the whole of the civilized world in no country and in no clime is there not something which bears a kind of family relationship to the veritable vampyre of which sir francis varney appeared to be so choice a specimen the ghoul  of eastern nations is but the same being  altered to suit habits and localities  and the sema  of the scandinavians is but the vampyre of a more primitive race  and a personification of that morbid imagination which has once fancied the probability of the dead walking again among the living  with all the frightful insignia of corruption and the grave about them although not popular in england  still there had been tales told of such midnight visitants  so that mrs  chillingworth  when she had imparted the information which she had obtained  had already some rough material to work upon in the minds of her auditors  and therefore there was no great difficulty in very soon establishing the fact under such circumstances  ignorant people always do what they have heard has been done by some one else before them and in an incredibly short space of time the propriety of catching sir francis varney  depriving him of his vampyre like existence  and driving a stake through his body became not at all a questionable proposition alas  poor mr  chillingworth  as well might he have attempted king canute s task of stemming the waves of the ocean as that of attempting to stop the crowd from proceeding to sir francis varney s house his very presence was a sort of confirmation of the whole affair  in vain he gesticulated  in vain he begged and prayed that they would go back  and in vain he declared that full and ample justice should be done upon the vampyre  provided popular clamour spared him  and he was left to more deliberate judgment those who were foremost in the throng paid no attention to these remonstrances while those who were more distant heard them not  and  for all they knew  he might be urging the crowd on to violence  instead of deprecating it thus  then  this disorderly rabble soon reached the house of sir francis varney and loudly demanded of his terrified servant where he was to be found the knocking at the hall door was prodigious  and  with a laudable desire  doubtless  of saving time  the moment one was done amusing himself with the ponderous knocker  another seized it  so that until the door was flung open by some of the bewildered and terrified men  there was no cessation whatever of the furious demands for admittance varney the vampyre varney the vampyre  cried a hundred voices  death to the vampyre  where is he  bring him out  varney the vampyre the servants were too terrified to speak for some moments  as they saw such a tumultuous assemblage seeking their master  while so singular a name was applied to him  at length  one more bold than the rest contrived to stammer out my good people  sir francis varney is not at home  he took an early breakfast  and has been out nearly an hour the mob paused a moment in indecision  and then one of the foremost cried who d suppose they d own he was at home  he s hiding somewhere of course  let s pull him out ah  pull him out pull him out  cried many voices  a rush was made into the hall and in a very few minutes its chambers were ransacked  and all its hidden places carefully searched  with the hope of discovering the hidden form of sir francis varney the servants felt that  with their inefficient strength  to oppose the proceedings of an assemblage which seemed to be unchecked by all sort of law or reason  would be madness  they therefore only looked on  with wonder and dismay  satisfied certainly in their own minds that sir francis would not be found  and indulging in much conjecture as to what would be the result of such violent and unexpected proceedings mr  chillingworth hoped that time was being gained  and that some sort of indication of what was going on would reach the unhappy object of popular detestation sufficiently early to enable him to provide for his own safety he knew he was breaking his own engagement to be present at the duel between henry bannerworth and sir francis varney  and  as that thought recurred to him  he dreaded that his professional services might be required on one side or the other  for he knew  or fancied he knew  that mutual hatred dictated the contest  and he thought that if ever a duel had taken place which was likely to be attended with some disastrous result  that was surely the one but how could he leave  watched and surrounded as he was by an infuriated multitude how could he hope but that his footsteps would be dogged  or that the slightest attempt of his to convey a warning to sir francis varney  would not be the means of bringing down upon his head the very danger he sought to shield him from in this state of uncertainty  then  did our medical man remain  a prey to the bitterest reflections  and full of the direst apprehensions without having the slightest power of himself to alter so disastrous a train of circumstances dissatisfied with their non success  the crowd twice searched the house of sir francis varney  from the attics to the basement  and then  and not till then  did they begin reluctantly to believe that the servants must have spoken the truth he s in the town somewhere  cried one  let s go back to the town it is strange how suddenly any mob will obey any impulse  and this perfectly groundless supposition was sufficient to turn their steps back again in the direction whence they came  and they had actually  in a straggling sort of column  reached halfway towards the town  when they encountered a boy  whose professional pursuit consisted in tending sheep very early of a morning  and who at once informed them that he had seen sir francis varney in the wood  half way between bannerworth hall and his own home this event at once turned the whole tide again  and with renewed clamours  carrying mr  chillingworth along with them  they now rapidly neared the real spot  where  probably  had they turned a little earlier they would have viewed the object of their suspicion and hatred but  as we have already recorded  the advancing throng was seen by the parties on the ground  where the duel could scarcely have been said to have been fought  and then had sir francis varney dashed into the wood which was so opportunely at hand to afford him a shelter from his enemies  and from the intricacies of which well acquainted with them as he doubtless was he had every chance of eluding their pursuit the whole affair was a great surprise to henry and his friends  when they saw such a string of people advancing  with such shouts and imprecations  they could not  for the life of them  imagine what could have excited such a turn out among the ordinarily industrious and quiet inhabitants of a town  remarkable rather for the quietude and steadiness of its population  than for any violent outbreaks of popular feeling what can mr  chillingworth be about  said henry  to bring such a mob here  has he taken leave of his senses nay  said marchdale  look again  he seems to be trying to keep them back  although ineffectually  for they will not be stayed d e  said the admiral  here s a gang of pirates  we shall be boarded and carried before we know where we are  jack ay ay  sir  said jack and is that all you ve got to say  you lubber  when you see your admiral in danger  you d better go and make terms with the enemy at once really  this is serious  said henry  they shout for varney  can mr chillingworth have been so mad as to adopt this means of stopping the duel impossible  said marchdale  if that had been his intention  he could have done so quietly  through the medium of the civil authorities hang me  exclaimed the admiral  if there are any civil authorities they talk of smashing somebody  what do they say  jack  i don t hear quite so well as i used you always was a little deaf  said jack what a little deaf  i say why  you lubberly lying swab  how dare you say so because you was you slave going scoundrel for heaven s sake  do not quarrel at such a time as this  said henry we shall be surrounded in a moment  come  mr  marchdale  let you and i visit these people  and ascertain what it is that has so much excited their indignation agreed  said marchdale  and they both stepped forward at a rapid pace to meet the advancing throng the crowd which had now approached to within a short distance of the expectant little party  was of a most motley description  and its appearance  under many circumstances  would cause considerable risibility  men and women were mixed indiscriminately together  and in the shouting  the latter  if such a thing were possible  exceeded the former  both in discordance and energy every individual composing that mob carried some weapon calculated for defence  such as flails  scythes  sickles  bludgeons  c  and this mode of arming caused them to wear a most formidable appearance  while the passion that superstition had called up was strongly depicted in their inflamed features  their fury  too  had been excited by their disappointment  and it was with concentrated rage that they now pressed onward the calm and steady advance of henry and mr  marchdale to meet the advancing throng  seemed to have the effect of retarding their progress a little  and they came to a parley at a hedge  which separated them from the meadow in which the duel had been fought you seem to be advancing towards us  said henry  do you seek me or any of my friends  and if so  upon what errand  mr  chillingworth  for heaven s sake  explain what is the cause of all this assault  you seem to be at the head of it seem to be  said mr  chillingworth  without being so  you are not sought  nor any of your friends who  then sir francis varney  was the immediate reply indeed  and what has he done to excite popular indignation  of private wrong i can accuse him  but i desire no crowd to take up my cause  or to avenge my quarrels mr  bannerworth  it has become known  through my indiscretion  that sir francis varney is suspected of being a vampyre is this so hurrah  shouted the mob  down with the vampyre  hurrah  where is he down with him drive a stake through him  said a woman  it s the only way  and the humanest  you ve only to take a hedge stake and sharpen it a bit at one end  and char it a little in the fire so as there mayt n t be no splinters to hurt  and then poke it through his stomach the mob gave a great shout at this humane piece of advice  and it was some time before henry could make himself heard at all  even to those who were nearest to him when he did succeed in so doing  he cried  with a loud voice hear me  all of you  it is quite needless for me to inquire how you became possessed of the information that a dreadful suspicion hangs over the person of sir francis varney  but if  in consequence of hearing such news  you fancy this public demonstration will be agreeable to me  or likely to relieve those who are nearest or dearest to me from the state of misery and apprehension into which they have fallen  you are much mistaken hear him  hear him  cried mr  marchdale  he speaks both wisdom and truth if anything  pursued henry  could add to the annoyance of vexation and misery we have suffered  it would assuredly be the being made subjects of every day gossip  and every day clamour you hear him  said mr  marchdale yes  we does  said a man  but we comes out to catch a vampyre  for all that oh  to be sure  said the humane woman  nobody s feelings is nothing to us  are we to be woke up in the night with vampyres sucking our bloods while we ve got a stake in the country hurrah  shouted everybody  down with the vampyre  where is he you are wrong  i assure you  you are all wrong  said mr chillingworth  imploringly  there is no vampyre here  you see  sir francis varney has not only escaped  but he will take the law of all of you this was an argument which appeared to stagger a few  but the bolder spirits pushed them on  and a suggestion to search the wood having been made by some one who was more cunning than his neighbours  that measure was at once proceeded with  and executed in a systematic manner  which made those who knew it to be the hiding place of sir francis varney tremble for his safety it was with a strange mixture of feeling that henry bannerworth waited the result of the search for the man who but a few minutes before had been opposed to him in a contest of life or death the destruction of sir francis varney would certainly have been an effectual means of preventing him from continuing to be the incubus he then was upon the bannerworth family  and yet the generous nature of henry shrank with horror from seeing even such a creature as varney sacrificed at the shrine of popular resentment  and murdered by an infuriated populace he felt as great an interest in the escape of the vampyre as if some great advantage to himself had been contingent upon such an event  and although he spoke not a word  while the echoes of the little wood were all awakened by the clamorous manner in which the mob searched for their victim  his feelings could be well read upon his countenance the admiral  too  without possessing probably the fine feelings of henry bannerworth  took an unusually sympathetic interest in the fate of the vampyre  and  after placing himself in various attitudes of intense excitement  he exclaimed d n it  jack  i do hope  after all  the vampyre will get the better of them  it s like a whole flotilla attacking one vessel a lubberly proceeding at the best  and i ll be hanged if i like it  i should like to pour in a broadside into those fellows  just to let them see it wasn t a proper english mode of fighting  shouldn t you  jack ay  ay  sir  i should shiver me  if i see an opportunity  if i don t let some of those rascals know what s what scarcely had these words escaped the lips of the old admiral than there arose a loud shout from the interior of the wood  it was a shout of success  and seemed at the very least to herald the capture of the unfortunate varney by heaven  exclaimed henry  they have him god forbid  said mr  marchdale  this grows too serious bear a hand  jack  said the admiral  we ll have a fight for it yet they sha n t murder even a vampyre in cold blood  load the pistols and send a flying shot or two among the rascals  the moment they appear no  no  said henry  no more violence  at least there has been enough there has been enough even as he spoke there came rushing from among the trees  at the corner of the wood  the figure of a man  there needed but one glance to assure them who it was  sir francis varney had been seen  and was flying before those implacable foes who had sought his life he had divested himself of his huge cloak  as well as of his low slouched hat  and  with a speed which nothing but the most absolute desperation could have enabled him to exert  he rushed onward  beating down before him every obstacle  and bounding over the meadows at a rate that  if he could have continued it for any length of time  would have set pursuit at defiance bravo  shouted the admiral  a stern chase is a long chase  and i wish them joy of it d e  jack  did you ever see anybody get along like that ay  ay  sir you never did  you scoundrel yes  i did when and where when you ran away off the sound the admiral turned nearly blue with anger  but jack looked perfectly imperturbable  as he added you know you ran away after the french frigates who wouldn t stay to fight you ah  that indeed  there he goes  putting on every stitch of canvass i ll be bound and there they come  said jack  as he pointed to the corner of the wood  and some of the more active of the vampyre s pursuers showed themselves it would appear as if the vampyre had been started from some hiding place in the interior of the wood  and had then thought it expedient altogether to leave that retreat  and make his way to some more secure one across the open country  where there would be more obstacles to his discovery than perseverance could overcome  probably then  among the brushwood and trees  for a few moments he had been again lost sight of  until those who were closest upon his track had emerged from among the dense foliage  and saw him scouring across the country at such headlong speed  these were but few  and in their extreme anxiety themselves to capture varney  whose precipate and terrified flight brought a firm conviction to their minds of his being a vampyre  they did not stop to get much of a reinforcement  but plunged on like greyhounds in his track jack  said the admiral  this won t do  look at that great lubberly fellow with the queer smock frock never saw such a figure head in my life  said jack stop him ay  ay  sir the man was coming on at a prodigious rate  and jack  with all the deliberation in the world  advanced to meet him  and when they got sufficiently close together  that in a few moments they must encounter each other  jack made himself into as small a bundle as possible  and presented his shoulder to the advancing countryman in such a way  that he flew off it at a tangent  as if he had run against a brick wall  and after rolling head over heels for some distance  safely deposited himself in a ditch  where he disappeared completely for a few moments from all human observation don t say i hit you  said jack  curse yer  what did yer run against me for  sarves you right  lubbers as don t know how to steer  in course runs agin things bravo  said the admiral  there s another of them the pursuers of varney the vampyre  however  now came too thick and fast to be so easily disposed of  and as soon as his figure could be seen coursing over the meadows  and springing over road and ditch with an agility almost frightful to look upon  the whole rabble rout was in pursuit of him by this time  the man who had fallen into the ditch had succeeded in making his appearance in the visible world again  and as he crawled up the bank  looking a thing of mire and mud  jack walked up to him with all the carelessness in the world  and said to him any luck  old chap oh  murder  said the man  what do you mean  who are you  where am i what s the matter  old muster fowler  the fat crowner  will set upon me now have you caught anything  said jack caught anything yes  you ve been in for eels  haven t you d n well  it is odd to me  as some people can t go a fishing without getting out of temper  have it your own way  i won t interfere with you  and away jack walked the man cleared the mud out of his eyes  as well as he could  and looked after him with a powerful suspicion that in jack he saw the very cause of his mortal mishap  but  somehow or other  his immersion in the not over limpid stream had wonderfully cooled his courage  and casting one despairing look upon his begrimed apparel  and another at the last of the stragglers who were pursuing sir francis varney across the fields he thought it prudent to get home as fast he could  and get rid of the disagreeable results of an adventure which had turned out for him anything but auspicious or pleasant mr  chillingworth  as though by a sort of impulse to be present in case sir francis varney should really be run down and with a hope of saving him from personal violence  had followed the foremost of the rioters in the wood  found it now quite impossible for him to carry on such a chase as that which was being undertaken across the fields after sir francis varney his person was unfortunately but ill qualified for the continuance of such a pursuit  and  although with the greatest reluctance  he at last felt himself compelled to give it up in making his way through the intricacies of the wood  he had been seriously incommoded by the thick undergrowth  and he had accidentally encountered several miry pools  with which he had involuntarily made a closer acquaintance than was at all conducive either to his personal appearance or comfort  the doctor s temper  though  generally speaking one of the most even  was at last affected by his mishaps  and he could not restrain from an execration upon his want of prudence in letting his wife have a knowledge of a secret that was not his own  and the producing an unlooked for circumstance  the termination of which might be of a most disastrous nature tired  therefore  and nearly exhausted by the exertions he had already taken  he emerged now alone from the wood  and near the spot where stood henry bannerworth and his friends in consultation the jaded look of the surgeon was quite sufficient indication of the trouble and turmoil he had gone through  and some expressions of sympathy for his condition were dropped by henry  to whom he replied nay  my young friend  i deserve it all  i have nothing but my own indiscretion to thank for all the turmoil and tumult that has arisen this morning but to what possible cause can we attribute such an outrage reproach me as much as you will  i deserve it  a man may prate of his own secrets if he like  but he should be careful of those of other people  i trusted yours to another  and am properly punished enough  said henry  we ll say no more of that  mr  chillingworth what is done cannot be undone  and we had better spend our time in reflection of how to make the best of what is  than in useless lamentation over its causes  what is to be done nay  i know not  have you fought the duel yes  and  as you perceive  harmlessly thank heaven for that nay  i had my fire  which sir francis varney refused to return  so the affair had just ended  when the sound of approaching tumult came upon our ears illustration what a strange mixture  exclaimed marchdale  of feelings and passions this varney appears to be  at one moment acting with the apparent greatest malignity  and another  seeming to have awakened in his mind a romantic generosity which knows no bounds  i cannot understand him nor i  indeed  said henry  but yet i somehow tremble for his fate and i seem to feel that something ought to be done to save him from the fearful consequences of popular feeling  let us hasten to the town  and procure what assistance we may  but a few persons  well organised and properly armed  will achieve wonders against a desultory and ill appointed multitude  there may be a chance of saving him  yet  from the imminent danger which surrounds him that s proper  cried the admiral  i don t like to see anybody run down  a fair fight s another thing  yard arm and yard arm stink pots and pipkins broadside to broadside and throw in your bodies  if you like  on the lee quarter  but don t do anything shabby  what do you think of it  jack why  i means to say as how if varney only keeps on sail as he s been doing  that the devil himself wouldn t catch him in a gale and yet  said henry  it is our duty to do the best we can  let us at once to the town  and summons all the assistance in our power  come on come on his friends needed no further urging  but  at a brisk pace  they all proceeded by the nearest footpaths towards the town it puzzled his pursuers to think in what possible direction sir francis varney expected to find sustenance or succour  when they saw how curiously he took his flight across the meadows  instead of endeavouring  by any circuitous path  to seek the shelter of his own house  or to throw himself upon the care of the authorities of the town who must  to the extent of their power  have protected him  he struck across the fields  apparently without aim or purpose  seemingly intent upon nothing but to distance his pursuers in a long chase  which might possibly tire them  or it might not  according to their or his powers of endurance we say this seemed to be the case  but it was not so in reality  sir francis varney had a deeper purpose  and it was scarcely to be supposed that a man of his subtle genius  and  apparently  far seeing and reflecting intellect  could have so far overlooked the many dangers of his position as not to be fully prepared for some such contingency as that which had just now occurred holding  as he did  so strange a place in society living among men  and yet possessing so few attributes in common with humanity he must all along have felt the possibility of drawing upon himself popular violence he could not wholly rely upon the secrecy of the bannerworth family much as they might well be supposed to shrink from giving publicity to circumstances of so fearfully strange and perilous a nature as those which had occurred amongst them  the merest accident might  at any moment  make him the town s talk  the overhearing of a few chance words by some gossiping domestic some ebullition of anger or annoyance by some member of the family or a communication from some friend who had been treated with confidence might  at any time  awaken around him some such a storm as that which now raged at his heels varney the vampire must have calculated this  he must have felt the possibility of such a state of things  and  as a matter of course politicly provided himself with some place of refuge after about twenty minutes of hard chasing across the fields  there could be no doubt of his intentions  he had such a place of refuge  and strange a one as it might appear  he sped towards it in as direct a line as ever a well sped arrow flew towards its mark that place of refuge  to the surprise of every one  appeared to be the ancient ruin  of which we have before spoken  and which was so well known to every inhabitant of the county truly  it seemed like some act of mere desperation for sir francis varney to hope there to hide himself  there remained within  of what had once been a stately pile  but a few grey crumbling walls  which the hunted have would have passed unheeded  knowing that not for one instant could he have baffled his pursuers by seeking so inefficient a refuge and those who followed hard and fast upon the track of sir francis varney felt so sure of their game  when they saw whither he was speeding  that they relaxed in their haste considerably  calling loudly to each other that the vampire was caught at last  for he could be easily surrounded among the old ruins  and dragged from amongst its moss grown walls in another moment  with a wild dash and a cry of exultation  he sprang out of sight  behind an angle  formed by what had been at one time one of the principal supports of the ancient structure then  as if there was still something so dangerous about him  that only by a great number of hands could he be hoped to be secured  the infuriated peasantry gathered in a dense circle around what they considered his temporary place of refuge  and as the sun  which had now climbed above the tree tops  and dispersed  in a great measure  many of the heavy clouds of morning  shone down upon the excited group  they might have been supposed there assembled to perform some superstitious rite  which time had hallowed as an association of the crumbling ruin around which they stood by the time the whole of the stragglers  who had persisted in the chase had come up  there might have been about fifty or sixty resolute men each intent upon securing the person of one whom they felt  while in existence  would continue to be a terror to all the weaker and dearer portions of their domestic circles there was a pause of several minutes  those who had come the fleetest were gathering breath  and those who had come up last were looking to their more forward companions for some information as to what had occurred before their arrival all was profoundly still within the ruin  and then suddenly  as if by common consent  there arose from every throat a loud shout of down with the vampyre  down with the vampyre the echoes of that shout died away  and then all was still as before while a superstitious feeling crept over even the boldest  it would almost seem as if they had expected some kind of response from sir francis varney to the shout of defiance with which they had just greeted him  but the very calmness  repose  and absolute quiet of the ruin  and all about it  alarmed them  and they looked the one at the other as if the adventure after all were not one of the pleasantest description  and might not fall out so happily as they had expected yet what danger could there be  there were they  more than half a hundred stout  strong men  to cope with one  they felt convinced that he was completely in their power  they knew the ruins could not hide him and that five minutes time given to the task  would suffice to explore every nook and corner of them and yet they hesitated  while an unknown terror shook their nerves  and seemingly from the very fact that they had run down their game successfully  they dreaded to secure the trophy of the chase one bold spirit was wanting  and  if it was not a bold one that spoke at length  he might be complimented as being comparatively such  it was one who had not been foremost in the chase  perchance from want of physical power  who now stood forward  and exclaimed what are you waiting for  now  you can have him when you like  if you want your wives and children to sleep quietly in their beds  you will secure the vampyre  come on we all know he s here why do you hesitate do you expect me to go alone and drag him out by the ears any voice would have sufficed to break the spell which bound them  this did so  and  with one accord  and yells of imprecation  they rushed forward and plunged among the old walls of the ruin less time than we have before remarked would have enabled any one to explore the tottering fabric sufficient to bring a conviction to their minds that  after all  there might have been some mistake about the matter  and sir francis varney was not quite caught yet it was astonishing how the fact of not finding him in a moment  again roused all their angry feelings against him  and dispelled every feeling of superstitious awe with which he had been surrounded  rage gave place to the sort of shuddering horror with which they had before contemplated his immediate destruction  when they had believed him to be virtually within their very grasp over and over again the ruins were searched hastily and impatiently by some  carefully and deliberately by others  until there could be no doubt upon the mind of every one individual  that somehow or somewhere within the shadow of those walls  sir francis varney had disappeared most mysteriously then it would have been a strange sight for any indifferent spectator to have seen how they shrunk  one by one  out of the shadow of those ruins each seeming to be afraid that the vampyre  in some mysterious manner would catch him if he happened to be the last within their sombre influence  and  when they had all collected in the bright  open space some little distance beyond  they looked at each other and at the ruins with dubious expressions of countenance  each  no doubt  wishing that each would suggest something of a consolatory or practicable character what s to be done  now  said one ah  that s it  said another  sententiously  i ll be hanged if i know he s given us the slip  remarked a third but he can t have given us the slip  said one man  who was particularly famous for a dogmatical spirit of argumentation  how is it possible  he must be here  and i say he is here find him  then  cried several at once oh  that s nothing to do with the argument  he s here  whether we find him or not one very cunning fellow laid his finger on his nose  and beckoned to a comrade to retire some paces  where he delivered himself of the following very oracular sentiment my good friend  you must know sir francis varney is here or he isn t agreed  agreed well  if he isn t here it s no use troubling our heads any more about him  but  otherwise  it s quite another thing  and  upon the whole  i must say  that i rather think he is all looked at him  for it was evident he was big with some suggestion after a pause  he resumed now  my good friends  i propose that we all appear to give it up  and to go away  but that some one of us shall remain and hide among the ruins for some time  to watch  in case the vampyre makes his appearance from some hole or corner that we haven t found out oh  capital  said everybody then you all agree to that yes  yes very good  that s the only way to nick him  now  we ll pretend to give it up  let s all of us talk loud about going home they did all talk loud about going home  they swore that it was not worth the trouble of catching him  that they gave it up as a bad job that he might go to the deuce in any way he liked  for all they cared and then they all walked off in a body  when  the man who had made the suggestion  suddenly cried hilloa  hilloa stop  stop  you know one of us is to wait oh  ay  yes  yes  yes  said everybody  and still they moved on but really  you know  what s the use of this  who s to wait that was  indeed  a knotty question  which induced a serious consultation  ending in their all  with one accord  pitching upon the author of the suggestion  as by far the best person to hide in the ruins and catch the vampyre they then all set off at full speed  but the cunning fellow  who certainly had not the slightest idea of so practically carrying out his own suggestion  scampered off after them with a speed that soon brought him in the midst of the throng again  and so  with fear in their looks and all the evidences of fatigue about them  they reached the town to spread fresh and more exaggerated accounts of the mysterious conduct of varney the vampyre chapter xliv varney s danger  and his rescue the prisoner again  and the subterranean vault illustration we have before slightly mentioned to the reader  and not unadvisedly the existence of a certain prisoner  confined in a gloomy dungeon  into whose sad and blackened recesses but few and faint glimmering rays of light ever penetrated  for  by a diabolical ingenuity  the narrow loophole which served for a window to that subterraneous abode was so constructed  that  let the sun be at what point it might  during its diurnal course  but a few reflected beams of light could ever find their way into that abode of sorrow the prisoner the same prisoner of whom we before spoke is there despair is in his looks  and his temples are still bound with those cloths  which seemed now for many days to have been sopped in blood which has become encrusted in their folds he still lives  apparently incapable of movement  how he has lived so long seems to be a mystery  for one would think him scarcely in a state even were nourishment placed to his lips  to enable him to swallow it it may be  however  that the mind has as much to do with that apparent absolute prostration of all sort of physical energy as those bodily wounds which he has received at the hands of the enemies who have reduced him to his present painful and hopeless situation occasionally a low groan burst from his lips  it seems to come from the very bottom of his heart  and it sounds as if it would carry with it every remnant of vitality that was yet remaining to him then he moves restlessly  and repeats in hurried accents the names of some who are dear to him  and far away some who may  perchance  be mourning him  but who know not  guess not  aught of his present sufferings as he thus moves  the rustle of a chain among the straw on which he lies gives an indication  that even in that dungeon it has not been considered prudent to leave him master of his own actions  lest  by too vigorous an effort  he might escape from the thraldom in which he is held the sound reaches his own ears  and for a few moments  in the deep impatience of his wounded spirit  he heaps malediction on the heads of those who have reduced him to his present state but soon a better nature seems to come over him  and gentler words fall from his lips  he preaches patience to himself he talks not of revenge but of justice  and in accents of more hopefulness than he had before spoken  he calls upon heaven to succour him in his deep distress then all is still  and the prisoner appears to have resigned himself once more to the calmness of expectation or of despair  but hark  his sense of hearing  rendered doubly acute by lying so long alone in nearly darkness  and in positive silence  detects sounds which  to ordinary mortal powers of perception  would have been by far too indistinct to produce any tangible effect upon the senses it is the sound of feet on  on they come  far overhead he hears them they beat the green earth that sweet  verdant sod  which he may never see again with an impatient tread  nearer and nearer still  and now they pause  he listens with all the intensity of one who listens for existence  some one comes  there is a lumbering noise a hasty footstep he hears some one labouring for breath panting like a hunted hare  his dungeon door is opened  and there totters in a man  tall and gaunt  he reels like one intoxicated  fatigue has done more than the work of inebriation  he cannot save himself  and he sinks exhausted by the side of that lonely prisoner the captive raises himself as far as his chains will allow him  he clutches the throat of his enervated visitor villain  monster  vampyre  he shrieks  i have thee now  and locked in a deadly embrace  they roll upon the damp earth  struggling for life together                                    it is mid day at bannerworth hall  and flora is looking from the casement anxiously expecting the arrival of her brothers  she had seen from some of the topmost windows of the hall  that the whole neighbourhood had been in a state of commotion  but little did she guess the cause of so much tumult  or that it in any way concerned her she had seen the peasantry forsaking their work in the fields and the gardens  and apparently intent upon some object of absorbing interest but she feared to leave the house  for she had promised henry that she would not do so  lest the former pacific conduct of the vampyre should have been but a new snare  for the purpose of drawing her so far from her home as to lead her into some danger when she should be far from assistance and yet more than once was she tempted to forget her promise  and to seek the open country  for fear that those she loved should be encountering some danger for her sake  which she would willingly either share with them or spare them the solicitation  however  of her brother kept her comparatively quiet and  moreover  since her last interview with varney  in which  at all events  he had shown some feeling for the melancholy situation to which he had reduced her  she had been more able to reason calmly  and to meet the suggestions of passion and of impulse with a sober judgment about midday  then  she saw the domestic party returning that party which now consisted of her two brothers  the admiral  jack pringle  and mr  chillingworth  as for mr  marchdale  he had given them a polite adieu on the confines of the grounds of bannerworth hall  stating  that although he had felt it to be his duty to come forward and second henry bannerworth in the duel with the vampyre  yet that circumstance by no means obliterated from his memory the insults he had received from admiral bell  and  therefore  he declined going to bannerworth hall  and bade them a very good morning to all this  admiral bell replied that he might go and be d d  if he liked  and that he considered him a swab and a humbug  and appealed to jack pringle whether he  jack  ever saw such a sanctified looking prig in his life ay  ay  says jack this answer  of course  produced the usual contention  which lasted them until they got fairly in the house  where they swore at each other to an extent that was enough to make any one s hair stand on end  until henry and mr  chillingworth interfered  and really begged that they would postpone the discussion until some more fitting opportunity the whole of the circumstances were then related to flora  who  while she blamed her brother much for fighting the duel with the vampyre found in the conduct of that mysterious individual  as regarded the encounter  yet another reason for believing him to be strictly sincere in his desire to save her from the consequences of his future visits her desire to leave bannerworth hall consequently became more and more intense  and as the admiral really now considered himself the master of the house  they offered no amount of opposition to the subject  but merely said my dear flora  admiral bell shall decide in all these matters  now  we know that he is our sincere friend  and that whatever he says we ought to do  will be dictated by the best possible feelings towards us then i appeal to you  sir  said flora  turning to the admiral very good  replied the old man  then i say nay  admiral  interrupted mr  chillingworth  you promised me  but a short time since  that you would come to no decision whatever upon this question  until you had heard some particulars which i have to relate to you  which  in my humble opinion  will sway your judgment and so i did  cried the admiral  but i had forgotten all about it flora  my dear  i ll be with you in an hour or two  my friend  the doctor  here  has got some sow by the ear  and fancies it s the right one  however  i ll hear what he has got to say  first  before we come to a conclusion  so  come along  mr  chillingworth  and let s have it out at once flora  said henry  when the admiral had left the room  i can see that you wish to leave the hall i do  brother  but not to go far i wish rather to hide from varney than to make myself inaccessible by distance you still cling to this neighbourhood i do  i do  and you know with what hope i cling to it perfectly  you still think it possible that charles holland may be united to you i do  i do you believe his faith oh  yes  as i believe in heaven s mercy and i  flora  i would not doubt him now for worlds  something even now seems to whisper to me that a brighter sun of happiness will yet dawn upon us  and that  when the mists which at present enshroud ourselves and our fortunes pass away  they will disclose a landscape full of beauty  the future of which shall know no pangs yes  brother  exclaimed flora  enthusiastically  this  after all  may be but some trial  grievous while it lasts  but yet tending eventually only to make the future look more bright and beautiful  heaven may yet have in store for us all some great happiness  which shall spring clearly and decidedly from out these misfortunes be it so  and may we ever thus banish despair by such hopeful propositions  lean on my arm  flora  you are safe with me  come dearest  and taste the sweetness of the morning air there was  indeed now  a hopefulness about the manner in which henry bannerworth spoke  such as flora had not for some weary months had the pleasure of listening to  and she eagerly rose to accompany him into the garden  which was glowing with all the beauty of sunshine  for the day had turned out to be much finer than the early morning had at all promised it would be flora  he said  when they had taken some turns to and fro in the garden  notwithstanding all that has happened  there is no convincing mr  chillingworth that sir francis varney is really what to us he appears indeed it is so  in the face of all evidence  he neither will believe in vampyres at all  nor that varney is anything but some mortal man  like ourselves  in his thoughts  talents  feelings  and modes of life  and with no more power to do any one an injury than we have oh  would that i could think so and i  but  unhappily  we have by far too many  and too conclusive evidences to the contrary we have  indeed  brother and though  while we respect that strength of mind in our friend which will not allow him  even almost at the last extremity  to yield to what appear to be stern facts  we may not ourselves be so obdurate  but may feel that we know enough to be convinced you have no doubt  brother most reluctantly  i must confess  that i feel compelled to consider varney as something more than mortal he must be so and now  sister  before we leave the place which has been a home to us from earliest life  let us for a few moments consider if there be any possible excuse for the notion of mr  chillingworth  to the effect that sir francis varney wants possession of the house for some purpose still more inimical to our peace and prosperity than any he has yet attempted has he such an opinion he has tis very strange yes  flora  he seems to gather from all the circumstances  nothing but an overwhelming desire on the part of sir francis varney to become the tenant of bannerworth hall he certainly wishes to possess it yes  but can you  sister  in the exercise of any possible amount of fancy  imagine any motive for such an anxiety beyond what he alleges which is merely that he is fond of old houses precisely so  that is the reason  and the only one  that can be got from him  heaven only knows if it be the true one it may be  brother as you say  it may  but there s a doubt  nevertheless  flora  i much rejoice that you have had an interview with this mysterious being  for you have certainty  since that time  been happier and more composed than i ever hoped to see you again i have indeed it is sufficiently perceivable somehow  brother  since that interview  i have not had the same sort of dread of sir francis varney which before made the very sound of his name a note of terror to me  his words  and all he said to me during that interview which took place so strangely between us  indeed how i know not  tended altogether rather to make him  to a certain extent  an object of my sympathies rather than my abhorrence that is very strange i own that it is strange  henry  but when we come for but a brief moment to reflect upon the circumstances which have occurred  we shall i think  be able to find some cause even to pity varney the vampyre how thus  brother  it is said and well may i who have been subject to an attack of such a nature  tremble to repeat the saying that those who have been once subject to the visitations of a vampyre  are themselves in a way to become one of the dreadful and maddening fraternity i have heard so much  sister  replied henry yes  and therefore who knows but that sir francis varney may  at one time  have been as innocent as we are ourselves of the terrible and fiendish propensity which now makes him a terror and a reproach to all who know him  or are in any way obnoxious to his attacks that is true there may have been a time who shall say there was not when he  like me  would have shrunk  with a dread as great as any one could have experienced  from the contamination of the touch even of a vampyre i cannot  sister  deny the soundness of your reasoning  said henry with a sigh  but i still no not see anything  even from a full conviction that varney is unfortunate  which should induce us to tolerate him nay  brother  i said not tolerate  what i mean is  that even with the horror and dread we must naturally feel at such a being  we may afford to mingle some amount of pity  which shall make us rather seek to shun him  than to cross his path with a resolution of doing him an injury i perceive well  sister  what you mean  rather than remain here  and make an attempt to defy sir francis varney  you would fly from him  and leave him undisputed master of the field i would i would heaven forbid that i or any one should thwart you  you know well flora  how dear you are to me  you know well that your happiness has ever been to us all a matter which has assumed the most important of shapes  as regarded our general domestic policy  it is not  therefore likely now  dear sister  that we should thwart you in your wish to remove from here i know  henry  all you would say  remarked flora  as a tear started to her eyes  i know well all you think  and  in your love for me  i likewise know well i rely for ever  you are attached to this place  as indeed  we all are  by a thousand happy and pleasant associations  but listen to me further  henry  i do not wish to wander far not far  flora no  do i not still cling to a hope that charles may yet appear  and if he do so  it will assuredly be in this neighbourhood  which he knows is native and most dear to us all true then do i wish to make some sort of parade  in the way of publicity  of our leaving the hall yes  yes and yet not go far  in the neighbouring town  for example  surely we might find some means of living entirely free from remark or observation as to who or what we were that  sister  i doubt  if you seek for that species of solitude which you contemplate  it is only to be found in a desert a desert yes  or in a large city indeed ay  flora  you may well believe me  that it is so  in a small community you can have no possible chance of evading an amount of scrutiny which would very soon pierce through any disguise you could by any possibility assume then there is no resource  we must go far nay  i will consider for you  flora  and although  as a general principle  what i have said i know to be true  yet some more special circumstance may arise that may point a course that  while it enables us  for charles holland s sake  to remain in this immediate neighbourhood  yet will procure to us all the secrecy we may desire dear dear brother  said flora  as she flung herself upon henry s neck  you speak cheeringly to me  and  what is more  you believe in charles s faithfulness and truth as heaven is my judge  i do a thousand  thousand thanks for such an assurance  i know him too well to doubt  for one moment  his faith  oh  brother  could he could charles holland  the soul of honour  the abode of every noble impulse that can adorn humanity could he have written those letters  no  no perish the thought it has perished thank god i only  upon reflection  wonder how  misled for the moment by the concurrence of a number of circumstances  i could ever have suspected him it is like your generous nature  brother to say so  but you know as well as i  that there has been one here who has  far from feeling any sort of anxiety to think as well as possible of poor charles holland has done all that in him lay to take the worst view of his mysterious disappearance  and induce us to do the like you allude to mr  marchdale i do well  flora  at the same time that i must admit you have cause for speaking of mr  marchdale as you do  yet when we come to consider all things  there may be found for him excuses may there yes  flora  he is a man  as he himself says  past the meridian of life and the world is a sad as well as a bad teacher  for it soon too soon alas  deprives us of our trusting confidence in human nature it may be so  but yet  he  knowing as he did so very little of charles holland  judged him hastily and harshly you rather ought to say  flora  that he did not judge him generously well  be it so and you must recollect  when you say so  that marchdale did not love charles holland nay  now  said flora  while there flashed across her cheek  for a moment  a heightened colour  you are commencing to jest with me  and therefore  we will say no more  you know  dear henry  all my hopes  my wishes  and my feelings  and i shall therefore leave my future destiny in your hands  to dispose of as you please  look yonder where there  do you not see the admiral and mr  chillingworth walking among the trees yes  yes  i do now how very serious and intent they are upon the subject of their discourse  they seem quite lost to all surrounding objects  i could not have imagined any subject that would so completely have absorbed the attention of admiral bell mr  chillingworth had something to relate to him or to propose  of a nature which  perchance  has had the effect of enchaining all his attention he called him from the room yes  i saw that he did  but see  they come towards us  and now we shall  probably  hear what is the subject matter of their discourse and consultation we shall admiral bell had evidently seen henry and his sister  for now  suddenly as if not from having for the first moment observed them  and  in consequence  broken off their private discourse  but as if they arrived at some point in it which enabled them to come to a conclusion to be communicative  the admiral came towards the brother and sister well  said the bluff old admiral  when they were sufficiently near to exchange words  well  miss flora  you are looking a thousand times better than you were i thank you  admiral  i am much better oh  to be sure you are  and you will be much better still  and no sort of mistake  now  here s the doctor and i have both been agreeing upon what is best for you indeed yes  to be sure  have we not  doctor we have  admiral good  and what  now  miss flora  do you suppose it is i really cannot say why  it s change of air  to be sure  you must get away from here as quickly as you can  or there will be no peace for you yes  added mr  chillingworth  advancing  i am quite convinced that change of scene and change of place  and habits  and people  will tend more to your complete recovery than any other circumstances  in the most ordinary cases of indisposition we always find that the invalid recovers much sooner away from the scene of his indisposition  than by remaining in it  even though its general salubrity be much greater than the place to which he may be removed good  said the admiral then we are to understand  said henry  with a smile  that we are no longer to be your guests  admiral bell belay there  cried the admiral  who told you to understand any such thing  i should like to know well  but we shall look upon this house as yours  now  and  that being the case  if we remove from it  of course we cease to be your guests any longer that s all you know about it  now  hark ye  you don t command the fleet  so don t pretend to know what the admiral is going to do  i have made money by knocking about some of the enemies of old england  and that s the most gratifying manner in the world of making money  so far as i am concerned illustration it is an honourable mode of course it is  well  i am going to what the deuce do you call it what that s just what i want to know  oh  i have it now  i am going to what the lawyers call invest it a prudent step  admiral  and one which it is to be hoped  before now has occurred to you perhaps it has and perhaps it hasn t  however  that s my business  and no one s else s  i am going to invest my spare cash in taking houses so  as i don t care a straw where the houses may be situated  you can look out for one somewhere that will suit you  and i ll take it  so after all  you will be my guests there just the same as you are here admiral  said henry  it would be imposing upon a generosity as rare as it is noble  were we to allow you to do so much for us as you contemplate very good we cannot we dare not but i say you shall  so you have had your say  and i ve had mine  after which  if you please  master henry bannerworth  i shall take upon myself to consider the affair as altogether settled  you can commence operations as soon as you like  i know that miss flora  here bless her sweet eyes don t want to stay at bannerworth hall any longer than she can help it indeed i was urging upon henry to remove  said flora  but yet i cannot help feeling with him  admiral  that we are imposing upon your goodness go on imposing  then but psha  can t a man be imposed upon if he likes  d n it  that s a poor privilege for an englishman to be forced to make a row about  i tell you i like it  i will be imposed upon  so there s an end of that  and now let s come in and see what mrs  bannerworth has got ready for luncheon                                    it can hardly be supposed that such a popular ferment as had been created in the country town  by the singular reports concerning varney the vampyre  should readily  and without abundant satisfaction  subside an idea like that which had lent so powerful an impulse to the popular mind  was one far easier to set going than to deprecate or extinguish the very circumstances which had occurred to foil the excited mob in their pursuit of sir francis varney  were of a nature to increase the popular superstition concerning him  and to make him and his acts appear in still more dreadful colours mobs do not reason very closely and clearly  but the very fact of the frantic flight of sir francis varney from the projected attack of the infuriated multitude  was seized hold of as proof positive of the reality of his vampyre like existence then  again  had he not disappeared in the most mysterious manner  had he not sought refuge where no human being would think of seeking refuge namely  in that old  dilapidated ruin  where  when his pursuers were so close upon his track  he had succeeded in eluding their grasp with a facility which looked as if he had vanished into thin air  or as if the very earth had opened to receive him bodily within its cold embraces it is not to be wondered at  that the few who fled so precipitately from the ruin  lost nothing of the wonderful story they had to tell  in the carrying it from that place to the town  when they reached their neighbours  they not only told what had really occurred  but they added to it all their own surmises  and the fanciful creation of all their own fears  so that before mid day  and about the time when henry bannerworth was conversing so quietly in the gardens of the hall with his beautiful sister  there was an amount of popular ferment in the town  of which they had no conception all business was suspended  and many persons  now that once the idea had been started concerning the possibility that a vampyre might have been visiting some of the houses in the place  told how  in the dead of the night  they had heard strange noises  how children had shrieked from no apparent cause doors opened and shut without human agency  and windows rattled that never had been known to rattle before some  too  went so far as to declare that they had been awakened out of their sleep by noises incidental to an effort made to enter their chambers  and others had seen dusky forms of gigantic proportions outside their windows  tampering with their fastenings  and only disappearing when the light of day mocked all attempts at concealment these tales flew from mouth to mouth  and all listened to them with such an eager interest  that none thought it worth while to challenge their inconsistencies  or to express a doubt of their truth  because they had not been mentioned before the only individual  and he was a remarkably clever man  who made the slightest remark upon the subject of a practical character  hazarded a suggestion that made confusion worse confounded he knew something of vampyres  he had travelled abroad  and had heard of them in germany  as well as in the east  and  to a crowd of wondering and aghast listeners  he said you may depend upon it  my friends  this has been going on for some time  there have been several mysterious and sudden deaths in the town lately  people have wasted away and died nobody knew how or wherefore yes yes  said everybody there was miles  the butcher  you know how fat he was  and then how fat he wasn t a general assent was given to the proposition  and then  elevating one arm in an oratorical manner  the clever fellow continued i have not a doubt that miles  the butcher  and every one else who has died suddenly lately  have been victims of the vampyre  and what s more they ll all be vampyres  and come and suck other people s blood  till at last the whole town will be a town of vampyres but what s to be done  cried one  who trembled so excessively that he could scarcely stand under his apprehension there is but one plan sir francis varney must be found  and put out of the world in such a manner that he can t come back to it again  and all those who are dead that we have any suspicion of  should be taken up out of their graves and looked at  to see if they re rotting or not  if they are it s all right  but  if they look fresh and much  as usual  you may depend they re vampyres  and no mistake this was a terrific suggestion thrown amongst a mob  to have caught sir francis varney and immolated him at the shrine of popular fury  they would not have shrunk from  but a desecration of the graves of those whom they had known in life was a matter which  however much it had to recommend it  even the boldest stood aghast at  and felt some qualms of irresolution there are many ideas  however  which  like the first plunge into a cold bath  are rather uncomfortable for the moment  but which  in a little time  we become so familiarized with  that they become stripped of their disagreeable concomitants  and appear quite pleasing and natural so it was with this notion of exhuming the dead bodies of those townspeople who had recently died from what was called a decay of nature  and such other failures of vitality as bore not the tangible name of any understood disease from mouth to mouth the awful suggestion spread like wildfire  until at last it grew into such a shape that it almost seemed to become a duty at all events  to have up miles the butcher  and see how he looked there is  too  about human nature a natural craving curiosity concerning everything connected with the dead  there is not a man of education or of intellectual endowment who would not travel many miles to look upon the exhumation of the remains of some one famous in his time  whether for his vices  his virtues  his knowledge  his talents  or his heroism and  if this feeling exist in the minds of the educated and refined in a sublimated shape  which lends to it grace and dignity  we may look for it among the vulgar and the ignorant  taking only a grosser and meaner form  in accordance with their habits of thought  the rude materials  of which the highest and noblest feelings of educated minds are formed will be found amongst the most grovelling and base  and so this vulgar curiosity  which  combined with other feelings  prompted an ignorant and illiterate mob to exhume miles  the once fat butcher  in a different form tempted the philosophic hamlet to moralise upon the skull of yorick and it was wonderful to see how  when these people had made up their minds to carry out the singularly interesting  but  at the same fearful  suggestion  they assumed to themselves a great virtue in so doing told each other what an absolute necessity there was  for the public good  that it should be done  and then  with loud shouts and cries concerning the vampyre  they proceeded in a body to the village churchyard  where had been lain  with a hope of reposing in peace  the bones of their ancestors a species of savage ferocity now appeared to have seized upon the crowd and the people  in making up their minds to do something which was strikingly at variance with all their preconceived notions of right and wrong  appeared to feel that it was necessary  in order that they might be consistent  to cast off many of the decencies of life  and to become riotous and reckless as they proceeded towards the graveyard  they amused themselves by breaking the windows of the tax gatherers  and doing what passing mischief they could to the habitations of all who held any official situation or authority this was something like a proclamation of war against those who might think it their duty to interfere with the lawless proceedings of an ignorant multitude  a public house or two  likewise  en route  was sacked of some of its inebriating contents  so that  what with the madness of intoxication  and the general excitement consequent upon the very nature of the business which took them to the churchyard  a more wild and infuriated multitude than that which paused at two iron gates which led into the sanctuary of that church could not be imagined those who have never seen a mob placed in such a situation as to have cast off all moral restraint whatever  at the same time that it feels there is no physical power to cope with it  can form no notion of the mass of terrible passions which lie slumbering under what  in ordinary cases  have appeared harmless bosoms  but which now run riot  and overcame every principle of restraint  it is a melancholy fact  but nevertheless  a fact  despite its melancholy  that  even in a civilised country like this  with a generally well educated population  nothing but a well organised physical force keeps down  from the commission of the most outrageous offences  hundreds and thousands of persons we have said that the mob paused at the iron gates of the churchyard but it was more a pause of surprise than one of vacillation  because they saw that those iron gates were closed  which had not been the case within the memory of the oldest among them at the first building of the church  and the enclosure of its graveyard two pairs of these massive gates had been presented by some munificent patron  but  after a time  they hung idly upon their hinges  ornamental certainly  but useless  while a couple of turnstiles  to keep cattle from straying within the sacred precincts  did duty instead  and established  without trouble  the regular thoroughfare  which long habit had dictated as necessary  through the place of sepulture but now those gates were closed  and for once were doing duty  heaven only knows how they had been moved upon their rusty and time worn hinges  the mob  however  was checked for the moment  and it was clear that the ecclesiastical authorities were resolved to attempt something to prevent the desecration of the tombs those gates were sufficiently strong to resist the first vigorous shake which was given to them by some of the foremost among the crowd  and then one fellow started the idea that they might be opened from the inside  and volunteered to clamber over the wall to do so hoisted up upon the shoulders of several  he grasped the top of the wall  and raised his head above its level  and then something of a mysterious nature rose up from the inside  and dealt him such a whack between the eyes  that down he went sprawling among his coadjutors now  nobody had seen how this injury had been inflicted  and the policy of those in the garrison should have been certainly to keep up the mystery  and leave the invaders in ignorance of what sort of person it was that had so foiled them  man  however  is prone to indulge in vain glorification  and the secret was exploded by the triumphant waving of the long staff of the beadle  with the gilt knob at the end of it  just over the parapet of the wall  in token of victory it s waggles  it s waggles  cried everybody it s waggles  the beadle yes  said a voice from within  it s waggles  the beadle  and he thinks as he had yer there rather  try it again  the church isn t in danger  oh  no  what do you think of this the staff was flourished more vigorously than ever  and in the secure position that waggles occupied it seemed not only impossible to attack him  but that he possessed wonderful powers of resistance  for the staff was long and the knob was heavy it was a boy who hit upon the ingenious expedient of throwing up a great stone  so that it just fell inside the wall  and hit waggles a great blow on the head the staff was flourished more vigorously than ever  and the mob  in the ecstasy at the fun which was going on  almost forgot the errand which had brought them perhaps after all the affair might have passed off jestingly  had not there been some really mischievous persons among the throng who were determined that such should not be the case  and they incited the multitude to commence an attack upon the gates  which in a few moments must have produced their entire demolition suddenly  however  the boldest drew back  and there was a pause  as the well known form of the clergyman appeared advancing from the church door  attired in full canonicals there s mr  leigh  said several  how unlucky he should be here what is this  said the clergyman  approaching the gates  can i believe my eyes when i see before me those who compose the worshippers at this church armed  and attempting to enter for the purpose of violence to this sacred place  oh  let me beseech you  lose not a moment  but return to your homes  and repent of that which you have already done  it is not yet too late  listen  i pray you  to the voice of one with whom you have so often joined in prayer to the throne of the almighty  who is now looking upon your actions this appeal was heard respectfully  but it was evidently very far from suiting the feelings and the wishes of those to whom it was addressed the presence of the clergyman was evidently an unexpected circumstance and the more especially too as he appeared in that costume which they had been accustomed to regard with a reverence almost amounting to veneration  he saw the favourable effect he had produced  and anxious to follow it up  he added let this little ebullition of feeling pass away  my friends  and believe me  when i assure you upon my sacred word  that whatever ground there may be for complaint or subject for inquiry  shall be fully and fairly met  and that the greatest exertions shall be made to restore peace and tranquillity to all of you it s all about the vampyre  cried one fellow mr  leigh  how should you like a vampyre in the pulpit hush  hush  can it be possible that you know so little of the works of that great being whom you all pretend to adore  as to believe that he would create any class of beings of a nature such as those you ascribe to that terrific word  oh  let me pray of you to get rid of these superstitions alike disgraceful to yourselves and afflicting to me the clergyman had the satisfaction of seeing the crowd rapidly thinning from before the gates  and he believed his exhortations were having all the effect he wished  it was not until he heard a loud shout behind him and  upon hastily turning  saw that the churchyard had been scaled at another place by some fifty or sixty persons  that his heart sunk within him  and he began to feel that what he had dreaded would surely come to pass even then he might have done something in the way of pacific exertion but for the interference of waggles  the beadle  who spoilt everything chapter xlv the open graves the dead bodies a scene of terror illustration we have said waggles spoilt everything  and so he did  for before mr leigh could utter a word more  or advance two steps towards the rioters waggles charged them staff in hand  and there soon ensued a riot of a most formidable description a kind of desperation seemed to have seized the beadle  and certainly by his sudden and unexpected attack  he achieved wonders  when  however a dozen hands got hold of the staff  and it was wrenched from him  and he was knocked down  and half a dozen people rolled over him  waggles was not near the man he had been  and he would have been very well content to have lain quiet where he was  this  however  he was not permitted to do  for two or three  who had felt what a weighty instrument of warfare the parochial staff was  lifted him bodily from the ground  and canted him over the wall  without much regard to whether he fell on a hard or a soft place on the other side this feat accomplished  no further attention was paid to mr  leigh  who finding that his exhortations were quite unheeded  retired into the church with an appearance of deep affliction about him  and locked himself in the vestry the crowd now had entire possession without even the sort of control that an exhortation assumed over them of the burying ground  and soon in a dense mass were these desperate and excited people collected round the well known spot where lay the mortal remains of miles  the butcher silence  cried a loud voice  and every one obeyed the mandate  looking towards the speaker  who was a tall  gaunt looking man  attired in a suit of faded black  and who now pressed forward to the front of the throng oh  cried one  it s fletcher  the ranter  what does he do here hear him  hear him  cried others  he won t stop us yes  hear him  cried the tall man  waving his arms about like the sails of a windmill  yes  hear him  sons of darkness  you re all vampyres  and are continually sucking the life blood from each other  no wonder that the evil one has power over you all  you re as men who walk in the darkness when the sunlight invites you  and you listen to the words of humanity when those of a diviner origin are offered to your acceptance  but there shall be miracles in the land  and even in this place  set apart with a pretended piety that is in itself most damnable you shall find an evidence of the true light  and the proof that those who will follow me the true path to glory shall be found here within this grave  dig up miles  the butcher hear  hear  hear  hurra  said every body  mr  fletcher s not such a fool  after all  he means well yes  you sinners  said the ranter  and if you find miles  the butcher  decaying even as men are expected to decay whose mortal tabernacles are placed within the bowels of the earth you shall gather from that a great omen  and a sign that if you follow me you seek the lord  but i you find him looking fresh and healthy  as if the warm blood was still within his veins  you shall take that likewise as a signification that what i say to you shall be as the gospel  and that by coming to the chapel of the little boozlehum  ye shall achieve a great salvation very good  said a brawny fellow  advancing with a spade in his hand you get out of the way  and i ll soon have him up  here goes  like blue blazes the first shovelful of earth he took up  he cast over his head into the air  so that it fell in a shower among the mob  which of course raised a shout of indignation  and  as he continued so to dispose of the superfluous earth  a general row seemed likely to ensue  mr  fletcher opened his mouth to make a remark  and  as that feature of his face was rather a capacious one  a descending lump of mould  of a clayey consistency  fell into it  and got so wedged among his teeth  that in the process of extracting it he nearly brought some of those essential portions of his anatomy with it this was a state of things that could not last long  and he who had been so liberal with his spadesful of mould was speedily disarmed  and yet he was a popular favourite  and had done the thing so good humouredly  that nobody touched him  six or eight others  who had brought spades and pickaxes  now pushed forward to the work  and in an incredibly short space of time the grave of miles  the butcher  seemed to be very nearly excavated work of any kind or nature whatever  is speedily executed when done with a wish to get through it  and never  perhaps  within the memory of man was a grave opened in that churchyard with such a wonderful celerity the excitement of the crowd grew intense every available spot from which a view of the grave could be got  was occupied  for the last few minutes scarcely a remark had been uttered  and when  at last  the spade of one of those who were digging struck upon something that sounded like wood  you might have heard a pin drop  and each one there present drew his breath more shortly than before there he is  said the man  whose spade struck upon the coffin those few words broke the spell  and there was a general murmur  while every individual present seemed to shift his position in his anxiety to obtain a better view of what was about to ensue the coffin now having been once found  there seemed to be an increased impetus given to the work  the earth was thrown out with a rapidity that seemed almost the quick result of the working of some machine  and those closest to the grave s brink crouched down  and  intent as they were upon the progress of events  heeded not the damp earth that fell upon them  nor the frail brittle and humid remains of humanity that occasionally rolled to their feet it was  indeed  a scene of intense excitement a scene which only wanted a few prominent features in its foreground of a more intellectual and higher cast than composed the mob  to make it a fit theme for a painter of the highest talent and now the last few shovelfuls of earth that hid the top of the coffin were cast from the grave  and that narrow house which contained the mortal remains of him who was so well known  while in life  to almost every one then present  was brought to the gaze of eyes which never had seemed likely to have looked upon him again the cry was now for ropes  with which to raise the cumbrous mass  but these were not to be had  no one thought of providing himself with such appliances  so that by main strength  only  could the coffin be raised to the brink the difficulty of doing this was immense  for there was nothing tangible to stand upon  and even when the mould from the sides was sufficiently cleared away  that the handles of the coffin could be laid hold of  they came away immediately in the grasp of those who did so but the more trouble that presented itself to the accomplishment of the designs of the mob  the more intent that body seemed upon carrying out to the full extent their original designs finding it quite impossible by bodily strength to raise the coffin of the butcher from the position in which it had got imbedded by excessive rains  a boy was hastily despatched to the village for ropes  and never did boy run with such speed before  for all his own curiosity was excited in the issue of an adventure  that to his young imagination was appallingly interesting as impatient as mobs usually are  they had not time  in this case  for the exercise of that quality of mind before the boy came back with the necessary means of exerting quite a different species of power against the butcher s coffin strong ropes were slid under the inert mass  and twenty hands at once plied the task of raising that receptacle of the dead from what had been presumed to be its last resting place  the ropes strained and creaked and many thought that they would burst asunder sooner than raise the heavy coffin of the defunct butcher it is singular what reasons people find for backing their opinion you may depend he s a vampyre  said one  or it wouldn t be so difficult to get him out of the grave oh  there can be no mistake about that  said one  when did a natural christian s coffin stick in the mud in that way ah  to be sure  said another  i knew no good would come of his goings on  he never was a decent sort of man like his neighbours  and many queer things have been said of him that i have no doubt are true enough if we did but know the rights of them ah  but  said a young lad  thrusting his head between the two who were talking  if he is a vampyre  how does he get out of his coffin of a night with all that weight of mould a top of him one of the men considered for a moment  and then finding no rational answer occur to him  he gave the boy a box on the ear  saying i should like to know what business that is of yours  boys  now a days ain t like the boys in my time  they think nothing now of putting their spokes in grown up people s wheels  just as if their opinions were of any consequence now  by a vigorous effort  those who were tugging at the ropes succeeded in moving the coffin a little  and that first step was all the difficulty  for it was loosened from the adhesive soil in which it lay and now came up with considerable facility there was a half shout of satisfaction at this result  while some of the congregation turned pale  and trembled at the prospect of the sight which was about to present itself  the coffin was dragged from the grave s brink fairly among the long rank grass that flourished in the churchyard  and then they all looked at it for a time  and the men who had been most earnest in raising it wiped the perspiration from their brows  and seemed to shrink from the task of opening that receptacle of the dead now that it was fairly in their power so to do each man looked anxiously in his neighbour s face  and several audibly wondered why somebody else didn t open the coffin there s no harm in it  said one  if he s a vampyre  we ought to know it  and  if he ain t  we can t do any hurt to a dead man oughtn t we to have the service for the dead  said one yes  said the impertinent boy who had before received the knock on the head  i think we ought to have that read backwards this ingenious idea was recompensed by a great many kicks and cuffs which ought to have been sufficient to have warned him of the great danger of being a little before his age in wit where s the use of shirking the job  cried he who had been so active in shoveling the mud upon the multitude  why  you cowardly sneaking set of humbugs  you re half afraid  now afraid afraid  cried everybody  who s afraid ah  who s afraid  said a little man  advancing  and assuming an heroic attitude  i always notice  if anybody s afraid  it s some big fellow with more bones than brains at this moment  the man to whom this reproach was more particularly levelled  raised a horrible shout of terror  and cried out  in frantic accents he s a coming he s a coming the little man fell at once into the grave  while the mob  with one accord  turned tail  and fled in all directions  leaving him alone with the coffin  such a fighting  and kicking  and scrambling ensued to get over the wall of the grave yard  that this great fellow  who had caused all the mischief  burst into such peals of laughter that the majority of the people became aware that it was a joke  and came creeping back looking as sheepish as possible some got up very faint sorts of laugh  and said very good  and swore they saw what big dick meant from the first  and only ran to make the others run very good  said dick  i m glad you enjoyed it  that s all  my eye what a scampering there was among you  where s my little friend  who was so infernally cunning about bones and brains with some difficulty the little man was extricated from the grave  and then  oh  for the consistency of a mob  they all laughed at him  those very people who  heedless of all the amenities of existence  had been trampling upon each other  and roaring with terror  actually had the impudence to laugh at him  and call him a cowardly little rascal  and say it served him right but such is popularity well  if nobody won t open the coffin  said big dick  i will  so here goes  i knowed the old fellow when he was alive  and many a time he s d d me and i ve d d him  so i ain t a going to be afraid of him now he s dead  we was very intimate  you see  cos we was the two heaviest men in the parish  there s a reason for everything ah  dick s the fellow to do it  cried a number of persons  there s nobody like dick for opening a coffin  he s the man as don t care for nothing ah  you snivelling curs  said dick  i hate you  if it warn t for my own satisfaction  and all for to prove that my old friend  the butcher as weighed seventeen stone  and stood six feet two and a half on his own sole  i d see you all jolly well d d first  said the boy  open the lid  dick  let s have a look ah  you re a rum un  said dick  arter my own heart  i sometimes thinks as you must be a nevy  or some sort of relation of mine howsomdever  here goes  who d a thought that i should ever had a look at old fat and thunder again that s what i used to call him  and then he used to request me to go down below  where i needn t turn round to light my blessed pipe hell we know  said the boy  why don t you open the lid  dick i m a going  said dick  kim up he introduced the corner of a shovel between the lid and the coffin  and giving it a sudden wrench  he loosened it all down one side a shudder pervaded the multitude  and  popularly speaking  you might have heard a pin drop in that crowded churchyard at that eventful moment dick then proceeded to the other side  and executed the same manoeuvre now for it  he said  we shall see him in a moment  and we ll think we seed him still what a lark  said the boy you hold yer jaw  will yer  who axed you for a remark  blow yer  what do you mean by squatting down there  like a cock sparrow  with a pain in his tail  hanging yer head  too  right over the coffin  did you never hear of what they call a fluvifium coming from the dead  yer ignorant beast  as is enough to send nobody to blazes in a minute  get out of the way of the cold meat  will yer a what  do you say  dick request information from the extreme point of my elbow dick threw down the spade  and laying hold of the coffin lid with both hands  he lifted it off  and flung it on one side there was a visible movement and an exclamation among the multitude some were pushed down  in the eager desire of those behind to obtain a sight of the ghastly remains of the butcher  those at a distance were frantic  and the excitement was momentarily increasing they might all have spared themselves the trouble  for the coffin was empty here was no dead butcher  nor any evidence of one ever having been there  not even the grave clothes  the only thing at all in the receptacle of the dead was a brick dick s astonishment was so intense that his eyes and mouth kept opening together to such an extent  that it seemed doubtful when they would reach their extreme point of elongation  he then took up the brick and looked at it curiously  and turned it over and over  examined the ends and the sides with a critical eye  and at length he said well  i m blowed  here s a transmogrification  he s consolidified himself into a blessed brick my eye  here s a curiosity but you don t mean to say that s the butcher  dick  said the boy dick reached over  and gave him a tap on the head with the brick there  he said  that s what i calls occular demonstration  do you believe it now  you blessed infidel  what s more natural  he was an out and out brick while he was alive  and he s turned to a brick now he s dead give it to me  dick  said the boy  i should like to have that brick just for the fun of the thing i ll see you turned into a pantile first  i sha n t part with this here  it looks so blessed sensible  it s a gaining on me every minute as a most remarkable likeness  d d if it ain t by this time the bewilderment of the mob had subsided  now that there was no dead butcher to look upon  they fancied themselves most grievously injured  and  somehow or other  dick  notwithstanding all his exertions in their service  was looked upon in the light of a showman who had promised some startling exhibition and then had disappointed his auditors the first intimation he had of popular vengeance was a stone thrown at him  but dick s eye happened to be upon the fellow who threw it  and collaring him in a moment  he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head which confused his faculties for a week hark ye  he then cried  with a loud voice  don t interfere with me you know it won t go down  there s something wrong here  and  as one of yourselves  i m as much interested in finding out what it is as any of you can possibly be  there seems to be some truth in this vampyre business  our old friend  the butcher  you see  is not in his grave where is he then the mob looked at each other  and none attempted to answer the question why  of course  he s a vampyre  said dick  and you may all of you expect to see him  in turn  come into your bed room windows with a burst  and lay hold of you like a million and a half of leeches rolled into one there was a general expression of horror  and then dick continued you d better all of you go home  i shall have no hand in pulling up any more of the coffins this is a dose for me  of course you can do what you like illustration pull them all up  cried a voice  pull them all up  let s see how many vampyres there are in the churchyard well  it s no business of mine  said dick  but i wouldn t  if i was you you may depend  said one  that dick knows something about it  or he wouldn t take it so easy ah  down with him  said the man who had received the box on the ears he s perhaps a vampyre himself the mob made a demonstration towards him  but dick stood his ground  and they paused again now  you re a cowardly set  he said  cause you re disappointed  you want to come upon me  now  i ll just show what a little thing will frighten you all again  and i warn beforehand it will  so you sha n t say you didn t know it  and were taken by surprise the mob looked at him  wondering what he was going to do once  twice  thrice  he said  and then he flung the brick up into the air an immense height  and shouted heads  in a loud tone a general dispersion of the crowd ensued  and the brick fell in the centre of a very large circle indeed there you are again  said dick  why  what a nice act you are what fun  said the boy  it s a famous coffin  this  dick  and he laid himself down in the butcher s last resting place  i never was in a coffin before it s snug enough ah  you re a rum un  said dick  you re such a inquiring genius  you is  you ll get your head into some hole one day  and not be able to get it out again  and then i shall see you a kicking  hush  lay still don t say anything good again  said the boy  what shall i do give a sort of a howl and a squeak  when they ve all come back again won t i  said the boy  pop on the lid there you are  said dick  d d if i don t adopt you  and bring you up to the science of nothing now  listen to me  good people all  added dick  i have really got something to say to you at this intimation the people slowly gathered again round the grave listen  said dick  solemnly  it strikes me there s some tremendous do going on yes  there is  said several who were foremost it won t be long before you ll all of you be most d nably astonished but let me beg of all you not to accuse me of having anything to do with it  provided i tell you all i know no  dick  we won t we won t we won t good  then  listen  i don t know anything  but i ll tell you what i think  and that s as good  i don t think that this brick is the butcher but i think  that when you least expect it hush  come a little closer yes  yes  we are closer well  then  i say  when you all least expect it  and when you ain t dreaming of such a thing  you ll hear something of my fat friend as is dead and gone  that will astonish you all dick paused  and he gave the coffin a slight kick  as intimation to the boy that he might as well be doing his part in the drama  upon which that ingenious young gentleman set up such a howl  that even dick jumped  so unearthly did it sound within the confines of that receptacle of the dead but if the effect upon him was great  what must it have been upon those whom it took completely unawares  for a moment or two they seemed completely paralysed  and then they frightened the boy  for the shout of terror that rose from so many throats at once was positively alarming this jest of dick s was final  for  before three minutes had elapsed the churchyard was clear of all human occupants save himself and the boy  who had played his part so well in the coffin get out  said dick  it s all right we ve done em at last  and now you may depend upon it they won t be in a hurry to come here again  you keep your own counsel  or else somebody will serve you out for this  i don t think you re altogether averse to a bit of fun  and if you keep yourself quiet  you ll have the satisfaction of hearing what s said about this affair in every pot house in the village  and no mistake chapter xlvi the preparations for leaving bannerworth hall  and the mysterious conduct of the admiral and mr  chillingworth illustration it seemed now  that  by the concurrence of all parties  bannerworth hall was to be abandoned  and  notwithstanding henry was loth as he had indeed  from the first shown himself to leave the ancient abode of his race  yet  as not only flora  but the admiral and his friend mr chillingworth seemed to be of opinion that it would be a prudent course to adopt  he felt that it would not become him to oppose the measure he  however  now made his consent to depend wholly upon the full and free acquiescence of every member of the family if  he said  there be any among us who will say to me continue to keep open the house in which we have passed so many happy hours  and let the ancient home of our race still afford a shelter to us  i shall feel myself bound to do so  but if both my mother and my brother agree to a departure from it  and that its hearth shall be left cold and desolate be it so  i will not stand in the way of any unanimous wish or arrangement we may consider that  then  as settled  said the admiral  for i have spoken to your brother  and he is of our opinion  therefore  my boy  we may all be off as soon as we can conveniently get under weigh but my mother oh  there  i don t know  you must speak to her yourself  i never  if i can help it  interfere with the women folks if she consent  then i am willing will you ask her i will not ask her to leave  because i know  then  what answer she would at once give  but she shall hear the proposition  and i will leave her to decide upon it  unbiased in her judgment by any stated opinion of mine upon the matter good  that ll do  and the proper way to put it  too  there s no mistake about that  i can tell you henry  although he went through the ceremony of consulting his mother had no sort of doubt before he did so that she was sufficiently aware of the feelings and wishes of flora to be prepared to yield a ready assent to the proposition of leaving the hall moreover  mr  marchdale had  from the first  been an advocate of such a course of proceeding  and henry well knew how strong an influence he had over mrs  bannerworth s mind  in consequence of the respect in which she held him as an old and valued friend he was  therefore  prepared for what his mother said  which was my dear henry  you know that the wishes of my children  since they have been grown up and capable of coming to a judgment for themselves  have ever been laws to me  if you  among you all  agree to leave this place do so but will you leave it freely  mother most freely i go with you all  what is it that has made this house and all its appurtenances pleasant in my eyes  but the presence in it of those who are so dear to me  if you all leave it  you take with you the only charms it ever possessed  so it becomes in itself as nothing  i am quite ready to accompany you all anywhere  so that we do but keep together then  mother  we may consider that as settled as you please it s scarcely as i please  i must confess that i would fain have clung with a kind of superstitious reverence to this ancient abiding place of my race  but it may not be so  those  perchance  who are more practically able to come to correct conclusions  in consequence of their feelings not being sufficiently interested to lead them astray  have decided otherwise  and  therefore  i am content to leave do not grieve at it  henry  there has hung a cloud of misfortune over us all since the garden of this house became the scene of an event which we can none of us remember but with terror and shuddering two generations of our family must live and die before the remembrance of that circumstance can be obliterated  but we will think of it no more there can no doubt but that the dreadful circumstance to which both mrs bannerworth and henry alluded  was the suicide of the father of the family in the gardens which before has been hinted at in the course of this narration  as being a circumstance which had created a great sensation at the time  and cast a great gloom for many months over the family the reader will  doubtless  too  recollect that  at his last moments this unhappy individual was said to have uttered some incoherent words about some hidden money  and that the rapid hand of death alone seemed to prevent him from being explicit upon that subject  and left it merely a matter of conjecture as years had rolled on  this affair  even as a subject of speculation had ceased to occupy the minds of any of the bannerworth family  and several of their friends  among whom was mr  marchdale  were decidedly of opinion that the apparently pointed and mysterious words uttered were but the disordered wanderings of an intellect already hovering on the confines of eternity indeed  far from any money  of any amount  being a disturbance to the last moments of the dissolute man  whose vices and extravagances had brought his family  to such ruin  it was pretty generally believed that he had committed suicide simply from a conviction of the impossibility of raising any more supplies of cash  to enable him to carry on the career which he had pursued for so long but to resume henry at once communicated to the admiral what his mother had said  and then the whole question regarding the removal being settled in the affirmative  nothing remained to be done but to set about it as quickly as possible the bannerworths lived sufficiently distant from the town to be out of earshot of the disturbances which were then taking place  and so completely isolated were they from all sort of society  that they had no notion of the popular disturbance which varney the vampyre had given rise to it was not until the following morning that mr  chillingworth  who had been home in the meantime  brought word of what had taken place  and that great commotion was still in the town  and that the civil authorities  finding themselves by far too weak to contend against the popular will  had sent for assistance to a garrison town  some twenty miles distant it was a great grief to the bannerworth family to hear these tidings not that they were in any way  except as victims  accessory to creating the disturbance about the vampyre  but it seemed to promise a kind of notoriety which they might well shrink from  and which they were just the people to view with dislike view the matter how we like  however  it is not to be considered as at all probable that the bannerworth family would remain long in ignorance of what a great sensation they had created unwittingly in the neighbourhood the very reasons which had induced their servants to leave their establishment  and prefer throwing themselves completely out of place rather than remain in so ill omened a house  were sure to be bruited abroad far and wide and that  perhaps  when they came to consider of it  would suffice to form another good and substantial reason for leaving the hall  and seeking a refuge in obscurity from the extremely troublesome sort of popularity incidental to their peculiar situation mr  chillingworth felt uncommonly chary of telling them all that had taken place  although he was well aware that the proceedings of the riotous mob had not terminated with the little disappointment at the old ruin  to which they had so effectually chased varney the vampyre  but to lose him so singularly when he got there no doubt he possessed the admiral with the uproar that was going on in the town  for the latter did hint a little of it to henry bannerworth hilloa  he said to henry  as he saw him walking in the garden  it strikes me if you and your ship s crew continue in these latitudes you ll get as notorious as the flying dutchman in the southern ocean how do you mean  said henry why  it s a sure going proverb to say  that a nod s as good as a wink but  the fact is  it s getting rather too well known to be pleasant that a vampyre has struck up rather a close acquaintance with your family  i understand there s a precious row in the town indeed yes  bother the particulars  for i don t know them  but  hark ye  by to morrow i ll have found a place for you to go to  so pack up the sticks  get all your stores ready to clear out  and make yourself scarce from this place i understand you  said henry  we have become the subject of popular rumour  i ve only to beg of you  admiral  that you ll say nothing of this to flora  she has already suffered enough  heaven knows  do not let her have the additional infliction of thinking that her name is made familiar in every pothouse in the town leave me alone for that  said the admiral  do you think i m an ass ay  ay  said jack pringle  who came in at that moment  and thought the question was addressed to him who spoke to you  you bad looking horse marine me a horse marine  didn t you ask a plain question of a fellow  and get a plain answer why  you son of a bad looking gun  what do you mean by that  i tell you what it is  jack  i ve let you come sneaking too often on the quarter deck  and now you come poking your fun at your officers  you rascal i poking fun  said jack  couldn t think of such a thing  i should just as soon think of you making a joke as me now  i tell you what it is  i shall just strike you off the ship s books  and you shall just go and cruise by yourself  i ve done with you go and tell that to the marines  if you like  said jack  i ain t done with you yet  for a jolly long watch  why  what do you suppose would become of you  you great babby  without me  ain t i always a conveying you from place to place  and steering you through all sorts of difficulties d n your impudence well  then  d n yours shiver my timbers ay  you may do what you like with your own timbers and you won t leave me sartingly not come here  then jack might have expected a gratuity  for he advanced with alacrity there  said the admiral  as he laid his stick across his shoulders that s your last month s wages  don t spend it all at once well  i m d d  said jack  who d have thought of that he s a turning rumgumtious  and no mistake  howsomdever  i must turn it over in my mind  and be even with him  somehow i owes him one for that  i say admiral what now  you lubber nothing  turn that over in your mind  and away jack walked  not quite satisfied  but feeling  at least  that he had made a demonstration of attack as for the admiral  he considered that the thump he had given jack with the stick  and it was no gentle one  was a decided balancing of accounts up to that period  and as he remained likewise master of the field  he was upon the whole very well satisfied these last few words which had been spoken to henry by admiral bell more than any others  induced him to hasten his departure from bannerworth hall  he had walked away when the altercation between jack pringle and the admiral began  for he had seen sufficient of those wordy conflicts between those originals to be quite satisfied that neither of them meant what he said of a discouraging character towards the other and that far from there being any unfriendly feeling contingent upon those little affairs  they were only a species of friendly sparring which both parties enjoyed extremely he went direct to flora  and he said to her since we are all agreed upon the necessity  or  at all events  upon the expediency of a departure from the hall  i think  sister  the sooner we carry out that determination the better and the pleasanter for us all it will be  do you think you could remove so hastily as to morrow to morrow  that is soon indeed i grant you that it is so  but admiral bell assures me that he will have everything in readiness  and a place provided for us to go to by then would it be possible to remove from a house like this so very quickly yes  sister  if you look around you  you will see that a great portion of the comforts you enjoy in this mansion belong to it as a part of its very structure  and are not removable at pleasure  what we really have to take away is very little  the urgent want of money during our father s lifetime induced him  as you may recollect even  at various times to part with much that was ornamental  as well as useful  which was in the hall  you will recollect that we seldom returned from those little continental tours which to us were so delightful  without finding some old familiar objects gone  which  upon inquiry  we found had been turned into money  to meet some more than usually pressing demand that is true  brother  i recollect well so that  upon the whole  sister  there is little to remove well  well  be it so  i will prepare our mother for this sudden step believe me  my heart goes with it  and as a force of vengeful circumstances have induced us to remove from this home  which was once so full of pleasant recollections  it is certainly better  as you say that the act should be at once consummated  than left hanging in terror over our minds then i ll consider that as settled  said henry chapter xlvii the removal from the hall the night watch  and the alarm illustration mrs  bannerworth s consent having been already given to the removal  she said at once  when appealed to  that she was quite ready to go at any time her children thought expedient upon this  henry sought the admiral  and told him as much  at the same time adding my sister feared that we should have considerable trouble in the removal  but i have convinced her that such will not be the case  as we are by no means overburdened with cumbrous property cumbrous property  said the admiral  why  what do you mean  i beg leave to say  that when i took the house  i took the table and chairs with it  d n it  what good do you suppose an empty house is to me the tables and chairs yes  i took the house just as it stands  don t try and bamboozle me out of it  i tell you  you ve nothing to move but yourselves and immediate personal effects i was not aware  admiral  that that was your plan well  then  now you are  listen to me  i ve circumvented the enemy too often not to know how to get up a plot  jack and i have managed it all to morrow evening  after dark  and before the moon s got high enough to throw any light  you and your brother  and miss flora and your mother will come out of the house  and jack and i will lead you where you re to go to  there s plenty of furniture where you re a going  and so you will get off free  without anybody knowing anything about it well  admiral  i ve said it before  and it is the unanimous opinion of us all  that everything should be left to you  you have proved yourself too good a friend to us for us to hesitate at all in obeying your commands  arrange everything  i pray you  according to your wishes and feelings  and you will find there shall be no cavilling on our parts that s right  there s nothing like giving a command to some one person there s no good done without  now i ll manage it all  mind you  seven o clock to morrow evening everything is to be ready  and you will all be prepared to leave the hall it shall be so who s that giving such a thundering ring at the gate nay  i know not  we have few visitors and no servants  so i must e en be my own gate porter henry walked to the gate  and having opened it  a servant in a handsome livery stepped a pace or two into the garden well  said henry is mr  henry bannerworth within  or admiral bell both  cried the admiral  i m admiral bell  and this is mr  henry bannerworth  what do you want with us  you d d gingerbread looking flunkey sir  my master desires his compliments his very best compliments and he wants to know how you are after your flurry what after your a a flurry and excitement who is your master  said henry sir francis varney the devil  said the admiral  if that don t beat all the impudence i ever came near  our flurry  ah  i like that fellow  just go and tell him no  no  said henry  interposing  send back no message  say to your master  fellow  that mr  henry bannerworth feels that not only has he no claim to sir francis varney s courtesy  but that he would rather be without it oh  ha  said the footman  adjusting his collar  very good  this seems a d d  old fashioned  outlandish place of yours  any ale now  shiver my hulks  said the admiral hush  hush  said henry  who knows but there may be a design in this we have no ale oh  ah  dem dry as dust  by god  what does the old commodore say  any message  my ancient greek no  thank you  said the admiral  bless you  nothing  what did you give for that waistcoat  d n you  ha  ha  you re a clever fellow ah  the old gentleman s ill  however  i ll take back his compliments and that he s much obliged at sir francis s condescension  at the same time  i suppose may place in my eye what i may get out of either of you without hindering me seeing my way back  ha  ha  adieu adieu bravo  said the admiral  that s it go it now for it  d n it  it is a do the admiral s calmness during the latter part of the dialogue arose from the fact that over the flunkey s shoulder  and at some little distance off  he saw jack pringle taking off his jacket  and rolling up his sleeves in that deliberate sort of way that seemed to imply a determination of setting about some species of work that combined the pleasant with the useful jack executed many nods to and winks at the livery servant  and jerked his thumb likewise in the direction of a pump near at hand  in a manner that spoke as plainly as possible  that john was to be pumped upon and now the conference was ended  and sir francis s messenger turned to go  but jack pringle bothered him completely  for he danced round him in such a singular manner  that  turn which way he would  there stood jack pringle  in some grotesque attitude  intercepting him  and so he edged him on  till he got him to the pump jack  said the admiral ay  ay  sir don t pump on that fellow now ay  ay  sir  give us a hand jack laid hold of him by the two ears  and holding him under the pump kicked his shins until he completely gathered himself beneath the spout it was in vain that he shouted murder  help  fire  thieves  jack was inexorable  and the admiral pumped jack turned the fellow s head about in a very scientific manner  so as to give him a fair dose of hydropathic treatment  and in a few minutes never was human being more thoroughly saturated with moisture than was sir francis varney s servant  he had left off hallooing for aid  for he found that whenever he did so  jack held his mouth under the spout which was decidedly unpleasant  so  with a patience that looked like heroic fortitude  he was compelled to wait until the admiral was tired of pumping very good  at length he said  now  jack  for fear this fellow catcher cold  be so good as to get a horsewhip  and see him off the premises with it ay  ay  sir  said jack  and i say  old fellow  you can take back all our blessed compliments now  and say you ve been flurried a little yourself  and if so be as you came here as dry as dust  d e  you go back as wet as a mop  won t it do to kick him out  sir very well as you please  jack then here goes  and jack proceeded to kick the shivering animal from the garden with a vehemence that soon convinced him of the necessity of getting out of it as quickly as possible how it was that sir francis varney  after the fearful race he had had got home again across the fields  free from all danger  and back to his own house  from whence he sent so cool and insolent a message  they could not conceive but such must certainly be the fact  somehow or another  he had escaped all danger  and  with a calm insolence peculiar to the man  he had no doubt adopted the present mode of signifying as much to the bannerworths the insolence of his servant was  no doubt  a matter of pre arrangement with that individual  however he might have set about it con amore  as for the termination of the adventure  that  of course  had not been at all calculated upon  but  like most tools of other people s insolence or ambition  the insolence of the underling had received both his own punishment and his master s we know quite enough of sir francis varney to feel assured that he would rather consider it as a good jest than otherwise of his footman  so that with the suffering he endured at the bannerworths  and the want of sympathy he was likely to find at home  that individual had certainly nothing to congratulate himself upon but the melancholy reminiscence of his own cleverness but were the mob satisfied with what had occurred in the churchyard they were not  and that night was to witness the perpetration of a melancholy outrage  such as the history of the time presents no parallel to the finding of a brick in the coffin of the butcher  instead of the body of that individual  soon spread as a piece of startling intelligence all over the place  and the obvious deduction that was drawn from the circumstance  seemed to be that the deceased butcher was unquestionably a vampyre  and out upon some expedition at the time when his coffin was searched how he had originally got out of that receptacle for the dead was certainly a mystery  but the story was none the worse for that  indeed an ingenious individual found a solution for that part of the business for  as he said  nothing was more natural  when anybody died who was capable of becoming a vampyre  than for other vampyres who knew it to dig him up  and lay him out in the cold beams of the moonlight  until he acquired the same sort of vitality they themselves possessed  and joined their horrible fraternity in lieu of a better explanation and  after all  it was no bad one this theory was generally received  and  with a shuddering horror  people asked themselves  if the whole of the churchyard were excavated  how many coffins would be found tenantless by the dead which had been supposed  by simple minded people  to inhabit them the presence  however  of a body of dragoons  towards evening effectually prevented any renewed attack upon the sacred precincts of the churchyard  and it was a strange and startling thing to see that country town under military surveillance  and sentinels posted at its principal buildings this measure smothered the vengeance of the crowd  and insured  for a time  the safety of sir francis varney  for no considerable body of persons could assemble for the purpose of attacking his house again without being followed  so such a step was not attempted it had so happened  however  that on that very day  the funeral of a young man was to have taken place  who had put up for a time at that same inn where admiral bell was first introduced to the reader  he had become seriously ill  and  after a few days of indisposition  which had puzzled the country practitioners  breathed his last he was to have been buried in the village churchyard on the very day of the riot and confusion incidental to the exhumation of the coffin of the butcher  and probably from that circumstance we may deduce the presence of the clergyman in canonicals at the period of the riot when it was found that so disorderly a mob possessed the churchyard  the idea of burying the stranger on that day was abandoned  but still all would have gone on quietly as regarded him  had it not been for the folly of one of the chamber maids at the tavern this woman  with all the love of gossip incidental to her class  had from the first  entered so fully into all the particulars concerning vampyres  that she fairly might be considered to be a little deranged on that head  her imagination had been so worked upon  that she was in an unfit state to think of anything else  and if ever upon anybody a stern and revolting superstition was calculated to produce direful effects  it was upon this woman the town was tolerably quiet  the presence of the soldiery had frightened some and amused others  and no doubt the night would have passed off serenely  had she not suddenly rushed into the street  and with bewildered accents and frantic gestures shouted a vampyre a vampyre a vampyre these words soon collected a crowd around her  and then  with screaming accents  which would have been quite enough to convince any reflecting person that she had actually gone distracted upon that point  she cried come into the house come into the house  look upon the dead body  that should have been in its grave  it s fresher now than it was the day on which it died  and there s a colour in its cheeks  a vampyre a vampyre a vampyre  heaven save us from a vampyre the strange  infuriated  maniacal manner in which these words were uttered  produced an astonishingly exciting effect among the mob several women screamed  and some few fainted  the torch was laid again to the altar of popular feeling  and the fierce flame of superstition burnt brightly and fiercely some twenty or thirty persons  with shouts and exclamations  rushed into the inn  while the woman who had created the disturbance still continued to rave  tearing her hair  and shrieking at intervals  until she fell exhausted upon the pavement soon  from a hundred throats  rose the dreadful cry of a vampyre a vampyre  the alarm was given throughout the whole town  the bugles of the military sounded  there was a clash of arms the shrieks of women altogether  the premonitory symptoms of such a riot as was not likely to be quelled without bloodshed and considerable disaster it is truly astonishing the effect which one weak or vicious minded person can produce upon a multitude here was a woman whose opinion would have been accounted valueless upon the most common place subject  and whose word would not have passed for twopence  setting a whole town by the ears by force of nothing but her sheer brutal ignorance it is a notorious physiological fact  that after four or five days  or even a week  the bodies of many persons assume an appearance of freshness  such as might have been looked for in vain immediately after death it is one of the most insidious processes of that decay which appears to regret with its       offensive fingers  to mar the lines where beauty      lingers but what did the chamber maid know of physiology  probably  she would have asked if it was anything good to eat  and so  of course  having her head full of vampyres  she must needs produce so lamentable a scene of confusion  the results of which we almost sicken at detailing chapter xlviii the stake and the dead body illustration the mob seemed from the first to have an impression that  as regarded the military force  no very serious results would arise from that quarter  for it was not to be supposed that  on an occasion which could not possibly arouse any ill blood on the part of the soldiery  or on which they could have the least personal feeling  they would like to get a bad name  which would stick to them for years to come it was no political riot  on which men might be supposed  in consequence of differing in opinion  to have their passions inflamed  so that although the call of the civil authorities for military aid had been acceded to  yet it was hoped  and  indeed  almost understood by the officers  that their operations would lie confined more to a demonstration of power  than anything else besides  some of the men had got talking to the townspeople  and had heard all about the vampyre story  and not being of the most refined or educated class themselves  they felt rather interested than otherwise in the affair under these circumstances  then  we are inclined to think  that the disorderly mob of that inn had not so wholesome a fear as it was most certainly intended they should have of the redcoats  then  again  they were not attacking the churchyard  which  in the first case  was the main point in dispute  and about which the authorities had felt so very sore  inasmuch as they felt that  if once the common people found out that the sanctity of such places could be outraged with impunity  they would lose their reverence for the church  that is to say  for the host of persons who live well and get fat in this country by the trade of religion illustration consequently  this churchyard was the main point of defence  and it was zealously looked to when it need not have been done so  while the public house where there really reigned mischief was half unguarded there are always in all communities  whether large or small  a number of persons who really have  or fancy they have  something to gain by disturbance  these people  of course  care not for what pretext the public peace is violated  so long as there is a row  and something like an excuse for running into other people s houses  they are satisfied to get into a public house under such circumstances is an unexpected treat  and thus  when the mob rushed into the inn with such symptoms of fury and excitement  there went with the leaders of the disturbance a number of persons who never thought of getting further than the bar where they attacked the spirit taps with an alacrity which showed how great was their love for ardent compounds leaving these persons behind  however  we will follow those who  with a real superstition  and a furious interest in the affair of the vampyre made their way towards the upper chamber  determining to satisfy themselves if there were truth in the statement so alarmingly made by the woman who had created such an emotion it is astonishing what people will do in crowds  in comparison with the acts that they would be able to commit individually  there is usually a calmness  a sanctity  a sublimity about death  which irresistibly induces a respect for its presence  alike from the educated or from the illiterate  and let the object of the fell destroyer s presence be whom it may  the very consciousness that death has claimed it for its own invests it with a halo of respect  that  in life  the individual could never aspire to probably let us precede these furious rioters for a few moments  and look upon the chamber of the dead that chamber  which for a whole week  had been looked upon with a kind of shuddering terror that chamber which had been darkened by having its sources of light closed  as if it were a kind of disrespect to the dead to allow the pleasant sunshine to fall upon the faded form and every inhabitant of that house  upon ascending and descending its intricate and ancient staircases  had walked with a quiet and subdued step past that one particular door even the tones of voice in which they spoke to each other  while they knew that that sad remnant of mortality was in the house  was quiet and subdued  as if the repose of death was but a mortal sleep  and could be broken by rude sounds ay  even some of these very persons  who now with loud and boisterous clamour  had rushed into the place  had visited the house and talked in whispers  but then they were alone  and men will do in throngs acts which  individually  they would shrink from with compunction or cowardice  call it which we will the chamber of death is upon the second story of the house  it is a back room  the windows of which command a view of that half garden  half farm yard  which we find generally belonging to country inns but now the shutters were closed  with the exception of one small opening  that  in daylight  would have admitted a straggling ray of light to fall upon the corpse  now  however  that the sombre shades of evening had wrapped everything in gloom  the room appeared in total darkness  so that the most of those adventurers who had ventured into the place shrunk back until lights were procured from the lower part of the house  with which to enter the room a dim oil lamp in a niche sufficiently lighted the staircase  and  by the friendly aid of its glimmering beams  they had found their way up to the landing tolerably well  and had not thought of the necessity of having lights with which to enter the apartments  until they found them in utter darkness these requisites  however  were speedily procured from the kitchen of the inn  indeed  anything that was wanted was laid hold of without the least word of remark to the people of the place  as if might  from that evening forthwith  was understood to constitute right  in that town up to this point no one had taken a very prominent part in the attack upon the inn if attack it could be called  but now the man whom chance or his own nimbleness  made the first of the throng  assumed to himself a sort of control over his companions and  turning to them  he said hark ye  my friends  we ll do everything quietly and properly  so i think we d better three or four of us go in at once  arm in arm psha  cried one who had just arrived with a light  it s your cowardice that speaks  i ll go in first  let those follow me who like and those who are afraid may remain where they are he at once dashed into the room  and this immediately broke the spell of fear which was beginning to creep over the others in consequence of the timid suggestion of the man who  up to that moment  had been first and foremost in the enterprise in an instant the chamber was half filled with persons  four or five of whom carried lights  so that  as it was not of very large dimensions  it was sufficiently illuminated for every object in it to be clearly visible there was the bed  smooth and unruffled  as if waiting for some expected guest  while close by its side a coffin  supported upon tressles  over which a sheet was partially thrown  contained the sad remains of him who little expected in life that  after death  he should be stigmatised as an example of one of the ghastliest superstitions that ever found a home in the human imagination it was evident that some one had been in the room  and that this was the woman whose excited fancy had led her to look upon the face of the corpse there could be no doubt  for the sheet was drawn aside just sufficiently to discover the countenance the fact was that the stranger was unknown at the inn  or probably ere this the coffin lid would have been screwed on  but it was hoped  up to the last moment  as advertisements had been put into the county papers that some one would come forward to identify and claim him such  however  had not been the case  and so his funeral had been determined upon the presence of so many persons at once effectually prevented any individual from exhibiting  even if he felt any superstitious fears about approaching the coffin  and so  with one accord  they surrounded it  and looked upon the face of the dead there was nothing repulsive in that countenance  the fact was that decomposition had sufficiently advanced to induce a relaxation of the muscles  and a softening of the fibres  so that an appearance of calmness and repose had crept over the face which it did not wear immediately after death it happened  too  that the face was full of flesh for the death had been sudden  and there had not been that wasting away of the muscles and integuments which makes the skin cling  as it were  to the bone  when the ravages of long disease have exhausted the physical frame there was  unquestionably  a plumpness  a freshness  and a sort of vitality about the countenance that was remarkable for a few moments there was a death like stillness in the apartment  and then one voice broke the silence by exclaiming he s a vampyre  and has come here to die  well he knows he d be taken up by sir francis varney  and become one of the crew yes  yes  cried several voices at once  a vampyre  a vampyre hold a moment  cried one  let us find somebody in the house who has seen him some days ago  and then we can ascertain if there s any difference in his looks this suggestion was agreed to  and a couple of stout men ran down stairs  and returned in a few moments with a trembling waiter  whom they had caught in the passage  and forced to accompany them this man seemed to think that he was to be made a dreadful example of in some sort of way  and  as he was dragged into the room  he trembled  and looked as pale as death what have i done  gentlemen  he said  i ain t a vampyre  don t be driving a stake through me  i assure you  gentlemen  i m only a waiter and have been for a matter of five and twenty years you ll be done no harm to  said one of his captors  you ve only got to answer a question that will be put to you oh  well  certainly  gentlemen  anything you please  coming coming  as i always say  give your orders  the waiter s in the room look upon the fare of that corpse certainly  certainly directly have you ever seen it before seen it before  lord bless you  yes  a dozen of times  i seed him afore he died  and i seed him arter  and when the undertaker s men came  i came up with them and i seed em put him in his coffin  you see i kept an eye on em  gentlemen  cos knows well enough what they is  a cousin of mine was in the trade  and he assures me as one of em always brings a tooth drawing concern in his pocket  and looks in the mouth of the blessed corpse to see if there s a blessed tooth worth pulling out hold your tongue  said one  we want none of your nonsense  do you see any difference now in the face of the corpse to what it was some days since well  i don t know  somehow  it don t look so rum does it look fresher well  somehow or another  now you mention it  it s very odd  but it does enough  cried the man who had questioned him  with considerable excitement of manner  neighbours  are we to have our wives and our children scared to death by vampyres no no  cried everybody is not this  then  one of that dreadful order of beings yes yes  what s to be done drive a stake through the body  and so prevent the possibility of anything in the shape of a restoration this was a terrific proposition  and even those who felt most strongly upon the subject  and had their fears most awakened  shrank from carrying it into effect  others  again  applauded it  although they determined  in their own minds  to keep far enough off from the execution of the job  which they hoped would devolve upon others  so that they might have all the security of feeling that such a process had been gone through with the supposed vampyre  without being in any way committed by the dreadful act nothing was easier than to procure a stake from the garden in the rear of the premises  but it was one thing to have the means at hand of carrying into effect so dreadful a proposition  and another actually to do it for the credit of human nature  we regret that even then  when civilisation and popular education had by no means made such rapid strides as in our times they have  such a proposition should be entertained for a moment  but so it was  and just as an alarm was given that a party of the soldiers had reached the inn and had taken possession of the doorway with a determination to arrest the rioters  a strong hedge stake had been procured  and everything was in readiness for the perpetration of the horrible deed even then those in the room  for they were tolerably sober  would have revolted  probably  from the execution of so fearful an act  but the entrance of a party of the military into the lower portion of the tavern  induced those who had been making free with the strong liquors below  to make a rush up stairs to their companions with the hope of escaping detection of the petty larceny  if they got into trouble on account of the riot these persons  infuriated by drink  were capable of anything  and to them  accordingly  the more sober parties gladly surrendered the disagreeable job of rendering the supposed vampyre perfectly innoxious by driving a hedge stake through his body a proceeding which  it was currently believed  inflicted so much physical injury to the frame  as to render his resuscitation out of the question the cries of alarm from below  joined now to the shouts of those mad rioters  produced a scene of dreadful confusion we cannot  for we revolt at the office  describe particularly the dreadful outrage which was committed upon the corpse  suffice it that two or three  maddened by drink  and incited by the others  plunged the hedge stake through the body  and there left it  a sickening and horrible spectacle to any one who might cast his eyes upon it with such violence had the frightful and inhuman deed been committed that the bottom of the coffin was perforated by the stake so that the corpse was actually nailed to its last earthly tenement some asserted  that at that moment an audible groan came from the dead man  and that this arose from the extinguishment of that remnant of life which remained in him  on account of his being a vampyre  and which would have been brought into full existence  if the body had been placed in the rays of the moon  when at its full  according to the popular superstition upon that subject others  again  were quite ready to swear that at the moment the stake was used there was a visible convulsion of all the limbs  and that the countenance  before so placid and so calm  became immediately distorted as if with agony but we have done with these horrible surmises  the dreadful deed has been committed  and wild  ungovernable superstition has had  for a time its sway over the ignorant and debased chapter xlix the mob s arrival at sir francis varney s the attempt to gain admission illustration the soldiery had been sent for from their principal station near the churchyard  and had advanced with some degree of reluctance to quell what they considered as nothing better nor worse than a drunken brawl at a public house  which they really considered they ought not to be called to interfere with when  however  the party reached the spot  and heard what a confusion there was  and saw in what numbers the rioters were assembling  it became evident to them that the case was of a more serious complexion than they had at first imagined  and consequently they felt that their professional dignity was not so much compromised with their interference with the lawless proceedings some of the constabulary of the town were there  and to them the soldiers promised they would hand what prisoners they took  at the same time that they made a distinct condition that they were not to be troubled with their custody  nor in any way further annoyed in the business beyond taking care that they did not absolutely escape  after being once secured this was all that the civil authorities of the town required  and  in fact  they hoped that  after making prisoners of a few of the ringleaders of the riotous proceedings  the rest would disperse  and prevent the necessity of capturing them be it known  however  that both military and civil authorities were completely ignorant of the dreadful outrage against all common decency which had been committed within the public house the door was well guarded  and the question now was how the rioters were to be made to come down stairs  and be captured  and this was likely to remain a question  so long as no means were adopted to make them descend  so that  after a time  it was agreed that a couple of troopers should march up stairs with a constable  to enable him to secure any one who seemed a principal in the riot but this only had the effect of driving those who were in the second floor  and saw the approach of the two soldiers  whom they thought were backed by the whole of their comrades  up a narrow staircase  to a third floor  rather consisting of lofts than of actual rooms  but still  for the time  it was a refuge  and owing to the extreme narrowness of the approach to it  which consisted of nearly a perpendicular staircase  with any degree of tact or method  it might have been admirably defended in the hurry and scramble  all the lights were left behind  and when the two soldiers and constables entered the room where the corpse had lain they became  for the first time  aware of what a horrible purpose had been carried out by the infuriated mob the sight was one of perfect horror  and hardened to scenes which might strike other people as being somewhat of the terrific as these soldiers might be supposed to be by their very profession  they actually sickened at the sight which the mutilated corpse presented  and turned aside with horror these feelings soon gave way to anger and animosity against the crowd who could be guilty of such an atrocious outrage  and  for the first time  a strong and interested vengeance against the mob pervaded the breasts of those who were brought to act against it one of the soldiers ran down stairs to the door  and reported the scene which was to be seen above  a determination was instantly come to  to capture as many as possible of those who had been concerned in so diabolical an outrage  and leaving a guard of five men at the door  the remainder of the party ascended the staircase  determined upon storming the last refuge of the rioters  and dragging them to justice the report  however  of these proceedings that were taking place at the inn  spread quickly over the whole town  and soon as large a mob of the disorderly and the idle as the place could at all afford was assembled outside the inn this mob appeared  for a time  inertly to watch the proceedings  it seemed rather a hazardous thing to interfere with the soldiers  whose carbines look formidable and troublesome weapons with true mob courage  therefore  they left the minority of their comrades  who were within the house  to their fate  and after a whispered conference from one to the other  they suddenly turned in a body  and began to make for the outskirts of the town they then separated  as if by common consent  and straggled out into the open country by twos and threes  consolidating again into a mass when they had got some distance off  and clear of any exertions that could be made by the soldiery to stay them the cry then rose of down with sir francis varney slay him burn his house death to all vampyres  and  at a rapid pace  they proceeded in the direction of his mansion we will leave this mob  however  for the present  and turn our attention to those who are at the inn  and are certainly in a position of some jeopardy  their numbers were not great  and they were unarmed certainly  their best chance would have been to have surrendered at discretion  but that was a measure which  if the sober ones had felt inclined to  those who were infuriated and half maddened with drink would not have acceded to on any account a furious resistance was  therefore  fairly to be expected  and what means the soldiery were likely to use for the purpose of storming this last retreat was a matter of rather anxious conjecture in the case of a regular enemy  there would not  perhaps  have been much difficulty  but here the capture of certain persons  and not their destruction  was the object  and how that was to be accomplished by fair means  certainly was a question which nobody felt very competent to solve determination  however  will do wonders  and although the rioters numbered over forty  notwithstanding all their desertions  and not above seventeen or eighteen soldiers marched into the inn  we shall perceive that they succeeded in accomplishing their object without any manoeuvring at all the space in which the rioters were confined was low  narrow  and inconvenient  as well as dark  for the lights on the staircase cast up that height but very insufficient rays weapons of defence they found but very few  and yet there were some which  to do them but common credit  they used as effectually as possible these attics  or lofts  were used as lumber rooms  and had been so for years  so that there was a collection of old boxes  broken pieces of furniture  and other matters  which will  in defiance of everything and everybody  collect in a house these were formidable means of defence  if not of offence  down a very narrow staircase  had they been used with judgment some of the rioters  who were only just drunk enough to be fool hardy collected a few of these articles at the top of the staircase  and swore they would smash anybody who should attempt to come up to them  a threat easier uttered than executed and besides  after all  if their position had been ever so impregnable they must come down eventually  or be starved out but the soldiers were not at liberty to adopt so slow a process of overcoming their enemy  and up the second floor staircase they went with a determination of making short work of the business they paused a moment  by word of command  on the landing  and then after this slight pause  the word was given to advance now when men will advance  in spite of anything and everything  it is no easy matter to stop them  and he who was foremost among the military would as soon thought of hesitating to ascend the narrow staircase before him  when ordered so to do  as paying the national debt  on he went  and down came a great chest  which  falling against his feet knocked him down as he attempted to scramble over it fire  said the officer  and it appeared that he had made some arrangements as to how the order was to be obeyed  for the second man fired his carbine  and then scrambled over his prostrate comrade  after which he stooped  and the third fired his carbine likewise  and then hurried forward in the same manner at the first sound of the fire arms the rioters were taken completely by surprise  they had not had the least notion of affairs getting to such a length  the smell of the powder  the loud report  and the sensation of positive danger that accompanied these phenomena  alarmed them most terrifically  so that  in point of fact  with the exception of the empty chest that was thrown down in the way of the first soldier  no further idea of defence seemed in any way to find a place in the hearts of the besieged they scrambled one over the other in their eagerness to get as far as possible from immediate danger  which  of course  they conceived existed in the most imminent degree the nearest to the door such was the state of terror into which they were thrown  that each one at the moment believed himself shot  and the soldiers had overcome all the real difficulties in getting possession of what might thus be called the citadel of the inn  before those men who had been so valorous a short time since recovered from the tremendous fright into which they had been thrown we need hardly say that the carbines were loaded  but with blank cartridges  for there was neither a disposition nor a necessity for taking the lives of these misguided people if was the suddenness and the steadiness of the attack that had done all the mischief to their cause  and now  ere they recovered from the surprise of having their position so completely taken by storm  they were handed down stairs  one by one  from soldier to soldier  and into the custody of the civil authorities in order to secure the safe keeping of large a body of prisoners  the constables  who were in a great minority  placed handcuffs upon some of the most capable of resistance  so what with those who were thus secured  and those who were terrified into submission  there was not a man of all the lot who had taken refuge in the attics of the public house but was a prisoner at the sound of fire arms  the women who were outside the inn had  of course  raised a most prodigious clamour they believed directly that every bullet must have done some most serious mischief to the townspeople  and it was only upon one of the soldiers  a non commissioned officer  who was below  assuring them of the innoxious nature of the proceeding which restored anything like equanimity silence  he cried  what are you howling about  do you fancy that we ve nothing better to do than to shoot a parcel of fellows that are not worth the bullets that would be lodged in their confounded carcases but we heard the gun  said a woman of course you did  it s the powder that makes the noise  not the bullet  you ll see them all brought out safe wind and limb this assurance satisfied the women to a certain extent  and such had been their fear that they should have had to look upon the spectacle of death  or of grievous wounds  that they were comparatively quite satisfied when they saw husbands  fathers  and brothers  only in the custody of the town officers and very sheepish some of the fellows looked  when they were handed down and handcuffed  and the more especially when they had been routed only by a few blank cartridges that sixpenny worth of powder had defeated them they were marched off to the town gaol  guarded by the military  who now probably fancied that their night s work was over  and that the most turbulent and troublesome spirits in the town had been secured such  however  was not the case  for no sooner had comparative order been restored  than common observation pointed to a dull red glare in the southern sky in a few more minutes there came in stragglers from the open country shouting fire  fire  with all their might chapter l the mob s arrival at sir francis varney s the attempt to gain admission illustration all eyes were directed towards that southern sky which each moment was becoming more and more illuminated by the lurid appearance bespeaking a conflagration  which if it was not extensive  at all events was raging fiercely there came  too upon the wind  which set from that direction  strange sounds  resembling shouts of triumph  combined occasionally with sharper cries  indicative of alarm with so much system and so quietly had this attack been made upon the house of sir francis varney for the consequences of it now exhibited themselves most unequivocally that no one who had not actually accompanied the expedition was in the least aware that it had been at all undertaken  or that anything of the kind was on the tapis now  however  it could be no longer kept a secret  and as the infuriated mob  who had sought this flagrant means of giving vent to their anger saw the flames from the blazing house rising high in the heavens  they felt convinced that further secrecy was out of the question accordingly  in such cries and shouts as but for caution s sake they would have indulged in from the very first  they now gave utterance to their feelings as regarded the man whose destruction was aimed at death to the vampyre death to the vampyre  was the principal shout and it was uttered in tones which sounded like those of rage and disappointment but it is necessary  now that we have disposed of the smaller number of rioters who committed so serious an outrage at the inn  that we should with some degree of method  follow the proceedings of the larger number who went from the town towards sir francis varney s these persons either had information of a very positive nature  or a very strong suspicion that  notwithstanding the mysterious and most unaccountable disappearance of the vampyre in the old ruin  he would now be found  as usual  at his own residence perhaps one of his own servants may have thus played the traitor to him but however it was  there certainly was an air of confidence about some of the leaders of the tumultuous assemblage that induced a general belief that this time  at least  the vampyre would not escape popular vengeance for being what he was we have before noticed that these people went out of the town at different points  and did not assemble into one mass until they were at a sufficient distance off to be free from all fear of observation then some of the less observant and cautious of them began to indulge in shouts of rage and defiance  but those who placed themselves foremost succeeded in procuring a halt  and one said good friends all  if we make any noise  it can only have one effect and that is  to warn sir francis varney  and enable him to escape  if therefore  we cannot go on quietly  i propose that we return to our homes  for we shall accomplish nothing this advice was sufficiently and evidently reasonable to meet with no dissension  a death like stillness ensued  only broken by some two or three voices saying  in subdued tones that s right that s right  nobody speak come on  then  said he who had given such judicious counsel  and the dark mass of men moved towards sir francis varney s house  as quietly as it was possible for such an assemblage to proceed indeed  saving the sound of the footsteps  nothing could be heard of them at all  and that regular tramp  tramp  would have puzzled any one listening to it from any distance to know in which direction it was proceeding in this way they went on until sir francis varney s house was reached and then a whispered word to halt was given  and all eyes were bent upon the building from but one window out of the numerous ones with which the front of the mansion was studded did there shine the least light  and from that there came rather an uncommonly bright reflection  probably arising from a reading lamp placed close to the window a general impression  they knew not why exactly  seemed to pervade everybody  that in the room from whence streamed that bright light was sir francis varney the vampyre s room  said several  the vampyre s room  that is it yes  said he who had a kind of moral control over his comrades  i have no doubt but he is there what s to be done  asked several make no noise whatever  but stand aside  so as not to be seen from the door when it is opened yes  yes i will knock for admittance  and  the moment it is answered  i will place this stick in such a manner within  that the door cannot be closed again  upon my saying advance  you will make a rush forward  and we shall have possession immediately of the house all this was agreed to  the mob slunk close to the walls of the house and out of immediate observation from the hall door  or from any of the windows  and then the leader advanced  and knocked loudly for admission the silence was now of the most complete character that could be imagined  those who came there so bent upon vengeance were thoroughly convinced of the necessity of extreme caution  to save themselves even yet from being completely foiled they had abundant faith  from experience  of the resources in the way of escape of sir francis varney  and not one among them was there who considered that there was any chance of capturing him  except by surprise  and when once they got hold of him  they determined he should not easily slip through their fingers the knock for admission produced no effect  and  after waiting three or four minutes  it was very provoking to find such a wonderful amount of caution and cunning completely thrown away try again  whispered one well  have patience  i am going to try again the man had the ponderous old fashioned knocker in his hand  and was about to make another appeal to sir francis varney s door  when a strange voice said perhaps you may as well say at once what you want  instead of knocking there to no purpose he gave a start  for the voice seemed to come from the very door itself yet it sounded decidedly human  and  upon a closer inspection  it was seen that a little wicket gate  not larger than a man s face  had been opened from within this was terribly provoking  here was an extent of caution on the part of the garrison quite unexpected  what was to be done well  said the man who appeared at the little opening oh  said he who had knocked  i well i that is to say ahem  is sir francis varney within well i say  is sir francis varney within well  you have said it ah  but you have not answered it no well  is he at home i decline saying  so you had better  all of you  go back to the town again  for we are well provided with all material to resist any attack you may be fools enough to make as he spoke  the servant shut the little square door with a bang that made his questioner jump again  here was a dilemma chapter li the attack upon the vampyre s house the story of the attack the forcing of the doors  and the struggle illustration a council of war was now called among the belligerents  who were somewhat taken aback by the steady refusal of the servant to admit them and their apparent determination to resist all endeavours on the part of the mob to get into and obtain possession of the house  it argued that they were prepared to resist all attempts  and it would cost some few lives to get into the vampyre s house  this passed through the minds of many as they retired behind the angle of the wall where the council was to be held here they looked in each others  face  as if to gather from that the general tone of the feelings of their companions  but here they saw nothing that intimated the least idea of going back as they came it s all very well  mates  to take care of ourselves  you know  began one tall  brawny fellow  but  if we bean t to be sucked to death by a vampyre  why we must have the life out of him ay  so we must jack hodge is right  we must kill him  and there s no sin in it  for he has no right to it  he s robbed some poor fellow of his life to prolong his own ay  ay  that s the way he does  bring him out  i say  then see what we will do with him yes  catch him first  said one  and then we can dispose of him afterwards  i say  neighbours  don t you think it would be as well to catch him first haven t we come on purpose yes  but do it ain t we trying it you will presently  when we come to get into the house well  what s to be done  said one  here we are in a fix  i think  and i can t see our way out very clearly illustration i wish we could get in but how is a question i don t very well see  said a large specimen of humanity the best thing that can be done will be to go round and look over the whole house  and then we may come upon some part where it is far easier to get in at than by the front door but it won t do for us all to go round that way  said one  a small party only should go  else they will have all their people stationed at one point  and if we can divide them  we shall beat them because they have not enough to defend more than one point at a time  now we are numerous enough to make several attacks oh  that s the way to bother them all round  they ll give in  and then the place is our own no  no  said the big countryman  i like to make a good rush and drive all afore us  you know what ye have to do then  and you do it  ye know if you can ay  to be sure  if we can  as you say  but can t we  that s what i want to know to be sure we can then we ll do it  mate that s my mind  we ll do it  come on  and let s have another look at the street door the big countryman left the main body  and resolutely walked up to the main avenue  and approached the door  accompanied by about a dozen or less of the mob  when they came to the door  they commenced knocking and kicking most violently  and assailing it with all kinds of things they could lay their hands upon they continued at this violent exercise for some time perhaps for five minutes  when the little square hole in the door was again opened  and a voice was heard to say you had better cease that kind of annoyance we want to get in it will cost you more lives to do so than you can afford to spare  we are well armed  and are prepared to resist any effort you can make oh  it s all very well  but  an you won t open  why we ll make you that s all about it this was said as the big countryman and his companions were leaving the avenue towards the rest of the body then  take this  as an earnest of what is to follow  said the man  and he discharged the contents of a blunderbuss through the small opening and its report sounded to the rest of the mob like the report of a field piece fortunately for the party retiring the man couldn t take any aim  else it is questionable how many of the party would have got off unwounded as it was  several of them found stray slugs were lodged in various parts of their persons  and accelerated their retreat from the house of the vampyre what luck  inquired one of the mob to the others  as they came back i m afraid you had all the honour ay  ay  we have  and all the lead too  replied a man  as he placed his hand upon a sore part of his person  which bled in consequence of a wound well  what s to be done danged if i know  said one give it up  said another no  no  have him out  i ll never give in while i can use a stick  they are in earnest  and so are we  don t let us be frightened because they have a gun or two they can t have many  and besides  if they have  we are too many for them  besides  we shall all die in our beds hurrah  down with the vampyre so say i  lads  i don t want to be sucked to death when i m a bed better die like a man than such a dog s death as that  and you have no revenge then no  no  he has the better of us then  we ll have him out we ll burn him that s the way we ll do it ay  so we will  only let us get in at that moment a chosen party returned who had been round the house to make a reconnaissance well  well  inquired the mob  what can be done now where can we get in in several places all right  come along then  the place is our own stop a minute  they are armed at all points  and we must make an attack on all points  else we may fail  a party must go round to the front door  and attempt to beat it in  there are plenty of poles and things that could be used for such a purpose there is  besides  a garden door  that opens into the house a kind of parlour  a kitchen door  a window in the flower garden  and an entrance into a store room  this place appears strong  and is therefore unguarded the very point to make an attack not quite why not because it can easily be defended  and rendered useless to us  we must make an attack upon all places but that  and  while they are being at those points  we can then enter at that place  and then you will find them desert the other places when they see us inside hurrah  down with the vampyre  said the mob  as they listened to this advice  and appreciated the plan down with the vampyre now  then  lads  divide  and make the attack  never mind their guns they have but very few  and if you rush in upon them  you will soon have the guns yourselves hurrah  hurrah  shouted the mob the mob now moved away in different bodies  each strong enough to carry the house  they seized upon a variety of poles and stones  and then made for the various doors and windows that were pointed out by those who had made the discovery  each one of those who had formed the party of observation  formed a leader to the others  and at once proceeded to the post assigned him the attack was so sudden and so simultaneous that the servants were unprepared  and though they ran to the doors  and fired away  still they did but little good  for the doors were soon forced open by the enraged rioters  who proceeded in a much more systematic operation  using long heavy pieces of timber which were carried on the shoulders of several men  and driven with the force of battering rams which  in fact  they were against the door bang went the battering ram  crash went the door  and the whole party rushed headlong in  carried forward by their own momentum and fell prostrate  engine and all  into the passage now  then  we have them  exclaimed the servants  who began to belabour the whole party with blows  with every weapon they could secure loudly did the fallen men shout for assistance  and but for their fellows who came rushing in behind  they would have had but a sorry time of it hurrah  shouted the mob  the house is our own not yet  shouted the servants we ll try  said the mob  and they rushed forward to drive the servants back  but they met with a stout resistance  and as some of them had choppers and swords  there were a few wounds given  and presently bang went the blunderbuss two or three of the mob reeled and fell this produced a momentary panic  and the servants then had the whole of the victory to themselves  and were about to charge  and clear the passage of their enemies  when a shout behind attracted their attention that shout was caused by an entrance being gained in another quarter whence the servants were flying  and all was disorder hurrah  hurrah  shouted the mob the servants retreated to the stairs  and here united  they made a stand  and resolved to resist the whole force of the rioters  and they succeeded in doing so  too  for some minutes  blows were given and taken of a desperate character somehow  there were no deadly blows received by the servants  they were being forced and beaten  but they lost no life  this may be accounted for by the fact that the mob used no more deadly weapons than sticks the servants of sir francis varney  on the contrary  were mostly armed with deadly weapons  which  however  they did not use unnecessarily they stood upon the hall steps the grand staircase  with long poles or sticks  about the size of quarter staves  and with these they belaboured those below most unmercifully certainly  the mob were by no means cowards  for the struggle to close with their enemies was as great as ever  and as firm as could well be indeed  they rushed on with a desperation truly characteristic of john bull  and defied the heaviest blows  for as fast as one was stricken down another occupied his place  and they insensibly pressed their close and compact front upon the servants  who were becoming fatigued and harassed fire  again  exclaimed a voice from among the servants the mob made no retrogade movement  but still continued to press onwards  and in another moment a loud report rang through the house  and a smoke hung over the heads of the mob a long groan or two escaped some of the men who had been wounded  and a still louder from those who had not been wounded  and a cry arose of down with the vampyre pull down destroy and burn the whole place down with them all a rush succeeded  and a few more discharges took place  when a shout above attracted the attention of both parties engaged in this fierce struggle  they paused by mutual consent  to look and see what was the cause of that shout chapter lii the interview between the mob and sir francis varney the mysterious disappearance the wine cellars illustration the shout that had so discomposed the parties who were thus engaged in a terrific struggle came from a party above hurrah  hurrah  they shouted a number of times  in a wild strain of delight  hurrah  hurrah  hurrah the fact was  a party of the mob had clambered up a verandah  and entered some of the rooms upstairs  whence they emerged just above the landing near the spot where the servants were resisting in a mass the efforts of the mob hurrah  shouted the mob below hurrah  shouted the mob above there was a momentary pause  and the servants divided themselves into two bodies  and one turned to face those above  and the other those who were below a simultaneous shout was given by both parties of the mob  and a sudden rush was made by both bodies  and the servants of sir francis varney were broken in an instant  they were instantly separated  and knocked about a good bit  but they were left to shift for themselves  the mob had a more important object in view down with the vampyre  they shouted down with the vampyre  shouted they  and they rushed helter skelter through the rooms  until they came to one where the door was partially open  and they could see some person very leisurely seated here he is  they cried who  who the vampire down with him  kill him  burn him hurrah  down with the vampire these sounds were shouted out by a score of voices  and they rushed headlong into the room but here their violence and headlong precipitancy were suddenly restrained by the imposing and quiet appearance of the individual who was there seated the mob entered the room  and there was a sight  that if it did not astonish them  at least  it caused them to pause before the individual who was seated there the room was well filled with furniture  and there was a curtain drawn across the room  and about the middle of it there was a table  behind which sat sir francis varney himself  looking all smiles and courtesy well  dang my smock frock  said one  who d ha  thought of this  he don t seem to care much about it well  i m d d  said another  he seems pretty easy  at all events what is he going to do gentlemen  said sir francis varney  rising  with the blandest smiles pray  gentlemen  permit me to inquire the cause of this condescension on your part  the visit is kind the mob looked at sir francis  and then at each other  and then at sir francis again  but nobody spoke  they were awed by this gentlemanly and collected behaviour if you honour me with this visit from pure affection and neighbourly good will  i thank you down with the vampyre  said one  who was concealed behind the rest and not so much overawed  as he had not seen sir francis sir francis varney rose to his full height  a light gleamed across his features  they were strongly defined then  his long front teeth  too showed most strongly when he smiled  as he did now  and said  in a bland voice gentlemen  i am at your service  permit me to say you are welcome to all i can do for you  i fear the interview will be somewhat inconvenient and unpleasant to you  as for myself  i am entirely at your service as sir francis spoke  he bowed  and folded his hands together  and stepped forwards  but  instead of coming onwards to them  he walked behind the curtain  and was immediately hid from their view down with the vampyre  shouted one down with the vampyre  rang through the apartment  and the mob now not awed by the coolness and courtesy of sir francis  rushed forward and  overturning the table  tore down the curtain to the floor  but  to their amazement  there was no sir francis varney present where is he where is the vampyre where has he gone these were cries that escaped every one s lips  and yet no one could give an answer to them there sir francis varney was not  they were completely thunderstricken they could not find out where he had gone to  there was no possible means of escape  that they could perceive  there was not an odd corner or even anything that could  by any possibility  give even a suspicion that even a temporary concealment could take place they looked over every inch of flooring and of wainscoting  not the remotest trace could be discovered where is he i don t know  said one i can t see where he could have gone  there ain t a hole as big as a keyhole my eye  said one  i shouldn t be at all surprised  if he were to blow up the whole house you don t say go i never heard as how vampyres could do so much as that  they ain t the sort of people  said another but if they can do one thing  they can do another that s very true and what s more  i never heard as how a vampyre could make himself into nothing before  yet he has done so he may be in this room now he may my eyes  what precious long teeth he had yes  and had he fixed one on em in to your arm  he would have drawn every drop of blood out of your body  you may depend upon that  said an old man he was very tall yes  too tall to be any good i shouldn t like him to have laid hold of me  though  tall as he is and then he would have lifted me up high enough to break my neck  when he let me fall the mob routed about the room  tore everything out of its place  and as the object of their search seemed to be far enough beyond their reach their courage rose in proportion  and they shouted and screamed with a proportionate increase of noise and bustle  and at length they ran about mad with rage and vexation  doing all the mischief that was in their power to inflict then they became mischievous  and tore the furniture from its place  and broke it in pieces  and then amused themselves with breaking it up throwing pieces at the pier glasses  in which they made dreadful holes and when that was gone  they broke up the frames every hole and corner of the house was searched  but there was no sir francis varney to be found the cellars  the cellars  shouted a voice the cellars  the cellars  re echoed nearly every pair of lips in the whole place  in another moment  there was crushing and crowding to get down into the cellars hurray  said one  as he knocked off the neck of the bottle that first came to hand here s luck to vampyre hunting  success to our chase so say i  neighbour  but is that your manners to drink before your betters so saying  the speaker knocked the other s elbow  while he was in the act of lifting the wine to his mouth  and thus he upset it over his face and eyes d n it  cried the man  how it makes my eyes smart  dang thee  if i could see  i d ring thy neck success to vampyre hunting  said one may we be lucky yet  said another i wouldn t be luckier than this  said another  as he  too  emptied a bottle  we couldn t desire better entertainment  where the reckoning is all paid excellent very good capital wine this i say  huggins well  said huggins what are you drinking wine what wine danged if i know  was the reply  it s wine  i suppose  for i know it ain t beer nor spirits  so it must be wine are you sure it ain t bottled men s blood eh bottled blood  man  who knows what a vampyre drinks  it may be his wine  he may feast upon that before he goes to bed of a night  drink anybody s health  and make himself cheerful on bottled blood oh  danged  i m so sick  i wish i hadn t taken the stuff  it may be as you say  neighbour  and then we be cannibals or vampyres there s a pretty thing to think of by this time some were drunk  some were partially so  and the remainder were crowding into the cellars to get their share of the wine the servants had now slunk away  they were no longer noticed by the rioters  who  having nobody to oppose them  no longer thought of anything  save the searching after the vampyre  and the destruction of the property  several hours had been spent in this manner  and yet they could not find the object of their search there was not a room  or cupboard  or a cellar  that was capable of containing a cat  that they did not search  besides a part of the rioters keeping a very strict watch on the outside of the house and all about the grounds  to prevent the possibility of the escape of the vampyre there was a general cessation of active hostilities at that moment  a reaction after the violent excitement and exertion they had made to get in  then the escape of their victim  and the mysterious manner in which he got away  was also a cause of the reaction  and the rioters looked in each others  countenances inquiringly above all  the discovery of the wine cellar tended to withdraw them from violent measures  but this could not last long  there must be an end to such a scene  for there never was a large body of men assembled for an evil purpose  who ever were  for any length of time  peaceable to prevent the more alarming effects of drunkenness  some few of the rioters  after having taken some small portion of the wine  became  from the peculiar flavour it possessed  imbued with the idea that it was really blood  and forthwith commenced an instant attack upon the wine and liquors  and they were soon mingling in one stream throughout the cellars this destruction was loudly declaimed against by a large portion of the rioters  who were drinking  but before they could make any efforts to save the liquor  the work of destruction had not only been begun  but was ended  and the consequence was  the cellars were very soon evacuated by the mob chapter liii the destruction of sir francis varney s house by fire the arrival of the military  and a second mob illustration thus many moments had not elapsed ere the feelings of the rioters became directed into a different channel from that in which it had so lately flowed  when urged about the house and grounds for the vampyre  they became impatient and angry at not finding him  many believed that he was yet about the house  while many were of opinion that he had flown away by some mysterious means only possessed by vampyres and such like people fire the house  and burn him out  said one fire the house burn the den  now arose in shouts from all present  and then the mob were again animated by the love of mischief that seemed to be the strongest feelings that animated them burn him out burn him out  were the only words that could be heard from any of the mob  the words ran through the house like wildfire nobody thought of anything else  and all were seen running about in confusion there was no want of good will on the part of the mob to the undertaking  far from it  and they proceeded in the work con amore they worked together with right good will  and the result was soon seen by the heaps of combustible materials that were collected in a short time from all parts of the house all the old dry wood furniture that could be found was piled up in a heap  and to these were added a number of faggots  and also some shavings that were found in the cellar all right  exclaimed one man  in exultation yes  replied a second  all right all right  set light to it  and he will be smoked out if not burned let us be sure that all are out of the house  suggested one of the bystanders ay  ay  shouted several  give them all a chance  search through the house and give them a warning very well  give me the light  and then when i come back i will set light to the fire at once  and then i shall know all is empty  and so will you too this was at once agreed to by all  with acclamations  and the light being handed to the man  he ascended the stairs  crying out in a loud voice come out come out  the house is on fire fire  fire  fire  shouted the mob as a chorus  every now and then at intervals in about ten minutes more  there came a cry of all right  the house is empty  from up the stairs  and the man descended in haste to the hall make haste  lads  and fire away  for i see the red coats are leaving the town hurra  hurra  shouted the infuriated mob  fire fire fire the house burn out the vampyre  burn down the house burn him out  and see if he can stand fire amidst all this tumult there came a sudden blaze upon all around  for the pile had been fired hurra  shouted the mob hurra  and they danced like maniacs round the fire  looking  in fact  like so many wild indians  dancing round their roasting victims  or some demons at an infernal feast the torch had been put to twenty different places  and the flames united into one  and suddenly shot up with a velocity  and roared with a sound that caused many who were present to make a precipitate retreat from the hall this soon became a necessary measure of self preservation  and it required no urging to induce them to quit a place that was burning rapidly and even furiously get the poles and firewood get faggots  shouted some of the mob  and lo  it was done almost by magic  they brought the faggots and wood piled up for winter use  and laid them near all the doors  and especially the main entrance  nay  every gate or door belonging to the outhouses was brought forward and placed upon the fire  which now began to reach the upper stories hurra fire  hurra fire and a loud shout of triumph came from the mob as they viewed the progress of the flames  as they came roaring and tearing through the house doors and the windows each new victory of the element was a signal to the mob for a cheer  and a hearty cheer  too  came from them where is the vampyre now  exclaimed one ha  where is he  said another if he be there  said the man  pointing to the flames  i reckon he s got a warm berth of it  and  at the same time  very little water to boil in his kettle ha  ha  what a funny old man is bob mason  he s always poking fun  he d joke if his wife were dying there is many a true word spoken in jest  suggested another  and  to my mind  bob mason wouldn t be very much grieved if his wife were to die die  said bob  she and i have lived and quarrelled daily a matter of five and thirty years  and  if that ain t enough to make a man sick of being married  and of his wife  hand me  that s all  i say i am tired this was said with much apparent sincerity  and several laughed at the old man s heartiness it s all very well  said the old man  it s all very well to laugh about matters you don t understand  but i know it isn t a joke not a bit on it  i tells you what it is  neighbour  i never made but one grand mistake in all my life and what was that to tie myself to a woman why  you d get married to morrow if your wife were to die to day  said one if i did  i hope i may marry a vampyre  i should have something then to think about  i should know what s o clock  but  as for my old woman lord  lord  i wish sir francis varney had had her for life  i ll warrant when the next natural term of his existence came round again  he wouldn t be in no hurry to renew it  if he did  i should say that vampyres had the happy lot of managing women  which i haven t got no  nor anybody else a loud shout now attracted their attention  and  upon looking in the quarter whence it came  they descried a large body of people coming towards them  from one end of the mob could be seen a long string of red coats the red coats  shouted one the military  shouted another it was plain the military who had been placed in the town to quell disturbances  had been made acquainted with the proceedings at sir francis varney s house  and were now marching to relieve the place  and to save the property they were  as we have stated  accompanied by a vast concourse of people who came out to see what they were going to see  and seeing the flames at sir francis varney s house  they determined to come all the way  and be present the military  seeing the disturbance in the distance  and the flames issuing from the windows  made the best of their way towards the scene of tumult with what speed they could make here they come  said one yes  just in time to see what is done yes  they can go back and say we have burned the vampyre s house down hurra hurra  shouted the mob  in prolonged accents  and it reached the ears of the military the officer urged the men onwards  and they responded to his words  by exerting themselves to step out a little faster oh  they should have been here before this  it s no use  now  they are too late yes  they are too late i wonder if the vampyre can breathe through the smoke  and live in fire  said one i should think he must be able to do so  if he can stand shooting  as we know he can you can t kill a vampyre  but yet he must be consumed if the fire actually touches him  but not unless he can bear almost anything so he can hurra  shouted the mob  as a tall flame shot through the top windows of the house the fire had got the ascendant now  and no hopes could be entertained however extravagant  of saving the smallest article that had been left in the mansion hurra  shouted the mob with the military  who came up with them hurra  shouted the others in reply quick march  said the officer  and then  in a loud  commanding tone he shouted  clear the way  there  clear the way ay  there s room enough for you  said old mason  what are you making so much noise about there was a general laugh at the officer  who took no notice of the words  but ordered his men up before the burning pile  which was now an immense mass of flame the mob who had accompanied the military now mingled with the mob that had set the house of sir francis varney on fire ere the military had come up with them halt  cried out the officer  and the men  obedient to the word of command  halted  and drew up in a double line before the house there were then some words of command issued  and some more given to some of the subalterns  and a party of men  under the command of a sergeant  was sent off from the main body  to make a circuit of the house and grounds the officer gazed for some moments upon the burning pile without speaking  and then  turning to the next in command  he said in low tones  as he looked upon the mob we have come too late yes  much the house is now nearly gutted it is and those who came crowding along with us are inextricably mingled with the others who have been the cause of all this mischief  there s no distinguishing them one from another and if you did  you could not say who had done it  and who had not  you could prove nothing exactly i shall not attempt to take prisoners  unless any act is perpetrated beyond what has been done it is a singular affair very this sir francis varney is represented to be a courteous  gentlemanly man  said the officer no doubt about it  but he s beset by a parcel of people who do not mind cutting a throat if they can get an opportunity of doing so and i expect they will yes  when there is a popular excitement against any man  he had better leave this part at once and altogether  it is dangerous to tamper with popular prejudices  no man who has any value for his life ought to do so  it is a sheer act of suicide chapter liv the burning of varney s house a night scene popular superstition illustration the officer ceased to speak  and then the party whom he had sent round the house and grounds returned  and gained the main body orderly enough and the sergeant went forward to make his report to his superior officer after the usual salutation  he waited for the inquiry to be put to him as to what he had seen well  scott  what have you done i went round the premises  sir  according to your instructions  but saw no one either in the vicinity of the house  or in the grounds around it no strangers  eh no  sir  none you saw nothing at all likely to lead to any knowledge as to who it was that has caused this catastrophe no  sir have you learnt anything among the people who are the perpetrators of this fire no  sir well  then  that will do  unless there is anything else that you can think of nothing further  sir  unless it is that i heard some of them say that sir francis varney has perished in the flames good heavens so i heard  sir that must be impossible  and yet why should it be so  go back  scott and bring me some person who can give me some information upon this point the sergeant departed toward the people  who looked at him without any distrust  for he came single handed  though they thought he came with the intention of learning what they knew of each other  and so stroll about with the intention of getting up accusations against them  but this was not the case  the officer didn t like the work well enough he d rather have been elsewhere illustration at length the sergeant came to one man  whom he accosted  and said to him do you know anything of yonder fire yes  i do know it is a fire yes  and so do i my friend  said the sergeant  when a soldier asks a question he does not expect an uncivil answer but a soldier may ask a question that may have an uncivil end to it he may  but it is easy to say so i do say so  then  now then i ll not trouble you any more the sergeant moved on a pace or two more  and then  turning to the mob he said is there any one among you who can tell me anything concerning the fate of sir francis varney burnt did you see him burnt no  but i saw him in the flames no  before the house was on fire in the house yes  and he has not been seen to leave it since  and we conclude he must have been burned will you come and say as much to my commanding officer  it is all i want shall i be detained no then i will go  said the man  and he hobbled out of the crowd towards the sergeant  i will go and see the officer  and tell him what i know and that is very little  and can prejudice no one hurrah  said the crowd  when they heard this latter assertion  for  at first  they began to be in some alarm lest there should be something wrong about this  and some of them get identified as being active in the fray the sergeant led the man back to the spot  where the officer stood a little way in advance of his men well  scott  he said  what have we here a man who has volunteered a statement  sir oh  well  my man  can you say anything concerning all this disturbance that we have here no  sir then what did you come here for i understood the sergeant to want some one who could speak of sir francis varney well i saw him where in the house exactly  but have you not seen him out of it not since  nor any one else  i believe where was he upstairs  where he suddenly disappeared  and nobody can tell where he may have gone to  but he has not been seen out of the house since  and they say he could not have gone bodily out if they had not seen him he must have been burnt  said the officer  musingly  he could not escape  one would imagine  without being seen by some one out of such a mob oh  dear no  for i am told they placed a watch at every hole  window or door however high  and they saw nothing of him not even fly out fly out  i m speaking of a man and i of a vampire  said the man carelessly a vampyre  pooh  pooh oh no  sir francis varney is a vampyre  there can be no sort of doubt about it  you have only to look at him  and you will soon be satisfied of that  see his great sharp teeth in front  and ask yourself what they are for  and you will soon find the answer  they are to make holes with in the bodies of his victims  through which he can suck their blood the officer looked at the man in astonishment for a few moments  as if he doubted his own ears  and then he said are you serious i am ready to swear to it well  i have heard a great deal about popular superstition  and thought i had seen something of it  but this is decidedly the worst case that ever i saw or heard of  you had better go home  my man  than  by your presence  countenance such a gross absurdity for all that  said the man  sir francis varney is a vampyre a blood sucker a human blood sucker get away with you  said the officer  and do not repeat such folly before any one the man almost jumped when he heard the tone in which this was spoken for the officer was both angry and contemptuous  when he heard the words of the man these people  he added  turning to the sergeant  are ignorant in the extreme  one would think we had got into the country of vampires instead of a civilised community the day was going down now  the last rays of the setting sun glimmered upwards  and still shone upon the tree tops  the darkness of night was still fast closing around them  the mob stood a motley mass of human beings  wedged together  dark and sombre  gazing upon the mischief that had been done the work of their hands  the military stood at ease before the burning pile  and by their order and regularity  presented a contrast to the mob  as strongly by their bright gleaming arms  as by their dress and order the flames now enveloped the whole mansion  there was not a window or a door from which the fiery element did not burst forth in clouds  and forked flames came rushing forth with a velocity truly wonderful the red glare of the flames fell upon all objects around for some distance the more especially so  as the sun had sunk  and a bank of clouds rose from beneath the horizon and excluded all his rays  there was no twilight  and there was  as yet  no moon the country side was enveloped in darkness  and the burning house could be seen for miles around  and formed a rallying point to all men s eyes the engines that were within reach came tearing across the country  and came to the fire  but they were of no avail  there was no supply of water  save from the ornamental ponds  these they could only get at by means that were tedious and unsatisfactory  considering the emergency of the case the house was a lone one  and it was being entirely consumed before they arrived  and therefore there was not the remotest chance of saving the least article  had they ever such a supply of water  nothing could have been effected by it thus the men stood idly by  passing their remarks upon the fire and the mob those who stood around  and within the influence of the red glare of the flames  looked like so many demons in the infernal regions  watching the progress of lighting the fire  which we are told by good christians is the doom of the unfortunate in spirit  and the woefully unlucky in circumstances it was a strange sight that  and there were many persons who would without doubt  have rather been snug by their own fire side than they would have remained there but it happened that no one felt inclined to express his inclination to his neighbour  and  consequently  no one said anything on the subject none would venture to go alone across the fields  where the spirit of the vampyre might  for all they knew to the contrary  be waiting to pounce upon them  and worry them no  no  no man would have quitted that mob to go back alone to the village  they would sooner have stood there all night through  that was an alternative that none of the number would very willingly accept the hours passed away  and the house that had been that morning a noble and well furnished mansion  was now a smouldering heap of ruins  the flames had become somewhat subdued  and there was now more smoke than flames the fire had exhausted itself  there was now no more material that could serve it for fuel  and the flames began to become gradually enough subdued suddenly there was a rush  and then a bright flame shot upward for an instant  so bright and so strong  that it threw a flash of light over the country for miles  but it was only momentary  and it subsided the roof  which had been built strong enough to resist almost anything after being burning for a considerable time  suddenly gave way  and came in with a tremendous crash  and then all was for a moment darkness after this the fire might be said to be subdued  it having burned itself out  and the flames that could now be seen were but the result of so much charred wood  that would probably smoulder away for a day or two if left to itself to do so  a dense mass of smoke arose from the ruins and blackened the atmosphere around  and told the spectators the work was done chapter lv the return of the mob and military to the town the madness of the mob the grocer s revenge illustration on the termination of the conflagration  or  rather  the fall of the roof  with the loss of grandeur in the spectacle  men s minds began to be free from the excitement that chained them to the spot  watching the progress of that element which has been truly described as a very good servant  but a very bad master  and of the truth of this every one must be well satisfied there was now remaining little more than the livid glare of the hot and burning embers  and this did not extend far  for the walls were too strongly built to fall in from their own weight  they were strong and stout  and intercepted the little light the ashes would have given out the mob now began to feel fatigued and chilly  it had been standing and walking about many hours  and the approach of exhaustion could not be put off much longer  especially as there was no longer any great excitement to carry it off the officer  seeing that nothing was to be done  collected his men together  and they were soon seen in motion  he had been ordered to stop any tumult that he might have seen  and to save any property  but there was nothing to do now  all the property that could have been saved was now destroyed  and the mob were beginning to disperse  and creep towards their own houses the order was then given for the men to take close order  and keep together  and the word to march was given  which the men obeyed with alacrity  for they had no good will in stopping there the whole of the night the return to the village of both the mob and the military was not without its vicissitudes  accidents of all kinds were rife amongst them the military  however  taking the open paths  soon diminished the distance  and that  too  with little or no accidents  save such as might have been expected from the state of the fields  after they had been so much trodden down of late not so the townspeople or the peasantry  for  by way of keeping up their spirits  and amusing themselves on their way home  they commenced larking  as they called it  which often meant the execution of practical jokes  and these sometimes were of a serious nature the night was dark at that hour  especially so when there was a number of persons traversing about  so that little or nothing could be seen the mistakes and blunders that were made were numerous  in one place there were a number of people penetrating a path that led only to a hedge and deep ditch  indeed it was a brook very deep and muddy here they came to a stop and endeavoured to ascertain its width  but the little reflected light they had was deceptive  and it did not appear so broad as it was oh  i can jump it  exclaimed one and so can i  said another  i have done so before  and why should i not do so now this was unanswerable  and as there were many present  at least a dozen were eager to jump if thee can do it  i know i can  said a brawny countryman  so i ll do it at once the sooner the better  shouted some one behind  or you ll have no room for a run  here s a lot of em coming up  push over as quickly as you can thus urged  the jumpers at once made a rush to the edge of the ditch and many jumped  and many more  from the prevailing darkness  did not see exactly where the ditch was  and taking one or two steps too many found themselves up above the waist in muddy water nor were those who jumped much better off  for nearly all jumped short or fell backwards into the stream  and were dragged out in a terrible state oh  lord  oh  lord  exclaimed one poor fellow  dripping wet and shivering with cold  i shall die  oh  the rheumatiz  there ll be a pretty winter for me  i m half dead hold your noise  said another  and help me to get the mud out of my eye  i can t see never mind  added a third  considering how you jump  i don t think you want to see this comes a hunting vampyres oh  it s all a judgment  who knows but he may be in the air  it is nothing to laugh at as i shouldn t be surprised if he were  only think how precious pleasant however pleasant it may be to you  remarked one  it s profitable to a good many how so why  see the numbers  of things that will be spoiled  coats torn  hats crushed  heads broken  and shoes burst  oh  it s an ill wind that blows nobody any good so it is  but you may benefit anybody you like  so you don t do it at my expence in one part of a field where there were some stiles and gates  a big countryman caught a fat shopkeeper with the arms of the stile a terrible poke in the stomach  while the breath was knocked out of the poor man s stomach  and he was gasping with agony  the fellow set to laughing  and said to his companions  who were of the same class i say  jim  look at the grocer  he hasn t got any wind to spare  i d run him for a wager  see how he gapes like a fish out of water the poor shopkeeper felt indeed like a fish out of water  and as he afterwards declared he felt just as if he had had a red hot clock weight thrust into the midst of his stomach and there left to cool however  the grocer would be revenged upon his tormentor  who had now lost sight of him  but the fat man  after a time  recovering his wind and the pain in his stomach becoming less intense  he gathered himself up my name ain t jones  he muttered  if i don t be one to his one for that  i ll do something that shall make him remember what it is to insult a respectable tradesman  i ll never forgive such an insult  it is dark  and that s why it is he has dared to do this filled with dire thoughts and a spirit of revenge  he looked from side to side to see with what he could effect his object  but could espy nothing it s shameful  he muttered  what would i give for a little retort i d plaster his ugly countenance as he spoke  he placed his hands on some pales to rest himself  when he found that they stuck to them  the pales had that day been newly pitched a bright idea now struck him if i could only get a handful of this stuff  he thought  i should be able to serve him out for serving me out  i will  cost what it may  i m resolved upon that  i ll not have my wind knocked out  and my inside set on fire for nothing  no  no  i ll be revenged on him with this view he felt over the pales  and found that he could scrape off a little only  but not with his hands  indeed  it only plastered them  he  therefore  marched about for something to scrape it off with ah  i have a knife  a large pocket knife  that will do  that is the sort of thing i want he immediately commenced feeling for it  but had scarcely got his hand into his pocket when he found there would be a great difficulty in either pushing it in further or withdrawing it altogether  for the pitch made it difficult to do either  and his pocket stuck to his hands like a glove d n it  said the grocer  who would have thought of that  here s a pretty go  curse that fellow  he is the cause of all this  i ll be revenged upon him  if it s a year hence the enraged grocer drew his hand out  but was unable to effect his object in withdrawing the knife also  but he saw something shining  he stooped to pick it up  exclaiming as he did so  in a gratified tone of voice ah  here s something that will do better as he made a grasp at it  he found he had inserted his hand into something soft god bless me  what now he pulled his hand hastily away  and found that it stuck slightly  and then he saw what it was ay  ay  the very thing  surely it must have been placed here on purpose by the people the fact was  he had placed his hand into a pot of pitch that had been left by the people who had been at work at pitching the pales  but had been attracted by the fire at sir francis varney s  and to see which they had left their work  and the pitch was left on a smouldering peat fire  so that when mr  jones  the grocer  accidentally put his hand into it he found it just warm when he made this discovery he dabbed his hand again into the pitch pot exclaiming in for a penny  in for a pound and he endeavoured to secure as large a handful of the slippery and sticky stuff as he could  and this done he set off to come up with the big countryman who had done him so much indignity and made his stomach uncomfortable he soon came up with him  for the man had stopped rather behind  and was larking  as it is called  with some men  to whom he was a companion he had slipped down a bank  and was partially sitting down on the soft mud  in his bustle  the little grocer came down with a slide  close to the big countryman ah ah  my little grocer  said the countryman  holding out his hand to catch him  and drawing him towards himself  you will come and sit down by the side of your old friend as he spoke  he endeavoured to pull mr  jones down  too  but that individual only replied by fetching the countryman a swinging smack across the face with the handful of pitch there  take that  and now we are quits  we shall be old friends after this  eh  are you satisfied  you ll remember me  i ll warrant as the grocer spoke  he rubbed his hands over the face of the fallen man  and then rushed from the spot with all the haste he could make the countryman sat a moment or two confounded  cursing  and swearing and spluttering  vowing vengeance  believing that it was mud only that had been plastered over his face  but when he put his hands up  and found out what it was  he roared and bellowed like a town bull he cried out to his companions that his eyes were pitched  but they only laughed at him  thinking he was having some foolish lark with them it was next day before he got home  for he wandered about all night  and it took him a week to wash the pitch off by means of grease  and ever afterwards he recollected the pitching of his face  nor did he ever forget the grocer thus it was the whole party returned a long while after dark across the fields  with all the various accidents that were likely to befal such an assemblage of people the vampyre hunting cost many of them dear  for clothes were injured on all sides  hats lost  and shoes missing in a manner that put some of the rioters to much inconvenience  soon afterwards  the military retired to their quarters  and the townspeople at length became tranquil and nothing more was heard or done that night chapter lvi the departure of the bannerworths from the hall the new abode jack pringle  pilot illustration during that very evening  on which the house of sir francis varney was fired by the mob  another scene  and one of different character  was enacted at bannerworth hall  where the owners of that ancient place were departing from it it was towards the latter part of the day  that flora bannerworth  mrs bannerworth  and henry bannerworth  were preparing themselves to depart from the house of their ancestors  the intended proprietor was  as we have already been made acquainted with  the old admiral  who had taken the place somewhat mysteriously  considering the way in which he usually did business the admiral was walking up and down the lawn before the house  and looking up at the windows every now and then  and turning to jack pringle  he said jack  you dog ay ay  sir mind you convoy these women into the right port  do you hear  and no mistaking the bearings  do you hear ay  ay  sir these crafts want care  and you are pilot  commander  and all  so mind and keep your weather eye open ay  ay  sir  i knows the craft well enough  and i knows the roads  too there ll be no end of foundering against the breakers to find where they lie no  no  jack  you needn t do that  but mind your bearings  jack  mind your bearings never fear  i know em  well enough  my eyes ain t laid up in ordinary yet eh  what do you mean by that  you dog  eh nothing  only i can see without helps to read  or glasses either  so i know one place from another there was now some one moving within  and the admiral  followed by jack pringle  entered the hall  henry bannerworth was there  they were all ready to go when the coach came for them  which the admiral had ordered for them jack  you lubber  where are you ay  ay  sir  here am i go  and station yourself up in some place where you can keep a good look out for the coach  and come and report when you see it ay ay  sir  said jack  and away he went from the room  and stationed himself up in one of the trees  that commanded a good view of the main road for some distance admiral bell  said henry  here we are  trusting implicitly to you and in doing so  i am sure i am doing right you will see that  said the admiral  all s fair and honest as yet and what is to come  will speak for itself i hope you won t suffer from any of these nocturnal visits  said henry i don t much care about them  but old admiral bell don t strike his colours to an enemy  however ugly he may look  no  no  it must be a better craft than his own that ll take him  and one who won t run away but that will grapple yard arm and yard arm  you know why  admiral  you must have seen many dangers in your time  and be used to all kinds of disturbances and conflicts  you have had a life of experience yes  and experience has come pretty thick sometimes  i can tell you when it comes in the shape of frenchmen s broadsides i dare say  then  it must be rather awkward death by the law  said the admiral  to stop one of them with your head  i assure you  i dare not make the attempt myself  though i have often seen it done i dare say  but here are flora and my mother as he spoke  flora and her mother entered the apartment well  admiral  we are all ready  and  though i may feel somewhat sorry at leaving the old hall  yet it arises from attachment to the place  and not any disinclination to be beyond the reach of these dreadful alarms and i  too  shall be by no means sorry  said flora  i am sure it is some gratification to know we leave a friend here  rather than some others  who would have had the place  if they could have got it  by any means ah  that s true enough  miss flora  said the admiral  but we ll run the enemy down yet  depend upon it  but once away  you will be free from these terrors  and now  as you have promised  do not let yourselves be seen any where at all you have our promises  admiral  and they shall be religiously kept  i can assure you boat  ahoy ahoy  shouted jack what boat  said the admiral  surprised  and then he muttered confound you for a lubber  didn t i tell you to mind your bearings  you dog fish you ay  ay  sir and so i did you did yes  here they are  squint over the larboard bulk heads  as they call walls  and then atween the two trees on the starboard side of the course  then straight ahead for a few hundred fathoms  when you come to a funnel as is smoking like the crater of mount vesuvius  and then in a line with that on the top of the hill  comes our boat well  said the admiral  that ll do  now go open the gates  and keep a bright look out  and if you see anybody near your watch  why douse their glim ay ay  sir  said jack  and he disappeared rather a lucid description  said henry  as he thought of jack s report to the admiral oh  it s a seaman s report  i know what he means  it s quicker and plainer than the land lingo  to my ears  and jack can t talk any other you see by this time the coach came into the yard  and the whole party descended into the court yard  where they came to take leave of the old place farewell  admiral good bye  said the admiral  i hope the place you are going to will be such as please you i hope it will i am sure we shall endeavour to be pleased with it  and i am pretty sure we shall good bye farewell  admiral bell  said henry you remember your promises i do  good bye  mr  chillingworth good bye  said mr  chillingworth  who came up to bid them farewell  a pleasant journey  and may you all be the happier for it you do not come with us no  i have some business of importance to attend to  else i should have the greatest pleasure in doing so  but good bye  we shall not be long apart  i dare say i hope not  said henry the door of the carriage was shut by the admiral  who looked round saying jack jack pringle  where are you  you dog here am i  said jack where have you been to only been for pigtail  said jack  i forgot it  and couldn t set sail without it you dog you  didn t i tell you to mind your bearings so i will  said jack  fore and aft fore and aft  admiral you had better  said the admiral  who  however  relaxed into a broad grin  which he concealed from jack pringle jack mounted the coach box  and away it went  just as it was getting dark  the old admiral had locked up all the rooms in the presence of henry bannerworth  and when the coach had gone out of sight  mr chillingworth came back to the hall  where he joined the admiral well  he said  they are gone  admiral bell  and we are alone  we have a clear stage and no favour the two things of all others i most desire  now  they will be strangers where they are going to  and that will be something gained  i will endeavour to do some thing if i get yard arm and yard arm with these pirates  i ll make em feel the weight of true metal  i ll board em d e  i ll do everything everything that can be done ay ay                                    the coach in which the family of the bannerworths were carried away continued its course without any let or hindrance  and they met no one on their road during the whole drive  the fact was  nearly everybody was at the conflagration at sir francis varney s house flora knew not which way they were going  and  after a time  all trace of the road was lost  darkness set in  and they all sat in silence in the coach at length  after some time had been spent thus  flora bannerworth turned to jack pringle  and said are we near  or have we much further to go not very much  ma am  said jack  all s right  however ship in the direct course  and no breakers ahead no lookout necessary  however there s a land lubber aloft to keep a look out as this was not very intelligible  and jack seemed to have his own reasons for silence  they asked him no further questions  but in about three quarters of an hour  during which time the coach had been driving through the trees  they came to a standstill by a sudden pull of the check string from jack  who said hilloa take in sails  and drop anchor is this the place yes  here we are  said jack  we re in port now  at all events  and he began to sing     the trials and the dangers of the voyage is past when the coach door opened  and they all got out and looked about them where they were up the garden if you please  ma am as quick as you can  the night air is very cold flora and her mother and brother took the hint  which was meant by jack to mean that they were not to be seen outside  they at once entered a pretty garden  and then they came to a very neat and picturesque cottage  they had no time to look up at it  as the door was immediately opened by an elderly female  who was intended to wait upon them soon after  jack pringle and the coachman entered the passage with the small amount of luggage which they had brought with them  this was deposited in the passage  and then jack went out again  and  after a few minutes  there was the sound of wheels  which intimated that the coach had driven off jack  however  returned in a few minutes afterwards  having secured the wicket gate at the end of the garden  and then entered the house shutting the door carefully after him flora and her mother looked over the apartments in which they were shown with some surprise  it was  in everything  such as they could wish indeed  though it could not be termed handsomely or extravagantly furnished  or that the things were new  yet  there was all that convenience and comfort could require  and some little of the luxuries well  said flora  this is very thoughtful of the admiral  the place will really be charming  and the garden  too  delightful mustn t be made use of just now  said jack  if you please  ma am them s the orders at present very well  said flora  smiling  i suppose  mr  pringle  we must obey them jack pringle  if you please  said jack  my commands only temporary  i ain t got a commission chapter lvii the lonely watch  and the adventure in the deserted house illustration it is now quite night  and so peculiar and solemn a stillness reigns in and about bannerworth hall and its surrounding grounds  that one might have supposed it a place of the dead  deserted completely after sunset by all who would still hold kindred with the living  there was not a breath of air stirring  and this circumstance added greatly to the impression of profound repose which the whole scene exhibited the wind during the day had been rather of a squally character  but towards nightfall  as is often usual after a day of such a character  it had completely lulled  and the serenity of the scene was unbroken even by the faintest sigh from a wandering zephyr the moon rose late at that period  and as is always the case at that interval between sunset and the rising of that luminary which makes the night so beautiful  the darkness was of the most profound character it was one of those nights to produce melancholy reflections a night on which a man would be apt to review his past life  and to look into the hidden recesses of his soul to see if conscience could make a coward of him in the loneliness and stillness that breathed around it was one of those nights in which wanderers in the solitude of nature feel that the eye of heaven is upon them  and on which there seems to be a more visible connection between the world and its great creator than upon ordinary occasions the solemn and melancholy appear places once instinct with life  when deserted by those familiar forms and faces that have long inhabited them  there is no desert  no uninhabited isle in the far ocean  no wild barren  pathless tract of unmitigated sterility  which could for one moment compare in point of loneliness and desolation to a deserted city strip london  mighty and majestic as it is  of the busy swarm of humanity that throng its streets  its suburbs  its temples  its public edifices  and its private dwellings  and how awful would be the walk of one solitary man throughout its noiseless thoroughfares illustration if madness seized not upon him ere he had been long the sole survivor of a race  it would need be cast in no common mould and to descend from great things to smaller from the huge leviathan city to one mansion far removed from the noise and bustle of conventional life  we may imagine the sort of desolation that reigned through bannerworth hall  when  for the first time  after nearly a hundred and fifty years of occupation  it was deserted by the representatives of that family  so many members of which had lived and died beneath its roof  the house  and everything within  without  and around it  seemed actually to sympathize with its own desolation and desertion it seemed as if twenty years of continued occupation could not have produced such an effect upon the ancient edifice as had those few hours of neglect and desertion and yet it was not as if it had been stripped of those time worn and ancient relics of ornament and furnishing that so long had appertained to it  no  nothing but the absence of those forms which had been accustomed quietly to move from room to room  and to be met here upon a staircase  there upon a corridor  and even in some of the ancient panelled apartments  which give it an air of dreary repose and listlessness the shutters  too  were all closed  and that circumstance contributed largely to the production of that gloomy effect which otherwise could not have ensued in fact  what could be done without attracting very special observation was done to prove to any casual observer that the house was untenanted but such was not really the case  in that very room where the much dreaded varney the vampyre had made one of his dreaded appearances to flora bannerworth and her mother  sat two men it was from that apartment that flora had discharged the pistol  which had been left to her by her brother  and the shot from which it was believed by the whole family had most certainly taken effect upon the person of the vampyre it was a room peculiarly accessible from the gardens  for it had long french windows opening to the very ground  and but a stone step intervened between the flooring of the apartment and a broad gravel walk which wound round that entire portion of the house it was in this room  then  that two men sat in silence  and nearly in darkness before them  and on a table  were several articles of refreshment  as well of defence and offence  according as their intentions might be there were a bottle and three glasses  and lying near the elbow of one of the men was a large pair of pistols  such as might have adorned the belt of some desperate character  who wished to instil an opinion of his prowess into his foes by the magnitude of his weapons close at hand  by the same party  lay some more modern fire arms  as well as a long dirk  with a silver mounted handle the light they had consisted of a large lantern  so constructed with a slide  that it could be completely obscured at a moment s notice  but now as it was placed  the rays that were allowed to come from it were directed as much from the window of the apartment  as possible  and fell upon the faces of the two men  revealing them to be admiral bell and dr chillingworth it might have been the effect of the particular light in which he sat but the doctor looked extremely pale  and did not appear at all at his ease the admiral  on the contrary  appeared in as placable a state of mind as possible and had his arms folded across his breast  and his head shrunk down between his shoulders as if he had made up his mind to something that was to last a long time  and  therefore he was making the best of it i do hope  said mr  chillingworth  after a long pause  that our efforts will be crowned with success you know  my dear sir  that i have always been of your opinion  that there was a great deal more in this matter than met the eye to be sure  said the admiral  and as to our efforts being crowned with success  why  i ll give you a toast  doctor  may the morning s reflection provide for the evening s amusement ha  ha  said chillingworth  faintly  i d rather not drink any more and you seem  admiral  to have transposed the toast in some way  i believe it runs  may the evening s amusement bear the morning s reflection transpose the devil  said the admiral  what do i care how it runs  i gave you my toast  and as to that you mention  it s another one altogether  and a sneaking  shore going one too  but why don t you drink why  my dear sir  medically speaking  i am strongly of opinion that when the human stomach is made to contain a large quantity of alcohol it produces bad effects upon the system  now  i ve certainly taken one glass of this infernally strong hollands  and it is now lying in my stomach like the red hot heater of a tea urn is it  put it out with another  then ay  i m afraid that would not answer  but do you really think  admiral that we shall effect anything by waiting here  and keeping watch and ward  not under the most comfortable circumstances  this first night of the hall being empty well  i don t know that we shall  said the admiral  but when you really want to steal a march upon the enemy  there is nothing like beginning betimes  we are both of opinion that varney s great object throughout has been  by some means or another  to get possession of the house yes  true  true we know that he has been unceasing in his endeavours to get the bannerworth family out of it  that he has offered them their own price to become its tenant  and that the whole gist of his quiet and placid interview with flora in the garden  was to supply her with a new set of reasons for urging her mother and brother to leave bannerworth hall because the old ones were certainly not found sufficient true  true  most true  said mr  chillingworth  emphatically  you know  sir  that from the first time you broached that view of the subject to me  how entirely i coincided with you of course you did  for you are a honest fellow  and a right thinking fellow  though you are a doctor  and i don t know that i like doctors much better than i like lawyers they re only humbugs in a different sort of way  but i wish to be liberal  there is such a thing as an honest lawyer  and  d e  you re an honest doctor of course i m much obliged  admiral  for your good opinion  i only wish it had struck me to bring something of a solid nature in the shape of food  to sustain the waste of the animal economy during the hours we shall have to wait here don t trouble yourself about that  said the admiral  do you think i m a donkey  and would set out on a cruise without victualling my ship  i should think not  jack pringle will be here soon  and he has my orders to bring in something to eat well  said the doctor  that s very provident of you  admiral  and i feel personally obliged  but tell me  how do you intend to conduct the watch what do you mean why  i mean  if we sit here with the window fastened so as to prevent our light from being seen  and the door closed  how are we by any possibility to know if the house is attacked or not hark ee  my friend  said the admiral  i ve left a weak point for the enemy a what  admiral a weak point  i ve taken good care to secure everything but one of the windows on the ground floor  and that i ve left open  or so nearly open that it will look like the most natural place in the world to get in at now  just inside that window  i ve placed a lot of the family crockery i ll warrant  if anybody so much as puts his foot in  you ll hear the smash and  d e  there it is there was a loud crash at this moment  followed by a succession of similar sounds  but of a lesser degree  and both the admiral and mr chillingworth sprung to their feet come on  cried the former  here ll be a precious row take the lantern mr  chillingworth did so  but he did not seem possessed of a great deal of presence of mind  for  before they got out of the room  he twice accidentally put on the dark slide  and produced a total darkness d n  said the admiral  don t make it wink and wink in that way  hold it up  and run after me as hard as you can i m coming  i m coming  said mr  chillingworth it was one of the windows of a long room  containing five  fronting the garden  which the admiral had left purposely unguarded  and it was not far from the apartment in which they had been sitting  so that probably  not half a minute s time elapsed between the moment of the first alarm  and their reaching the spot from whence it was presumed to arise the admiral had armed himself with one of the huge pistols  and he dashed forward  with all the vehemence of his character  towards the window  where he knew he had placed the family crockery  and where he fully expected to meet the reward of his exertion by discovering some one lying amid its fragments in this  however  he was disappointed  for  although there was evidently a great smash amongst the plates and dishes  the window remained closed and there was no indication whatever of the presence of any one well  that s odd  said the admiral  i balanced them up amazingly careful  and two of em edgeways d e  a fly would have knocked them down mew  said  a great cat  emerging from under a chair curse you  there you are  said the admiral  put out the light  put out the light  here we re illuminating the whole house for nothing with  a click went the darkening slide over the lantern  and all was obscurity at that instant a shrill  clear whistle came from the garden chapter lviii the arrival of jack pringle midnight and the vampyre the mysterious hat illustration bless me  what is that  said mr  chillingworth  what a very singular sound hold your noise  said the admiral  did you never hear that before no  how should i lor  bless the ignorance of some people  that s a boatswain s call oh  it is  said mr  chillingworth  is he going to call again d e  i tell ye it s a boatswain s call well  then  d e  if it comes to that  said mr  chillingworth  what does he call here for the admiral disdained an answer  but demanding the lantern  he opened it  so that there was a sufficient glimmering of light to guide him  and then walked from the room towards the front door of the hall he asked no questions before he opened it  because  no doubt  the signal was preconcerted  and jack pringle  for it was he indeed who had arrived  at once walked in  and the admiral barred the door with the same precision with which it was before secured well  jack  he said  did you see anybody ay  ay  sir  said jack why  ye don t mean that where where i bought the grub  a woman d e  you re a fool  jack you re another hilloa  ye scoundrel  what d ye mean by talking to me in that way  is this your respect for your superiors ship s been paid off long ago  said jack  and i ain t got no superiors  i ain t a marine or a frenchman why  you re drunk i know it  put that in your eye there s a scoundrel  why  you know nothing lubber  didn t i tell you to be careful  and that everything depended upon secrecy and caution  and didn t i tell you  above all this  to avoid drink to be sure you did and yet you come here like a rum cask yes  now you ve had your say  what then you d better leave him alone  said mr  chillingworth  it s no use arguing with a drunken man harkye  admiral  said jack  steadying himself as well as he could i ve put up with you a precious long while  but i won t no longer you re so drunk  now  that you keeping bobbing up and down like the mizen gaff in a storm that s my opinion tol de rol let him alone  let him alone  urged mr  chillingworth the villain  said the admiral  he s enough to ruin everything  now who would have thought that  but it s always been the way with him for a matter of twenty years he never had any judgment in his drink  when it was all smooth sailing  and nothing to do  and the fellow might have got an extra drop on board  which nobody would have cared for  he s as sober as a judge  but  whenever there s anything to do  that wants a little cleverness  confound him  he ships rum enough to float a seventy four are you going to stand anything to drink  said jack  my old buffer do you recollect where you got your knob scuttled off beyrout how you fell on your latter end and tried to recollect your church cateckis  you old brute i s ashamed of you  do you recollect the brown girl you bought for thirteen bob and a tanner  at the blessed society islands and sold her again for a dollar  to a nigger seven feet two  in his natural pumps  you re a nice article  you is  to talk of marines and swabs  and shore going lubbers  blow yer  do you recollect the little frenchman that told ye he d pull your blessed nose  and i advised you to soap it  do you recollect sall at spithead  as you got in at a port hole of the state cabin  all but her behind death and the devil  said the admiral  breaking from the grasp of mr chillingworth ay  said jack  you ll come to em both one of these days  old cock and no mistake i ll have his life  i ll have his life  roared the admiral nay  nay  sir  said mr  chillingworth  catching the admiral round the waist  my dear sir  recollect  now  if i may venture to advise you admiral bell  there s a lot of that fiery hollands you know  in the next room  set firm down to that  and finish him off  i ll warrant him  he ll be quiet enough what s that you say  cried jack hollands who s got any next to rum and elizabeth baker  if i has an affection  it s hollands jack  said the admiral ay  ay  sir  said jack  instinctively come this way jack staggered after him  and they all reached the room where the admiral and mr  chillingworth had been sitting before the alarm there  said the admiral  putting the light upon the table  and pointing to the bottle  what do you think of that i never thinks under such circumstances  said jack  here s to the wooden walls of old england he seized the bottle  and  putting its neck into his mouth  for a few moments nothing was heard but a gurgling sound of the liquor passing down his throat  his head went further and further back  until  at last over he went  chair and bottle and all  and lay in a helpless state of intoxication on the floor so far  so good  said the admiral  he s out of the way  at all events i ll just loosen his neckcloth  said mr  chillingworth  and then we ll go and sit somewhere else  and i should recommend that  if anywhere  we take up our station in that chamber  once flora s  where the mysterious panelled portrait hangs  that bears so strong a resemblance to varney  the vampyre hush  said the admiral  what s that they listened for a moment intently  and then  distinctly  upon the gravel path outside the window  they heard a footstep  as if some person were walking along  not altogether heedlessly  but yet without any very great amount of caution or attention to the noise he might make hist  said the doctor  not a word  they come what do you say they for  said the admiral because something seems to whisper me that mr  marchdale knows more of varney  the vampyre  than ever he has chosen to reveal  put out the light yes  yes that ll do  the moon has risen  see how it streams through the chinks of the shutters no  no it s not in that direction  or our light would have betrayed us  do you not see the beams come from that half glass door leading to the greenhouse yes  and there s the footstep again  or another tramp  tramp came a footfall again upon the gravel path  and  as before died away upon their listening ears what do you say now  said mr  chillingworth are there not two if they were a dozen  said the admiral  although we have lost one of our force  i would tackle them  let s creep on through the rooms in the direction the footsteps went my life on it  said mr  chillingworth as they left the apartment  if this be varney  he makes for that apartment where flora slept  and which he knows how to get admission to  i ve studied the house well  admiral and to get to that window any one from here outside must take a considerable round  come on we shall be beforehand a good idea a good idea  be it so just allowing themselves sufficient light to guide them on the way from the lantern  they hurried on with as much precipitation as the intricacies of the passage would allow  nor halted till they had reached the chamber were hung the portrait which bore so striking and remarkable a likeness to varney  the vampyre they left the lamp outside the door  so that not even a straggling beam from it could betray that there were persons on the watch  and then  as quietly as foot could fall  they took up their station among the hangings of the antique bedstead  which has been before alluded to in this work as a remarkable piece of furniture appertaining to that apartment do you think  said the admiral  we ve distanced them certainly we have  it s unlucky that the blind of the window is down is it  by heaven  there s a d d strange looking shadow creeping over it mr  chillingworth looked almost with suspended breath  even he could not altogether get rid of a tremulous feeling  as he saw that the shadow of a human form  apparently of very large dimensions  was on the outside with the arms spread out  as if feeling for some means of opening the window it would have been easy now to have fired one of the pistols direct upon the figure  but  somehow or another  both the admiral and mr chillingworth shrank from that course  and they felt much rather inclined to capture whoever might make his appearance  only using their pistols as a last resource  than gratuitously and at once to resort to violence who should you say that was  whispered the admiral varney  the vampyre d e  he s ill looking and big enough for anything there s a noise there was a strange cracking sound at the window  as if a pane of glass was being very stealthily and quietly broken  and then the blind was agitated slightly  confusing much the shadow that was cast upon it  as if the hand of some person was introduced for the purpose of effecting a complete entrance into the apartment he s coming in  whispered the admiral hush  for heaven s sake  said mr  chillingworth  you will alarm him and we shall lose the fruit of all the labour we have already bestowed upon the matter  but did you not say something  admiral  about lying under the window and catching him by the leg why  yes  i did go and do it  then  for  as sure as you are a living man  his leg will be in in a minute here goes  said the admiral  i never suggest anything which i m unwilling to do myself whoever it was that now was making such strenuous exertions to get into the apartment seemed to find some difficulty as regarded the fastenings of the window  and as this difficulty increased  the patience of the party  as well as his caution deserted him  and the casement was rattled with violence with a far greater amount of caution than any one from a knowledge of his character would have given him credit for  the admiral crept forward and laid himself exactly under the window the depth of wood work from the floor to the lowest part of the window frame did not exceed above two feet  so that any one could conveniently step in from the balcony outride on to the floor of the apartment  which was just what he who was attempting to effect an entrance was desirous of doing it was quite clear that  be he who he might  mortal or vampyre  he had some acquaintance with the fastening of the window  for now he succeeded in moving it  and the sash was thrown open the blind was still an obstacle  but a vigorous pull from the intruder brought that down on the prostrate admiral  and then mr  chillingworth saw  by the moonlight  a tall  gaunt figure standing in the balcony  as if just hesitating for a moment whether to get head first or feet first into the apartment had he chosen the former alternative he would need  indeed  to have been endowed with more than mortal powers of defence and offence to escape capture  but his lucky star was in the ascendancy  and he put his foot in first he turned his side to the apartment and  as he did so  the blight moonlight fell upon his face  enabling mr  chillingworth to see  without the shadow of a doubt  that it was  indeed  varney  the vampyre  who was thus stealthily making his entrance into bannerworth hall  according to the calculation which had been made by the admiral upon that subject the doctor scarcely knew whether to be pleased or not at this discovery it was almost a terrifying one  sceptical as he was upon the subject of vampyres  and he waited breathless for the issue of the singular and perilous adventure no doubt admiral bell deeply congratulated himself upon the success which was about to crown his stratagem for the capture of the intruder be he who he might  and he writhed with impatience for the foot to come sufficiently near him to enable him to grasp it his patience was not severely tried  for in another moment it rested upon his chest boarders a hoy  shouted the admiral  and at once he laid hold of the trespasser  yard arm to yard arm  i think i ve got you now  here s a prize  doctor  he shall go away without his leg if he goes away now  eh what  the light d e  he has doctor  the light  the light  why what s this hilloa  there dr  chillingworth sprang into the passage  and procured the light in another moment he was at the side of the admiral  and the lantern slide being thrown back  he saw at once the dilemma into which his friend had fallen there he lay upon his back  grasping  with the vehemence of an embrace that had in it much of the ludicrous  a long boot  from which the intruder had cleverly slipped his leg  leaving it as a poor trophy in the hands of his enemies why you ve only pulled his boot off  said the doctor  and now he s gone for good  for he knows what we re about  and has slipped through your fingers admiral bell sat up and looked at the boot with a rueful countenance done again  he said yes  you are done  said the doctor  why didn t you lay hold of the leg while you were about it  instead of the boot  admiral  are these your tactics don t be a fool  said the admiral  put out the light and give me the pistols  or blaze away yourself into the garden  a chance shot may do something  it s no use running after him  a stern chase is a long chase but fire away as if some parties below had heard him give the word  two loud reports from the garden immediately ensued  and a crash of glass testified to the fact that some deadly missile had entered the room murder  said the doctor  and he fell flat upon his back  i don t like this at all  it s all in your line  admiral  but not in mine all s right  my lad  said the admiral  now for it he saw lying in the moonlight the pistols which he and the doctor had brought into the room  and in another moment he  to use his own words returned the broadside of the enemy d n it  he said  this puts me in mind of old times  blaze away  you thieves  while i load  broadside to broadside  it s your turn now  i scorn to take an advantage  what the devil s that something very large and very heavy came bang against the window sending it all into the room  and nearly smothering the admiral with the fragments  another shot was then fired  and in came something else which hit the wall on the opposite side of the room  rebounding from thence on to the doctor  who gave a yell of despair after that all was still  the enemy seemed to be satisfied that they had silenced the garrison  and it took the admiral a great deal of kicking and plunging to rescue himself from some superincumbent mass that was upon him  which seemed to him to be a considerable sized tree call this fair fighting  he shouted getting a man s legs and arms tangled up like a piece of indian matting in the branches of a tree doctor  i say  hilloa  where are you i don t know  said the doctor  but there s somebody getting into the balcony now we shall be murdered in cold blood where s the pistols fired off  of course  you did it yourself bang came something else into the room  which  from the sound it made closely resembled a brick  and after that somebody jumped clean into the centre of the floor  and then  after rolling and writhing about in a most singular manner  slowly got up  and with various preliminary hiccups  said come on  you lubbers  many of you as like  i m the tar for all weathers why  d e  said the admiral  it s jack pringle yes  it is  said jack  who was not sufficiently sober to recognise the admiral s voice  i sees as how you ve heard of me  come on  all of you why  jack  you scoundrel  roared the admiral  how came you here don t you know me  i m your admiral  you horse marine eh  said jack  ay ay  sir  how came you here how came you  you villain boarded the enemy the enemy who you boarded was us  and hang me if i don t think you haven t been pouring broadsides into us  while the enemy were scudding before the wind in another direction lor  said jack explain  you scoundrel  directly explain well  that s only reasonable  said jack  and giving a heavier lurch than usual  he sat down with a great bounce upon the floor  you see it s just this here when i was a coming of course i heard  just as i was a going  that ere as made me come all in consequence of somebody a going  or for to come  you see  admiral doctor  cried the admiral  in a great rage  just help me out of this entanglement of branches  and i ll rid the world from an encumbrance by smashing that fellow smash yourself  said jack  you know you re drunk my dear admiral  said mr  chillingworth  laying hold of one of his legs  and pulling it very hard  which brought his face into a lot of brambles  we re making a mess of this business murder  shouted the admiral  you are indeed  is that what you call pulling me out of it  you ve stuck me fast i ll manage it  said jack  i ve seed him in many a scrape  and i ve seed him out  you pull me  doctor  and i ll pull him  yo hoy jack laid hold of the admiral by the scuff of the neck  and the doctor laid hold of jack round the waist  the consequence of which was that he was dragged out from the branches of the tree  which seemed to have been thrown into the room  and down fell both jack and the doctor at this instant there was a strange hissing sound heard below the window  then there was a sudden  loud report  as if a hand grenade had gone off  a spectral sort of light gleamed into the room  and a tall gaunt looking figure rose slowly up in the balcony beware of the dead  said a voice  let the living contend with the living  the dead with the dead  beware the figure disappeared  as did also the strange  spectral looking light a death like silence ensued  and the cold moonbeams streamed in upon the floor of the apartment  as if nothing had occurred to disturb the wrapped repose and serenity of the scene chapter lix the warning the new plan of operation the insulting message from varney illustration so much of the night had been consumed in these operations  that by the time they were over  and the three personages who lay upon the floor of what might be called the haunted chamber of bannerworth hall  even had they now been disposed to seek repose  would have had a short time to do so before the daylight would have streamed in upon them  and roused them to the bustle of waking existence it may be well believed what a vast amount of surprise came over the three persons in that chamber at the last little circumstance that had occurred in connection with the night s proceedings there was nothing which had preceded that  that did not resemble a genuine attack upon the premises  but about that last mysterious appearance  with its curious light  there was quite enough to bother the admiral and jack pringle to a considerable effect  whatever might be the effect upon mr  chillingworth  whose profession better enabled him to comprehend  chemically  what would produce effects that  no doubt astonished them amazingly what with his intoxication and the violent exercise he had taken  jack was again thoroughly prostrate  while the admiral could not have looked more astonished had the evil one himself appeared in propria persona and given him notice to quit the premises he was  however  the first to speak  and the words he spoke were addressed to jack  to whom he said jack  you lubber  what do you think of all that jack  however  was too far gone even to say ay  ay  sir  and mr chillingworth  slowly getting himself up to his feet  approached the admiral it s hard to say so much  admiral bell  he said  but it strikes me that whatever object this sir francis varney  or varney  the vampyre has in coming into bannerworth hall  it is  at all events  of sufficient importance to induce him to go any length  and not to let even a life to stand in the way of its accomplishment well  it seems so  said the admiral  for i ll be hanged if i can make head or tail of the fellow if we value our personal safety  we shall hesitate to continue a perilous adventure which i think can end only in defeat  if not in death but we don t value our personal safety  said the admiral  we ve got into the adventure  and i don t see why we shouldn t carry it out  it may be growing a little serious  but what of that  for the sake of that young girl  flora bannerworth  as well as for the sake of my nephew charles holland  i will see the end of this affair  let it be what it may  but mind you  mr  chillingworth  if one man chooses to go upon a desperate service  that s no reason why he should ask another to do so i understand you  said mr  chillingworth  but  having commenced the adventure with you  i am not the man to desert you in it  we have committed a great mistake a mistake  how why  we ought to have watched outside the house  instead of within it there can be no doubt that if we had lain in wait in the garden  we should have been in a better position to have accomplished our object well  i don t know  doctor  but it seems to me that if jack pringle hadn t made such a fool of himself  we should have managed very well and i don t know now how he came to behave in the manner he did nor i  said mr  chillingworth  but  at all events  so far as the result goes  it is quite clear that any further watching  in this house for the appearance of sir francis varney  will now be in vain  he has nothing to do now but to keep quiet until we are tired out a fact concerning which he can easily obtain information and then he immediately  without trouble  walks into the premises  to his own satisfaction but what the deuce can he want upon the premises that question  admiral  induces me to think that we have made another mistake  we ought not to have attempted to surprise sir francis varney in coming into bannerworth hall  but to catch him as he came out illustration well  there s something in that  said the admiral  this is a pretty night s business  to be sure  however  it can t be helped  it s done and there s an end on t  and now  as the morning is near at hand  i certainly must confess i should like to get some breakfast  although i don t like that we should all leave the house together why  said mr  chillingworth  as we have now no secret to keep with regard to our being here  because the principal person we wished to keep it from is aware of it  i think we cannot do better than send at once for henry bannerworth  tell him of the non success of the effort we have made in his behalf  and admit him at once into our consultation of what is next to be done agreed  agreed  i think that  without troubling him  we might have captured this varney  but that s over now  and  as soon as jack pringle chooses to wake up again  i ll send him to the bannerworths with a message ay  ay  sir  said jack  suddenly  all s right why  you vagabond  said the admiral  i do believe you ve been shamming shamming what being drunk  to be sure lor  couldn t do it  said jack  i ll just tell you how it was  i wakened up and found myself shut in somewhere  and  as i couldn t get out of the door  i thought i d try the window  and there i did get out well  perhaps i wasn t quite the thing  but i sees two people in the garden a looking up at this ere room  and  to be sure  i thought it was you and the doctor  well  it warn t no business of mine to interfere  so i seed one of you climb up the balcony  as i thought  and then  after which  come down head over heels with such a run  that i thought you must have broken your neck  well  after that you fired a couple of shots in  and then  after that  i made sure it was you  admiral and what made you make sure of that why  because you scuttled away like an empty tar barrel in full tide confound you  you scoundrel well  then  confound you  if it comes to that  i thought i was doing you good sarvice  and that the enemy was here  when all the while it turned out as you was and the enemy wasn t  and the enemy was outside and you wasn t but who threw such a confounded lot of things into the room why  i did  of course  i had but one pistol  and  when i fired that off  i was forced to make up a broadside with what i could was there ever such a stupid  said the admiral  doctor  doctor  you talked of us making two mistakes  but you forgot a third and worse one still  and that was the bringing such a lubberly son of a sea cook into the place as this fellow you re another  said jack  and you knows it well  well  said mr  chillingworth  it s no use continuing it admiral  jack  in his way  did  i dare say  what he considered for the best i wish he d do  then  what he considers for the worst  next time perhaps i may  said jack  and then you will be served out above a bit  what ud become of you  i wonder  if it wasn t for me  i m as good as a mother to you  you knows that  you old babby come  come  admiral  said mr  chillingworth  come down to the garden gate  it is now just upon daybreak  and the probability is that we shall not be long there before we see some of the country people  who will get us anything we require in the shape of refreshment  and as for jack  he seems quite sufficiently recovered now to go to the bannerworths oh  i can go  said jack  as for that  the only thing as puts me out of the way is the want of something to drink  my constitution won t stand what they call temperance living  or nothing with the chill off go at once  said the admiral  and tell mr  henry bannerworth that we are here  but do not tell him before his sister or his mother  if you meet anybody on the road  send them here with a cargo of victuals  it strikes me that a good  comfortable breakfast wouldn t be at all amiss doctor how rapidly the day dawns  remarked mr  chillingworth  as he walked into the balcony from whence varney  the vampire  had attempted to make good his entrance to the hall just as he spoke  and before jack pringle could get half way over to the garden gate  there came a tremendous ring at the bell which was suspended over it a view of that gate could not be commanded from the window of the haunted apartment  so that they could not see who it was that demanded admission as jack pringle was going down at any rate  they saw no necessity for personal interference  and he proved that there was not  by presently returning with a note which he said had been thrown over the gate by a lad  who then scampered off with all the speed he could make the note  exteriorly  was well got up  and had all the appearance of great care having been bestowed upon its folding and sealing it was duly addressed to admiral bell  bannerworth hall  and the word immediate  was written at one corner the admiral  after looking at it for some time with very great wonder came at last to the conclusion that probably to open it would be the shortest way of arriving at a knowledge of who had sent it  and he accordingly did so the note was as follows     my dear sir feeling assured that you cannot be surrounded     with those means and appliances for comfort in the hall  in its     now deserted condition  which you have a right to expect  and so     eminently deserve  i flatter myself that i shall receive an     answer in the affirmative  when i request the favour of your     company to breakfast  as well as that of your learned friend     mr  chillingworth     in consequence of a little accident which occurred last evening     to my own residence  i am  ad interim  until the county build     it up for me again  staying at a house called walmesley lodge     where i shall expect you with all the impatience of one     soliciting an honour  and hoping that it will be conferred upon     him     i trust that any little difference of opinion on other subjects     will not interfere to prevent the harmony of our morning s meal     together     believe me to be  my dear sir  with the greatest possible     consideration  your very obedient  humble servant     francis varney the admiral gasped again  and looked at mr  chillingworth  and then at the note  and then at mr  chillingworth again  as if he was perfectly bewildered that s about the coolest piece of business  said mr  chillingworth that ever i heard of hang me  said the admiral  if i sha n t like the fellow at last  it is cool  and i like it because it is cool  where s my hat  where s my stick what are you going to do accept his invitation  to be sure  and breakfast with him  and  my learned friend  as he calls you  i hope you ll come likewise  i ll take the fellow at his word  by fair means  or by foul  i ll know what he wants here  and why he persecutes this family  for whom i have an attachment  and what hand he has in the disappearance of my nephew charles holland  for  as sure as there s a heaven above us  he s at the bottom of that affair  where is this walmesley lodge just in the neighbourhood  but come on  then  come on but  really  admiral  you don t mean to say you ll breakfast with with a vampyre  yes  i would  and will  and mean to do so  here  jack  you needn t go to mr  bannerworth s yet  come  my learned friend  let s take time by the forelock chapter lx the interrupted breakfast at sir francis varney s illustration notwithstanding all mr  chillingworth could say to the contrary  the admiral really meant to breakfast with sir francis varney the worthy doctor could not for some time believe but that the admiral must be joking  when he talked in such a strain  but he was very soon convinced to the contrary  by the latter actually walking out and once more asking him  mr  chillingworth  if he meant to go with him  or not this was conclusive  so the doctor said well  admiral  this appears to me rather a mad sort of freak  but  as i have begun the adventure with you  i will conclude it with you that s right  said the admiral  i m not deceived in you  doctor  so come along  hang these vampyres  i don t know how to tackle them myself  i think  after all  sir francis varney is more in your line than line is in mine how do you mean why  couldn t you persuade him he s ill  and wants some physic  that would soon settle him  you know settle him  said mr  chillingworth  i beg to say that if i did give him any physic  the dose would be much to his advantage  but  however my opinion is  that this invitation to breakfast is  after all  a mere piece of irony  and that  when we get to walmesley lodge  we shall not see anything of him  on the contrary  we shall probably find it s a hoax i certainly shouldn t like that  but still it s worth the trying  the fellow has really behaved himself in such an extraordinary manner  that if i can make terms with him i will  and there s one thing  you know doctor  that i think we may say we have discovered and what may that be  is it  not to make too sure of a vampyre  even when you have him by the leg no  that ain t it  though that s a very good thing in its way  but it is just this  that sir francis varney  whoever he is and whatever he is is after bannerworth hall  and not the bannerworth family  if you recollect  mr  chillingworth  in our conversation  i have always insisted upon that fact you have  and it seems to me to be completely verified by the proceedings of the night  there  then  admiral  is the great mystery what can he want at bannerworth hall that makes him take such a world of trouble  and run so many fearful risks in trying to get at it that is  indeed  the mystery  and if he really means this invitation to breakfast  i shall ask him plumply  and tell him  at the same time  that possibly his very best way to secure his object will be to be candid vampyre as he is but really  admiral  you do not still cling to that foolish superstition of believing that sir francis varney is in reality a vampyre i don t know  and i can t say  if anybody was to give me a description of a strange sort of fish that i had never seen  i wouldn t take upon myself to say there wasn t such a thing  nor would you  doctor  if you had really seen the many odd ones that i have encountered at various times well  well  admiral  i m certainly not belonging to that school of philosophy which declares the impossible to be what it don t understand there may be vampyres  and there may be apparitions  for all i know to the contrary  i only doubt these things  because i think  if they were true  that  as a phenomena of nature  they would have been by this time established by repeated instances without the possibility of doubt or cavil well  there s something in that  but how far have we got to go now no further than to yon enclosure where you see those park like looking gates  and that cedar tree stretching its dark green foliage so far into the road  that is walmesley lodge  whither you have been invited and you  my learned friend  recollect that you were invited too  so that you are no intruder upon the hospitality of varney the vampyre i say  admiral  said mr  chillingworth  when they reached the gates you know it is not quite the thing to call a man a vampyre at his own breakfast table  so just oblige me by promising not to make any such remark to sir francis a likely thing  said the admiral  he knows i know what he is  and he knows i m a plain man and a blunt speaker  however  i ll be civil to him  and more than that i can t promise  i must wring out of him  if i can  what has become of charles holland  and what the deuce he really wants himself well  well  come to no collision with him  while we re his guests not if i can help it the doctor rang at the gate bell of walmesley lodge  and was in a few moments answered by a woman  who demanded their business is sir francis varney here  said the doctor oh  ah  yes  she replied  you see his house was burnt down  for something or other i m sure i don t know what by some people i m sure i don t know who  so  as the lodge was to let  we have took him in till he can suit himself ah  that s it  is it  said the admiral tell him that admiral bell and dr  chillingworth are here very well  said the woman  you may walk in thank ye  you re vastly obliging  ma am  is there anything going on in the breakfast line well  yes  i am getting him some breakfast  but he didn t say as he expected company the woman opened the garden gate  and they walked up a trimly laid out garden to the lodge  which was a cottage like structure in external appearance  although within it boasted of all the comforts of a tolerably extensive house she left them in a small room  leading from the hall  and was absent about five minutes  then she returned  and  merely saying that sir francis varney presented his compliments  and desired them to walk up stairs  she preceded them up a handsome flight which led to the first floor of the lodge up to this moment  mr  chillingworth had expected some excuse  for notwithstanding all he had heard and seen of sir francis varney  he could not believe that any amount of impudence would suffice to enable him to receive people as his guests  with whom he must feel that he was at such positive war it was a singular circumstance  and  perhaps  the only thing that matched the cool impertinence of the invitation  was the acceptance of it under the circumstances by the admiral sir francis varney might have intended it as a jest  but if he did so in the first instance  it was evident he would not allow himself to be beaten with his own weapons the room into which they were shown was a longish narrow one  a very wide door gave them admission to it  at the end  nearest the staircase and at its other extremity there was a similar door opening into some other apartments of the house sir francis varney sat with his back towards this second door  and a table  with some chairs and other articles of furniture  were so arranged before him  that while they seemed but to be carelessly placed in the position they occupied  they really formed a pretty good barrier between him and his visitors the admiral  however  was too intent upon getting a sight of varney  to notice any preparation of this sort  and he advanced quickly into the room and there  indeed  was the much dreaded  troublesome  persevering  and singular looking being who had caused such a world of annoyance to the family of the bannerworths  as well as disturbing the peace of the whole district  which had the misfortune to have him as an inhabitant if anything  he looked thinner  taller  and paler than usual  and there seemed to be a slight nervousness of manner about him  as he slowly inclined his head towards the admiral  which was not quite intelligible well  said admiral bell  you invited me to breakfast  and my learned friend  here we are no two human beings  said varney  could be more welcome to my hospitality than yourself and dr  chillingworth  i pray you to be seated  what a pleasant thing it is  after the toils and struggles of this life  occasionally to sit down in the sweet companionship of such dear friends he made a hideous face as he spoke  and the admiral looked as if he were half inclined to quarrel at that early stage of the proceedings dear friends  he said  well  well it s no use squabbling about a word or two  but i tell you what it is  mr  varney  or sir francis varney  or whatever your d d name is hold  my dear sir  said varney after breakfast  if you please after breakfast he rang a hand bell as he spoke  and the woman who had charge of the house brought in a tray tolerably covered with the materials for a substantial morning s meal  she placed it upon the table  and certainly the various articles that smoked upon it did great credit to her culinary powers deborah  said sir varney  in a mild sort of tone  keep on continually bringing things to eat until this old brutal sea ruffian has satiated his disgusting appetite the admiral opened his eyes an enormous width  and  looking at sir francis varney  he placed his two fists upon the table  and drew a long breath did you address those observations to me  he said  at length  you blood sucking vagabond eh  said sir francis varney  looking over the admiral s head  as if he saw something interesting on the wall beyond my dear admiral  said mr  chillingworth  come away i ll see you d d first  said the admiral  now  mr  vampyre  no shuffling  did you address those observations to me deborah  said sir francis varney  in silvery tones  you can remove this tray and bring on the next not if i know it  said the admiral i came to breakfast  and i ll have it  after breakfast i ll pull your nose ay  if you were fifty vampyres i d do it dr  chillingworth  said varney  without paying the least attention to what the admiral said  you don t eat  my dear sir  you must be fatigued with your night s exertions  a man of your age  you know  cannot be supposed to roll and tumble about like a fool in a pantomime with impunity  only think what a calamity it would be if you were laid up your patients would all get well  you know sir francis varney  said mr  chillingworth  we re your guests  we come here at your invitation to partake of a meal  you have wantonly attacked both of us  i need not say that by so doing you cast a far greater slur upon your own taste and judgment than you can upon us admirably spoken  said sir francis varney  giving his hands a clap together that made the admiral jump again  now  old bell  i ll fight you  if you think yourself aggrieved  while the doctor sees fair play old who  shouted the admiral bell  bell is not your name bell a family cognomen  i presume  on account of the infernal clack  clack  without any sense in it  that is the characteristic of your race you ll fight me  said the admiral  jumping up yes  if you challenge me by jove i do  of course then i accept it  and the challenged party  you know well  or ought to know  can make his own terms in the encounter make what terms you please  i care not what they are  only say you will fight  and that s sufficient it is well  said sir francis varney  in a solemn tone nay  nay  interrupted mr  chillingworth  this is boyish folly hold your row  said the admiral  and let s hear what he s got to say in this mansion  said sir francis varney for a mansion it is although under the unpretending name of a lodge in this mansion there is a large apartment which was originally fitted up by a scientific proprietor of the place  for the purpose of microscopic and other experiments  which required a darkness total and complete  such a darkness as seems as if it could be felt palpable  thick  and obscure as the darkness of the tomb  and i know what that is the devil you do  said this admiral it s damp  too  ain t it the room no  the grave oh  uncommonly  after autumnal rains  but to resume this room is large  lofty  and perfectly empty well i propose that we procure two scythes two what scythes  with their long handles  and their convenient holding places well  i ll be hanged  what next do you propose you may be hanged  the next is  that with these scythes we be both of us placed in the darkened room  and the door closed  and doubly locked upon us for one hour  and that then and there we do our best each to cut the other in two  if you succeed in dismembering me  you will have won the day  but i hope  from my superior agility here sir francis jumped upon his chair  and sat upon the back of it to get the better of you how do you like the plan i have proposed  does it meet your wishes curse your impudence  said the admiral  placing his elbows upon the table and resting his chin in astonishment upon his two hands nay  interrupted sir francis  you challenged me  and  besides  you ll have an equal chance  you know that  if you succeed in striking me first  down i go  whereas it i succeed in striking you first  down you go as he spoke  sir francis varney stretched out his foot  and closed a small bracket which held out the flap of the table on which the admiral was leaning  and  accordingly  down the admiral went  tea tray and all mr  chillingworth ran to help him up  and  when they both recovered their feet  they found they were alone chapter lxi the mysterious stranger the particulars of the suicide at bannerworth hall illustration hilloa where the deuce is he  said the admiral  was there ever such a confounded take in well  i really don t know  said mr  chillingworth  but it seems to me that he must have gone out of that door that was behind him  i begin  do you know  admiral  to wish what that we had never come here at all  and i think the sooner we get out of it the better yes  but i am not going to be hoaxed and humbugged in this way  i will have satisfaction  but not with those confounded scythes and things he talks about in the dark room  give me broad daylight and no favour yardarm and yardarm  broadside and broadside  hand grenades and marling spikes well  but that s what he won t do  now  admiral  listen to me well  go on  what next come away at once oh  you said that before yes  but i m going to say something else  look round you  don t you think this a large  scientific looking room what of that why  what if suppose it was to become as dark as the grave  and varney was to enter with his scythe  that he talks of  and begin mowing about our legs the devil  come along the door at which they entered was at this moment opened  and the old woman made her appearance please  sir  she said  here s a mr  mortimer  in a loud voice  oh sir francis ain t here  where s he gone  gentlemen to the devil  said the admiral  who may mr  mortimer be there walked past the woman a stout  portly looking man  well dressed but with a very odd look upon his face  in consequence of an obliquity of vision  which prevented the possibility of knowing which way he was looking i must see him  he said  i must see him mr  chillingworth started back as if in amazement good god  he cried  you here confusion  said mortimer  are you dr  dr the same  hush  there is no occasion to betray that is  to state my secret and mine  too  said chillingworth  but what brings you here i cannot and dare not tell you  farewell he turned abruptly  and was leaving the room  but he ran against some one at the entrance  and in another moment henry bannerworth  heated and almost breathless by evident haste  made his appearance hilloa  bravo  cried the admiral  the more the merrier  here s a combined squadron  why  how came you here  mr  henry bannerworth bannerworth  said mortimer  is that young man s name bannerworth yes  said henry  do you know me  sir no  no  only i i must be off  does anybody know anything of sir francis varney we did know something of him  said the admiral  a little while ago but he s taken himself off  don t you do so likewise  if you ve got anything to say  stop and say it  like an englishman stuff  stuff  said mortimer  impatiently  what do you all want here why  sir francis varney  said henry and i care not if the whole world heard it is the persecutor of my family how  in what way he has the reputation of a vampyre  he has hunted me and mine from house and home indeed yes  cried dr  chillingworth  and  by some means or another  he seems determined to get possession of bannerworth hall well  gentlemen  said mortimer  i promise you that i will inquire into this  mr  chillingworth  i did not expect to meet you  perhaps the least we say to each other is  after all  the better let me ask but one question  said dr  chillingworth  imploringly ask it did he live after hush  he did you always told me to the contrary yes  i had an object  the game is up  farewell  and  gentlemen  as i am making my exit  let me do so with a sentiment society at large is divided into two great classes and what may they be  said the admiral those who have been hanged  and those who have not  adieu he turned and left the room  and mr  chillingworth sunk into a chair and said  in a low voice it s uncommonly true  and i ve found out an acquaintance among the former d n it  you seem all mad  said the admiral  i can t make out what you are about  how came you here  mr  henry bannerworth by mere accident i heard  said henry  that you were keeping watch and ward in the hall  admiral  it was cruel  and not well done of you  to attempt such an enterprise without acquainting me with it  did you suppose for a moment that i  who had the greatest interest in this affair  would have shrunk from danger  if danger there be  or lacked perseverance  if that quality were necessary in carrying out any plan by which the safety and honour of my family might be preserved nay  now  my young friend  said mr  chillingworth nay  sir  but i take it ill that i should have been kept out of this affair  and it should have been sedulously  as it were  kept a secret from me let him go on as he likes  said the admiral  boys will be boys  after all  you know  doctor  it s my affair  and not yours  let him say what he likes  where s the odds  it s of no consequence i do not expect  admiral bell  said henry  that it is to you  but it is to me psha respecting you  sir  as i do gammon i must confess that i did expect what you didn t get  therefore  there s an end of that  now  i tell you what  henry  sir francis varney is within this house  at least  i have reason to suppose so then  exclaimed henry  impetuously  i will wring from him answers to various questions which concern my peace and happiness please  gentlemen  said the woman deborah  making her appearance  sir francis varney has gone out  and he says i m to show you all the door as soon as it is convenient for you all to walk out of it i feel convinced  said mr  chillingworth  that it will be a useless search now to attempt to find sir francis varney here  let me beg of you all to come away  and believe me that i do not speak lightly  or with a view to get you from here  when i say  that after i have heard something from you  henry  which i shall ask you to relate to me  painful though it may be  i shall be able to suggest some explanation of many things which appear at present obscure  and to put you in a course of freeing you from the difficulties which surround you  which  heaven knows  i little expected i should have it in my power to propose to any of you i will follow your advice  mr  chillingworth  said henry  for i have always found that it has been dictated by good feeling as well as correct judgment  admiral bell  you will oblige me much by coming away with me now and at once well  remarked the admiral  if the doctor has really something to say  it alters the appearance of things  and  of course  i have no objection upon this  the whole three of them immediately left the place  and it was evident that mr  chillingworth had something of an uncomfortable character upon his mind  he was unusually silent and reserved  and  when he did speak  he seemed rather inclined to turn the conversation upon indifferent topics  than to add anything more to what he had said upon the deeply interesting one which held so foremost a place in all their minds how is flora  now  he asked of henry  since her removal anxious still  said henry  but  i think  better that is well  i perceive that  naturally  we are all three walking towards bannerworth hall  and  perhaps  it is as well that on that spot i should ask of you  henry  to indulge me with a confidence such as under ordinary circumstances  i should not at all feel myself justified in requiring of you to what does it relate  said henry  you may be assured  mr chillingworth  that i am not likely to refuse my confidence to you  whom i have so much reason to respect as an attached friend of myself and my family you will not object  likewise  i hope  added mr  chillingworth  to extend that confidence to admiral bell  for  as you well know  a truer and more warm hearted man than he does not exist what do you expect for that  doctor  said the admiral there is nothing  said henry  that i could relate at all  that i should shrink from relating to admiral bell well  my boy  said the admiral  and all i can reply to that is  you are quite right  for there can be nothing that you need shrink from telling me  so far as regards the fact of trusting me with it goes i am assured of that a british officer  once pledging his word  prefers death to breaking it  whatever you wish kept secret in the communication you make to me say so  and it will never pass my lips why  sir  the fact is  said henry  that what i am about to relate to you consists not so much of secrets as of matters which would be painful to my feelings to talk of more than may be absolutely required i understand you let me  for a moment  said mr chillingworth  put myself right  i do not suspect  mr  henry bannerworth  that you fancy i ask you to make a recital of circumstances which must be painful to you from any idle motive  but let me declare that i have now a stronger impulse  which induces me to wish to hear from your own lips those matters which popular rumour may have greatly exaggerated or vitiated it is scarcely possible  remarked henry  sadly  that popular rumour should exaggerate the facts indeed no  they are  unhappily  of themselves  in their bare truthfulness  so full of all that can be grievous to those who are in any way connected with them  that there needs no exaggeration to invest them with more terror  or with more of that sadness which must ever belong to a recollection of them in my mind in suchlike discourse as this  the time was passed  until henry bannerworth and his friends once more reached the hall  from which he with his family  had so recently removed  in consequence of the fearful persecution to which they had been subjected they passed again into the garden which they all knew so well  and then henry paused and looked around him with a deep sigh in answer to an inquiring glance from mr  chillingworth  he said is it not strange  now  that i should have only been away from here a space of time which may be counted by hours  and yet all seems changed i could almost fancy that years had elapsed since i had looked at it oh  remarked the doctor  time is always by the imagination measured by the number of events which are crowded into a given space of it  and not by its actual duration  come into the house  there you will find all just as you left it  henry  and you can tell us your story at leisure the air  said henry  about here is fresh and pleasant  let us sit down in the summer house yonder  and there i will tell you all  it has a local interest  too  connected with the tale this was agreed to  and  in a few moments  the admiral  mr chillingworth  and henry were seated in the same summer house which had witnessed the strange interview between sir francis varney and flora bannerworth  in which he had induced her to believe that he felt for the distress he had occasioned her  and was strongly impressed with the injustice of her sufferings henry was silent for some few moments  and then he said  with a deep sigh  as he looked mournfully around him illustration it was on this spot that my father breathed his last  and hence have i said that it has a local interest in the tale i have to tell  which makes it the most fitting place in which to tell it oh  said the admiral  he died here  did he yes  where you are now sitting very good  i have seen many a brave man die in my time  and i hope to see a few more  although  i grant you  the death in the heat of conflict  and fighting for our country  is a vastly different thing to some shore going mode of leaving the world yes  said henry  as if pursuing his own meditations  rather than listening to the admiral  yes  it was from this precise spot that my father took his last look at the ancient house of his race  what we can now see of it  he saw of it with his dying eyes and many a time i have sat here and fancied the world of terrible thoughts that must at such a moment have come across his brain you might well do so  said the doctor you see  added henry  that from here the fullest view you have of any of the windows of the house is of that of flora s room  as we have always called it  because for years she had had it as her chamber  and when all the vegetation of summer is in its prime  and the vine which you perceive crawls over this summer house is full of leaf and fruit the view is so much hindered that it is difficult  without making an artificial gap in the clustering foliage  to see anything but the window so i should imagine  replied mr  chillingworth you  doctor  added henry  who know much of my family  need not be told what sort of man my father was no  indeed but you  admiral bell  who do not know  must be told  and  however grievous it may be to me to have to say so  i must inform you that he was not a man who would have merited your esteem well  said the admiral  you know  my boy  that can make no difference as regards you in anybody s mind  who has got the brains of an owl every man s credit  character  and honour  to my thinking  is in his own most special keeping  and let your father be what he might  or who he might  i do not see that any conduct of his ought to raise upon your cheek the flush of shame  or cost you more uneasiness than ordinary good feeling dictates to the errors and feelings of a fellow creature if all the world  said henry  would take such liberal and comprehensive views as you do  admiral  it would be much happier than it is  but such is not the case  and people are but too apt to blame one person for the evil that another has done ah  but  said mr  chillingworth  it so happens that those are the people whose opinions are of the very least consequence there is some truth in that  said henry  sadly  but  however  let me proceed  since i have to tell the tale  i could wish it over  my father then  admiral bell  although a man not tainted in early life with vices became  by the force of bad associates  and a sort of want of congeniality and sentiment that sprang up between him and my mother plunged into all the excesses of his age these excesses were all of that character which the most readily lay hold strongly of an unreflecting mind  because they all presented themselves in the garb of sociality the wine cup is drained in the name of good fellowship  money which is wanted for legitimate purposes is squandered under the mask of a noble and free generosity  and all that the small imaginations of a number of persons of perverted intellects could enable them to do  has been done from time to time  to impart a kind of lustre to intemperance and all its dreadful and criminal consequences my father  having once got into the company of what he considered wits and men of spirit  soon became thoroughly vitiated  he was almost the only one of the set among whom he passed what he considered his highly convivial existence  who was really worth anything  pecuniarily speaking  there were some among them who might have been respectable men  and perchance carved their way to fortune  as well as some others who had started in life with good patrimonies  but he  my father  at the time he became associated with them  was the only one  as i say  who  to use a phrase i have heard myself from his lips concerning them  had got a feather to fly with the consequence of this was  that his society  merely for the sake of the animal gratification of drinking at his expense was courted  and he was much flattered  all of which he laid to the score of his own merits which had been found out  and duly appreciated by these bon vivants while he considered that the grave admonitions of his real friends proceeded from nothing in the world but downright envy and malice such a state of things as this could not last very long  the associates of my father wanted money as well as wine  so they introduced him to the gaming table  and he became fascinated with the fearful vice to an extent which predicted his own destruction and the ruin of every one who was in any way dependent upon him he could not absolutely sell bannerworth hall  unless i had given my consent  which i refused  but he accumulated debt upon debt  and from time to time stripped the mansion of all its most costly contents with various mutations of fortune  he continued this horrible and baneful career for a long time  until  at last  he found himself utterly and irretrievably ruined  and he came home in an agony of despair  being so weak  and utterly ruined in constitution  that he kept his bed for many days it appeared  however  that something occurred at this juncture which gave him actually  or all events awakened a hope that he should possess some money  and be again in a position to try his fortune at the gaming table he rose  and  fortifying himself once more with the strong stimulant of wine and spirits  he left his home  and was absent for about two months what occurred to him during that time we none of us ever knew  but late one night he came home  apparently much flurried in manner  and seeming as if something had happened to drive him half mad he would not speak to any one  but he shut himself up the whole of the night in the chamber where hangs the portrait that bears so strong a resemblance to sir francis varney  and there he remained till the morning  when he emerged  and said briefly that he intended to leave the country he was in a most fearful state of nervousness  and my mother tells me that he shook like one in an ague  and started at every little sound that occurred in the house  and glared about him so wildly that it was horrible to see him  or to sit in the same apartment with him she says that the whole morning passed on in this way till a letter came to him  the contents of which appeared to throw him into a perfect convulsion of terror  and he retired again to the room with the portrait  where he remained some hours  and then he emerged  looking like a ghost  so dreadfully pale and haggard was he he walked into the garden here  and was seen to sit down in this summer house  and fix his eyes upon the window of that apartment henry paused for a few moments  and then he added you will excuse me from entering upon any details of what next ensued in the melancholy history  my father here committed suicide  he was found dying  and all i he words he spoke were  the money is hidden death claimed his victim  and  with a convulsive spasm  he resigned his spirit  leaving what he had intended to say hidden in the oblivion of the grave that was an odd affair  said the admiral it was  indeed  we have all pondered deeply  and the result was  that upon the whole  we were inclined to come to an opinion that the words he so uttered were but the result of the mental disturbance that at such a moment might well be supposed to be ensuing in the mind  and that they related really to no foregone fact any more than some incoherent words uttered by a man in a dream might be supposed to do it may be so i do not mean  remarked mr  chillingworth  for one moment to attempt to dispute  henry  the rationality of such an opinion as you have just given utterance to  but you forget that another circumstance occurred which gave a colour to the words used by your father yes  i know to what you allude be so good as to state it to the admiral i will  on the evening of that same day there came a man here  who  in seeming ignorance of what had occurred  although by that time it was well known to all the neighbourhood  asked to see my father upon being told that he was dead  he started back  either with well acted or with real surprise  and seemed to be immensely chagrined  he then demanded to know if he had left any disposition of his property but he got no information  and departed muttering the most diabolical oaths and curses that can be imagined  he mounted his horse  for he had ridden to the hall and his last words were  as i am told where  in the name of all that s damnable  can he have put the money and did you never find out who this man was  asked the admiral never it is an odd affair it is  said mr  chillingworth  and full of mystery  the public mind was much taken up at the time with some other matters  or it would have made the death of mr  bannerworth the subject of more prolific comment than it did  as it was  however  a great deal was said upon the subject and the whole comity was in a state of commotion for weeks afterwards yes  said henry  it so happened that about that very time a murder was committed in the neighbourhood of london  which baffled all the exertions of the authorities to discover the perpetrators of  it was the murder of lord lorne oh  i remember  said the admiral  the newspapers were full of it for a long time they were  and so  as mr  chillingworth says  the more exciting interest which that affair created drew off public attention  in a great measure  from my father s suicide  and we did not suffer so much from public remark and from impertinent curiosity as might have been expected and  in addition  said mr  chillingworth  and he changed colour a little as he spoke  there was an execution shortly afterwards yes  said henry  there was the execution of a man named angerstein  added mr  chillingworth  for a highway robbery  attended with the most brutal violence true  all the affairs of that period of time are strongly impressed upon my mind  said henry  but you do not seem well  mr chillingworth oh  yes  i am quite well you are mistaken both the admiral and henry looked scrutinizingly at the doctor  who certainly appeared to them to be labouring under some great mental excitement  which he found it almost beyond his power to repress i tell you what it is  doctor  said the admiral  i don t pretend  and never did  to see further through a tar barrel than my neighbours  but i can see far enough to feel convinced that you have got something on your mind  and that it somehow concerns this affair is it so  said henry i cannot if i would  said mr  chillingworth  and i may with truth add  that i would not  if i could  hide from you that i have something on my mind connected with this affair  but let me assure you it would be premature of me to tell you of it premature be d d  said the admiral  out with it nay  nay  dear sir  i am not now in a position to say what is passing through my mind alter your position  then  and be blowed  cried jack pringle  suddenly stepping forward  and giving the doctor such a push  that he nearly went through one of the sides of the summer house why  you scoundrel  cried the admiral  how came you here on my legs  said jack  do you think nobody wants to know nothing but yourself  i m as fond of a yarn as anybody but if you are  said mr  chillingworth  you had no occasion to come against me as if you wanted to move a house you said as you wasn t in a position to say something as i wanted to hear  so i thought i d alter it for you is this fellow  said the doctor  shaking his head  as he accosted the admiral  the most artful or stupid a little of both  said admiral bell a little of both  doctor  he s a great fool and a great scamp the same to you  said jack  you re another  i shall hate you presently  if you go on making yourself so ridiculous  now  mind  i ll only give you a trial of another week or so  and if you don t be more purlite in your d n language  i ll leave you away strolled jack  with his hands in his pockets  towards the house while the admiral was half choked with rage  and could only glare after him  without the ability to say a word under any other circumstances than the present one of trouble  and difficulty  and deep anxiety  henry bannerworth must have laughed at these singular little episodes between jack and the admiral  but his mind was now by far too much harassed to permit him to do so let him go  let him go  my dear sir  said mr  chillingworth to the admiral  who showed some signs of an intention to pursue jack  he no doubt has been drinking again i ll turn him off the first moment i catch him sober enough to understand me  said the admiral well  well  do as you please  but now let me ask a favour of both of you what is it that you will leave bannerworth hall to me for a week what for i hope to make some discoveries connected with it which shall well reward you for the trouble it s no trouble  said henry  and for myself  i have amply sufficient faith  both in your judgment and in your friendship  doctor  to accede to any request which you may make to me and i  said the admiral  be it so be it so  for one week  you say yes for one week  i hope  by the end of that time  to have achieved something worth the telling you of  and i promise you that  if i am at all disappointed in my expectation  that i will frankly and freely communicate to you all i know and all i suspect then that s a bargain it is and what s to be done at once why  nothing  but to take the greatest possible care that bannerworth hall is not left another hour without some one in it  and in order that such should be the case  i have to request that you two will remain here until i go to the town  and make preparations for taking quiet possession of it myself  which i will do in the course of two hours  at most don t be longer  said the admiral  for i am so desperately hungry that i shall certainly begin to eat somebody  if you are depend upon me very well  said henry  you may depend we will wait here until you come back the doctor at once hurried from the garden  leaving henry and the admiral to amuse themselves as best they might  with conjectures as to what he was really about  until his return chapter lxii the mysterious meeting in the ruin again the vampyre s attack upon the constable illustration it is now necessary that we return once more to that mysterious ruin  in the intricacies of which varney  when pursued by the mob  had succeeded in finding a refuge which defied all the exertions which were made for his discovery  our readers must be well aware  that  connected with that ruin  are some secrets of great importance to our story  and we will now  at the solemn hour of midnight  take another glance at what is doing within its recesses at that solemn hour it is not probable that any one would seek that gloomy place from choice  some lover of the picturesque certainly might visit it  but such was not the inciting cause of the pilgrimage with those who were soon to stand within its gloomy precincts other motives dictated their presence in that spot motives of rapine peradventure of murder itself as the neighbouring clocks sounded the hour of twelve  and the faint strokes were borne gently on the wind to that isolated ruin  there might have been seen a tall man standing by the porch of what had once been a large doorway to some portion of the ruin his form was enveloped in a large cloak  which was of such ample material that he seemed well able to wrap it several times around him and then leave a considerable portion of it floating idly in the gentle wind he stood as still  as calm  and as motionless as a statue  for a considerable time  before any degree of impatience began to show itself then he took from his pocket a large antique watch  the white face of which just enabled him to see what the time was  and  in a voice which had in it some amount of petulance and anger  he said not come yet  and nearly half an hour beyond the time  what can have detained him  this is  indeed  trifling with the most important moments of a man s existence even as he spoke  he heard  from some distance off  the sound of a short  quick footstep  he bent forwards to listen  and then  in a tone of satisfaction  he said he comes he comes but he who thus waited for some confederate among these dim and old grey ruins  advanced not a step to meet him  on the contrary  such seemed the amount of cold blooded caution which he possessed  that the nearer the man who was evidently advancing got to the place  the further back did he who had preceded him shrink into the shadow of the dim and crumbling walls  which had  for some years now past  seemed to bend to the passing blast  and to be on the point of yielding to the destroying hand of time and yet  surely he needed not have been so cautious  who was likely  at such an hour as that  to come to the ruins  but one who sought it by appointment and  moreover  the manner of the advancing man should have been quite sufficient to convince him who waited  that so much caution was unnecessary  but it was a part and parcel of his nature about three minutes more sufficed to bring the second man to the ruin and he  at once  and fearlessly  plunged into its recesses who comes  said the first man  in a deep  hollow voice he whom you expect  was the reply good  he said  and at once he now emerged from his hiding place  and they stood together in the nearly total darkness with which the place was enshrouded  for the night was a cloudy one  and there appeared not a star in the heavens  to shed its faint light upon the scene below for a few moments they were both silent  for he who had last arrived had evidently made great exertions to reach the spot  and was breathing laboriously  while he who was there first appeared  from some natural taciturnity of character  to decline opening the conversation at length the second comer spoke  saying i have made some exertion to get here to my time  and yet i am beyond it  as you are no doubt aware yes  yes well  such would not have been the case  but yet  i stayed to bring you some news of importance indeed it is so  this place  which we have  now for some time had as a quiet and perfectly eligible one of meeting  is about to be invaded by one of those restless  troublesome spirits  who are never happy but when they are contriving something to the annoyance of others who do not interfere with them explain yourself more fully i will  at a tavern in the town  there has happened some strange scenes of violence  in consequence of the general excitement into which the common people have been thrown upon the dreadful subject of vampyres well the consequence is  that numerous arrests have taken place  and the places of confinement for offenders against the laws are now full of those whose heated and angry imaginations have induced them to take violent steps to discover the reality or the falsehood of rumours which so much affected them  their wives  and their families  that they feared to lie down to their night s repose the other laughed a short  hollow  restless sort of laugh  which had not one particle of real mirth in it go on go on  he said  what did they do immense excesses have been committed  but what made me  first of all stay beyond my time  was that i overheard a man declare his intentions this night  from twelve till the morning  and for some nights to come to hold watch and ward for the vampyre indeed yes  he did but stay  at the earnest solicitation of his comrades  to take yet another glass  ere he came upon his expedition he must be met  the idiot  what business is it of his there are always people who will make everything their business whether it be so or not there are  let us retire further into the recesses of the ruin  and there consider as well what is to be done regarding more important affairs  as with this rash intruder here they both walked for some twenty paces  or so  right into the ruin  and then he who had been there first  said  suddenly  to his companion i am annoyed  although the feeling reaches no further than annoyance for i have a natural love of mischief  to think that my reputation has spread so widely  and made so much noise your reputation as a vampyre  sir francis varney  you mean yes  but there is no occasion for you to utter my name aloud  even here where we are alone together it came out unawares unawares  can it be possible that you have so little command over yourself as to allow a name to come from your lips unawares sometimes i am surprised well  it cannot be helped  what do you now propose to do nay  you are my privy councillor  have you no deep laid  artful project in hand  can you not plan and arrange something which may yet have the effect of accomplishing what at first seemed so very simple  but which has  from one unfortunate circumstance and another  become full of difficulty and pregnant with all sorts of dangers i must confess i have no plan i listen with astonishment nay  now  you are jesting when did you ever hear of me jesting not often  i admit  but you have a fertile genius  and i have always myself  found it easier to be the executive than to plan an elaborate course of action for others then you throw it all on me i throw a weight  naturally enough  upon the shoulders which i think the best adapted to sustain it be it so  then be it so you are  i presume  from what you say  provided with a scheme of action which shall present better hopes of success  at less risk  i hope  look what great danger we have already passed through yes  we have i pray you avoid that in the next campaign it is not the danger that annoys and troubles me  but it is that notwithstanding it  the object is as far off as ever from being attained and not only so  but  as is invariably the case under such circumstances  we have made it more difficult of execution because we have put those upon their guard thoroughly who are the most likely to oppose us we have we have and placed the probability of success afar off indeed and yet i have set my life upon the cast  and i will stand the hazard i tell you i will accomplish this object  or i will perish in the attempt you are too enthusiastic not at all  nothing has been ever done  the execution of which was difficult  without enthusiasm  i will do what i intend  or bannerworth hall shall become a heap of ruins  where fire shall do its worst work of devastation  and i will myself find a grave in the midst well  i quarrel with no man for chalking out the course he intends to pursue  but what do you mean to do with the prisoner below here kill him what i say kill him  do you not understand me i do  indeed when everything else is secured  and when the whole of that which i so much court  and which i will have  is in my possession  i will take his life  or you shall  ay  you are just the man for such a deed  a smooth faced  specious sort of roan are you  and you like not danger there will be none in taking the life of a man who is chained to the floor of a dungeon i know not why  said the other  you take a pleasure on this particular night  of all others  in saying all you can which you think will be offensive to me now  how you wrong me  this is the reward of confidence i don t want such confidence why  you surely don t want me to flatter you no  but psha  hark you  that admiral is the great stumbling block in my way  i should ere this have had undisturbed possession of bannerworth hall but for him  he must be got out of the way somehow a short time will tire him out of watching  he is one of those men of impulse who soon become wearied of inaction ay  and then the bannerworths return to the hall it may be so i am certain of it  we have been out generalled in this matter although i grant we did all that men could do to give us success in what way would you get rid of this troublesome admiral i scarcely know  a letter from his nephew might  if well put together get him to london i doubt it  i hate him mortally  he has offended me more than once most grievously i know it  he saw through you i do not give him so much credit  he is a suspicious man  and a vain and a jealous one and yet he saw through you  now  listen to me  you are completely at fault  and have no plan of operations whatever in your mind  what i want you to do is  to disappear from the neighbourhood for a time  and so will i  as for our prisoner here below  i cannot see what else can be done with him than than than what  do you hesitate i do then what is it you were about to say i cannot but feel that all we have done hitherto  as regards this young prisoner of ours  has failed  he has  with a determined obstinacy  set at naught  as well you know  all threats he has he has refused to do one act which could in any way aid me in my objects  in fact  from the first to the last  he has been nothing but an expense and an encumbrance to us both all that is strictly true and yet  although you  as well as i  know of a marvellously ready way of getting rid of such encumbrances  i must own  that i shrink with more than a feeling of reluctance from the murder of the youth you contemplated it then  asked the other no  i cannot be said to have contemplated it  that is not the proper sort of expression to use what is then to contemplate a deed seems to me to have some close connexion to the wish to do it and you have no such wish i have no such wish  and what is more i will not do it then that is sufficient  and the only question that remains for you to confide  is  what you will do  it is far easier in all enterprises to decide upon what we will not do  than upon what we will  for my own part i must say that i can perceive no mode of extricating ourselves from this involvement with anything like safety then it must be done with something like danger as you please you say so  and your words bear a clear enough signification  but from your tone i can guess how much you are dissatisfied with the aspect of affairs dissatisfied yes  i say  dissatisfied  be frank  and own that which it is in vain to conceal from me  i know you too well  arch hypocrite as you are  and fully capable of easily deceiving many  you cannot deceive me i really cannot understand you then i will take care that you shall how listen  i will not have the life of charles holland taken who wishes to take it you there  indeed  you wrong me  unless you yourself thought that such an act was imperatively called for by the state of affairs  do you think that i would needlessly bring down upon my head the odium as well as the danger of such a deed  no  no  let him live  if you are willing  he may live a thousand years for all i care tis well  i am  mark me  not only willing  but i am determined that he shall live so far as we are concerned  i can respect the courage that even when he considered that his life was at stake  enabled him to say no to a proposal which was cowardly and dishonourable  although it went far to the defeat of my own plans and has involved me in much trouble hush  hush what is it i fancy i hear a footstep indeed  that were a novelty in such a place as this and yet not more than i expected  have you forgotten what i told you when i reached here to night after the appointed hour truly  i had for the moment  do you think then that the footstep which now meets our ears  is that of the adventurer who boasted that he could keep watch for the vampyre in faith do i  what is to be done with such a meddling fool he ought certainly to be taught not to be so fond of interfering with other people s affairs certainly perchance the lesson will not be wholly thrown away upon others  it may be worth while to take some trouble with this poor valiant fellow  and let him spread his news so as to stop any one else from being equally venturous and troublesome a good thought shall it be done yes  if you will arrange that which shall accomplish such a result be it so  the moon rises soon it does ah  already i fancy i see a brightening of the air as if the mellow radiance of the queen of night were already quietly diffusing itself throughout the realms of space  come further within the ruins they both walked further among the crumbling walls and fragments of columns with which the place abounded  as they did so they paused now and then to listen  and more than once they both heard plainly the sound of certain footsteps immediately outside the once handsome and spacious building varney  the vampyre  who had been holding this conversation with no other than marchdale  smiled as he  in a whispered voice  told the latter what to do in order to frighten away from the place the foolhardy man who thought that  by himself  he should be able to accomplish anything against the vampyre it was  indeed  a hair brained expedition  for whether sir francis varney was really so awful and preternatural a being as so many concurrent circumstances would seem to proclaim  or not  he was not a likely being to allow himself to be conquered by anyone individual  let his powers or his courage be what they might what induced this man to become so ventursome we shall now proceed to relate  as well as what kind of reception he got in the old ruins which  since the mysterious disappearance of sir francis varney within their recesses  had possessed so increased a share of interest and attracted so much popular attention and speculation chapter lxiii the guests at the inn  and the story of the dead uncle illustration as had been truly stated by mr  marchdale  who now stands out in his true colours to the reader as the confidant and abettor of sir francis varney  there had assembled on that evening a curious and a gossipping party at the inn where such dreadful and such riotous proceedings had taken place  which  in their proper place  we have already duly and at length recorded it was not very likely that  on that evening  or for many and many an evening to come  the conversation in the parlour of the inn would be upon any other subject than that of the vampyre indeed  the strange  mysterious  and horrible circumstances which had occurred  bade fair to be gossipping stock in trade for many a year never before had a subject presenting so many curious features arisen never  within the memory of that personage who is supposed to know everything  had there occurred any circumstance in the county  or set of circumstances  which afforded such abundant scope for conjecture and speculation everybody might have his individual opinion  and be just as likely to be right as his neighbours  and the beauty of the affair was  that such was the interest of the subject itself  that there was sure to be a kind of reflected interest with every surmise that at all bore upon it illustration on this particular night  when marchdale was prowling about  gathering what news he could  in order that he might carry it to the vampyre  a more than usually strong muster of the gossips of the town took place indeed  all of any note in the talking way were there  with the exception of one  and he was in the county gaol  being one of the prisoners apprehended by the military when they made the successful attack upon the lumber room of the inn  after the dreadful desecration of the dead which had taken place the landlord of the inn was likely to make a good thing of it  for talking makes people thirsty  and he began to consider that a vampyre about once a year would be no bad thing for the blue lion it s shocking  said one of the guests  it s shocking to think of only last night  i am quite sure i had such a fright that it added at least ten years to my age a fright  said several i believe i speak english i said a fright well  but had it anything to do with the vampyre everything oh  do tell us  do tell us all about it  how was it  did he come to you  go on  well  well the first speaker became immediately a very important personage in the room  and  when he saw that  he became at once a very important personage in his own eyes likewise  and  before he would speak another word  he filled a fresh pipe  and ordered another mug of ale it s no use trying to hurry him  said one no  he said  it isn t  i ll tell you in good time what a dreadful circumstance has made me sixty three to day  when i was only fifty three yesterday was it very dreadful rather  you wouldn t have survived it at all indeed no  now listen  i went to bed at a quarter after eleven  as usual  i didn t notice anything particular in the room did you peep under the bed no  i didn t  well  as i was a saying  to bed i went  and i didn t fasten the door  because  being a very sound sleeper  in case there was a fire  i shouldn t hear a word of it if i did no  said another  i recollect once be so good as allow me to finish what i know  before you begin to recollect anything  if you please  as i was saying  i didn t lock the door  but i went to bed  somehow or another  i did not feel at all comfortable  and i tossed about  first on one side  and then on the other  but it was all in vain  i only got  every moment  more and more fidgetty and did you think of the vampyre  said one of the listeners i thought of nothing else till i heard my clock  which is on the landing of the stairs above my bed room  begin to strike twelve ah  i like to hear a clock sound in the night  said one  it puts one in mind of the rest of the world  and lets one know one isn t all alone very good  the striking of the clock i should not at all have objected to  but it was what followed that did the business what  what fair and softly  fair and softly  just hand me a light  mr  sprigs  if you please  i ll tell you all  gentlemen  in a moment or two with the most provoking deliberation  the speaker re lit his pipe  which had gone out while he was talking  and then  after a few whiffs  to assure himself that its contents had thoroughly ignited  he resumed no sooner had the last sound of it died away  than i heard something on the stairs yes  yes it was as if some man had given his foot a hard blow against one of the stairs  and he would have needed to have had a heavy boot on to do it  i started up in bed and listened  as you may well suppose  not in the most tranquil state of mind  and then i heard an odd  gnawing sort of noise and then another dab upon one of the stairs how dreadful it was  what to do i knew not  or what to think  except that the vampyre had  by some means  got in at the attic window  and was coming down stairs to my room  that seemed the most likely  then there was another groan  and then another heavy step  and  as they were evidently coming towards my door  i felt accordingly  and got out of bed  not knowing hardly whether i was on my head or my heels  to try and lock my door ah  to be sure yes  that was all very well  if i could have done it  but a man in such a state of mind as i was in is not a very sharp hand at doing anything i shook from head to foot  the room was very dark  and i couldn t  for a moment or two  collect my senses sufficient really to know which way the door lay what a situation it was  dab  dab  dab  came these horrid footsteps  and there was i groping about the room in an agony  i heard them coming nearer and nearer to my door  another moment  and they must have reached it  when my hand struck against the lock what an escape no  it was not no no  indeed  the key was on the outside  and you may well guess i was not over and above disposed to open the door to get at it no  no i felt regularly bewildered  i can tell you  it seemed to me as if the very devil himself was coming down stairs hopping all the way upon one leg how terrific i felt my senses almost leaving me  but i did what i could to hold the door shut just as i heard the strange step come from the last stair on to the landing  then there was a horrid sound  and some one began trying the lock of my door what a moment yes  i can tell you it was a moment  such a moment as i don t wish to go through again  i held the door as close as i could  and did not speak  i tried to cry out help and murder  but i could not  my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth  and my strength was fast failing me horrid  horrid take a drop of ale thank you  well  i don t think this went on above two or three minutes and all the while some one tried might and main to push open the door my strength left me all at once  i had only time to stagger back a step or two  and then  as the door opened  i fainted away well  well ah  you wouldn t have said well  if you had been there  i can tell you no  but what become of you  what happened next  how did it end  what was it why  what exactly happened next after i fainted i cannot tell you  but the first thing i saw when i recovered was a candle yes  yes and then a crowd of people ah  ah and then dr  web gracious and  mrs  bulk  my housekeeper  i was in my own bed  and when i opened my eyes i heard dr  webb say he will be better soon  can no one form any idea of what it is all about  some sudden fright surely could alone have produced such an effect the lord have mercy upon me  said i upon this everybody who had been called in got round the bed  and wanted to know what had happened  but i said not a word of it  but turning to mrs  bulk  i asked her how it was she found out i had fainted why  sir  says she  i was coming up to bed as softly as i could because i knew you had gone to rest some time before  the clock was striking twelve  and as i went past it some of my clothes  i suppose caught the large weight  but it was knocked off  and down the stairs it rolled  going with such a lump from one to the other  and i couldn t catch it because it rolled so fast  that i made sure you would be awakened  so i came down to tell you what it was  and it was some time before i could get your room door open  and when i did i found you out of bed and insensible there was a general look of disappointment when this explanation was given  and one said then it was not the vampire certainly not and  after all  only a clock weight that s about it why didn t you tell us that at first because that would have spoilt the story there was a general murmur of discontent  and  after a few moments one man said  with some vivacity well  although our friend s vampyre has turned out  after all  to be nothing but a confounded clock weight  there s no disputing the fact about sir francis varney being a vampyre  and not a clock weight very true very true and what s to be done to rid the town of such a man oh  don t call him a man well  a monster ah  that s more like  i tell you what  sir  if you had got a light when you first heard the noise in your room  and gone out to see what it was  you would have spared yourself much fright ah  no doubt  it s always easy afterwards to say  if you had done this and if you had done the other  so and so would have been the effect  but there is something about the hour of midnight that makes men tremble well  said one  who had not yet spoken  i don t see why twelve at night should be a whit more disagreeable than twelve at day don t you not i now  for instance  many a party of pleasure goes to that old ruin where sir francis varney so unaccountably disappeared in broad daylight  but is there any one here who would go to it alone  and at midnight yes who i would what  and after what has happened as regards the vampyre in connection with it yes  i would i ll bet you twenty shilling you won t and i and i  cried several well  gentlemen  said the man  who certainly shewed no signs of fear i will go  and not only will i go and take all your bets  but  if i do meet the vampyre  then i ll do my best to take him prisoner and when will you go to night  he cried  and he sprang to his feet  hark ye all  i don t believe one word about vampyres  i ll go at once  it s getting late  and let any one of you  in order that you may be convinced i have been to the place  give me any article  which i will hide among the ruins  and tell you where to find it to morrow in broad daylight well  said one  that s fair  tom eccles  here s a handkerchief of mine  i should know it again among a hundred others agreed  i ll leave it in the ruins the wagers were fairly agreed upon  several handkerchiefs were handed to tom eccles  and at eleven o clock he fairly started  through the murky darkness of the night  to the old ruin where sir francis varney and marchdale were holding their most unholy conference it is one thing to talk and to accept wagers in the snug parlour of an inn  and another to go alone across a tract of country wrapped in the profound stillness of night to an ancient ruin which  in addition to the natural gloom which might well be supposed to surround it  has superadded associations which are anything but of a pleasant character tom eccles  as he was named  was one of those individuals who act greatly from impulse  he was certainly not a coward  and  perhaps really as free from superstition as most persons  but he was human  and consequently he had nerves  and he had likewise an imagination he went to his house first before he started on his errand to the ruins it was to get a horse pistol which he had  and which he duly loaded and placed in his pocket  then he wrapped himself up in a great coat  and with the air of a man quite determined upon something desperate he left the town the guests at the inn looked after him as he walked from the door of that friendly establishment  and some of them  as they saw his resolved aspect  began to quake for the amount of the wagers they had laid upon his non success however  it was resolved among them  that they would stay until half past twelve  in the expectation of his return  before they separated to while away the time  he who had been so facetious about his story of the clock weight  volunteered to tell what happened to a friend of his who went to take possession of some family property which he became possessed of as heir at law to an uncle who had died without a will having an illegitimate family unprovided for in every shape ah  nobody cares for other people s illegitimate children  and  if their parents don t provide for them  why  the workhouse is open for them  just as if they were something different from other people so they are  if their parents don t take care of them  and provide for them  nobody else will  as you say  neighbour  except when they have a fitz put to their name  which tells you they are royal bastards  and of course unlike anybody else s but go on let s know all about it  we sha n t hear what he has got to say at all  at this rate well  as i was saying  or about to say  the nephew  as soon as he heard his uncle was dead  comes and claps his seal upon everything in the house but  could he do so  inquired one of the guests i don t see what was to hinder him  replied a third  he could do so certainly but there was a son  and  as i take it  a son s nearer than a nephew any day but the son is illegitimate legitimate  or illegitimate  a son s a son  don t bother me about distinction of that sort  why  now  there was old weatherbit order  order let s hear the tale very good  gentlemen  i ll go on  if i ain t to be interrupted  but i ll say this  that an illegitimate son is no son  in the eyes of the law  or at most he s an accident quite  and ain t what he is  and so can t inherit well  that s what i call making matters plain  said one of the guests who took his pipe from his mouth to make room for the remark  now that is what i likes well  as i have proved then  resumed the speaker  the nephew was the heir  and into the house he would come  a fine affair it was too the illegitimates looking the colour of sloes  but he knew the law  and would have it put in force law s law  you know uncommonly true that  and the nephew stuck to it like a cobbler to his last he said they should go out  and they did go out  and  say what they would about their natural claims  he would not listen to them  but bundled them out and out in a pretty short space of time it was trying to them  mind you  to leave the house they had been born in with very different expectations to those which now appeared to be their fate  poor things  they looked ruefully enough  and well they might  for there was a wide world for them  and no prospect of a warm corner well  as i was saying  he had them all out and the house clear to himself now  said he  i have an open field and no favour  i don t care for no eh  what there was a sudden knocking  he thought  the door  and went and opened it  but nothing was to be seen oh  i see somebody next door  and if it wasn t  it don t matter there s nobody here  i m alone  and there s plenty of valuables in the house  that is what i call very good company  i wouldn t wish for better he turned about  looked over room after room  and satisfied himself that he was alone that the house was empty at every room he entered he paused to think over the value what it was worth  and that he was a very fortunate man in having dropped into such a good thing ah  there s the old boy s secretary  too his bureau there ll be something in that that will amuse me mightily  but i don t think i shall sit up late  he was a rum old man  to say the least of it a very odd sort of man with that he gave himself a shrug  as if some very uncomfortable feeling had come over him i ll go to bed early  and get some sleep  and then in daylight i can look after these papers  they won t be less interesting in the morning than they are now there had been some rum stories about the old man  and now the nephew seemed to think he might have let the family sleep on the premises for that night  yes  at that moment he could have found it in his heart to have paid for all the expense of their keep  had it been possible to have had them back to remain the night but that wasn t possible  for they would not have done it  but sooner have remained in the streets all night than stay there all night  like so many house dogs  employed by one who stepped in between them and their father s goods  which were their inheritance  but for one trifling circumstance a mere ceremony the night came on  and he had lights  true it was he had not been down stairs  only just to have a look  he could not tell what sort of a place it was  there were a good many odd sort of passages  that seemed to end nowhere  and others that did there were large doors  but they were all locked  and he had the keys so he didn t mind  but secured all places that were not fastened he then went up stairs again  and sat down in the room where the bureau was placed i ll be bound  said one of the guests  he was in a bit of a stew notwithstanding all his brag oh  i don t believe  said another  that anything done that is dangerous  or supposed to be dangerous  by the bravest man  is any way wholly without some uncomfortable feelings  they may not be strong enough to prevent the thing proposed to be done from being done  but they give a disagreeable sensation to the skin you have felt it  then ha  ha  ha why  at that time i slept in the churchyard for a wager  i must say i felt cold all over  as if my skin was walking about me in an uncomfortable manner but you won your wager i did and of course you slept there to be sure i did and met with nothing nothing  save a few bumps against the gravestones those were hard knocks  i should say they were  i assure you  but i lay there  and slept there  and won my wager would you do it again no and why not because of the rheumatism you caught that i did  i would give ten times my wager to get rid of them  i have them very badly come  order  order the tale  let s hear the end of that  since it has begun with all my heart  come  neighbour well  as i said  he was fidgetty  but yet he was not a man to be very easily frightened or overcome  for he was stout and bold when he shut himself up in the room  he took out a bottle of some good wine  and helped himself to drink  it was good old wine  and he soon felt himself warmed and  comforted  he could have faced the enemy if one bottle produces such an effect  he muttered  what will two do this was a question that could only be solved by trying it  and this he proceeded to do but first he drew a brace of long barrelled pistols from his coat pocket  and taking a powder flask and bullets from his pocket also  he loaded them very carefully there  said he  are my bull dogs  and rare watch dogs they are  they never bark but they bite  now  if anybody does come  it will be all up with them  tricks upon travellers ain t a safe game when i have these and now for the other bottle he drew the other bottle  and thought  if anything  it was better than the first  he drank it rather quick  to be sure  and then he began to feel sleepy and tired i think i shall go to bed  he said  that is  if i can find my way there  for it does seem to me as if the door was travelling  never mind it will make a call here again presently  and then i ll get through so saying he arose  taking the candle in his hand  he walked with a better step than might have been expected under the circumstance  true it was the candle wagged to and fro  and his shadow danced upon the wall  but still  when he got to the bed  he secured his door  put the light in a safe place  threw himself down  and was fast asleep in a few moments  or rather he fell into a doze instantaneously how long he remained in this state he knew not  but he was suddenly awakened by a loud bang  as though something heavy and flat had fallen upon the floor such  for instance  as a door  or anything of that sort he jumped up  rubbed his eyes  and could even then hear the reverberations through the house what is that  he muttered  what is that he listened  and thought he could hear something moving down stairs  and for a moment he was seized with an ague fit  but recollecting  i suppose  that there were some valuables down stairs that were worth fighting for  he carefully extinguished the light that still burned  and softly crept down stairs when he got down stairs he thought he could hear some one scramble up the kitchen stairs  and then into the room where the bureau was listening for a moment to ascertain if there were more than one  and then feeling convinced there was not  he followed into the parlour  when he heard the cabinet open by a key this was a new miracle  and one he could not understand  and then he heard the papers begin to rattle and rustle  so  drawing out one of the pistols  he cocked it  and walked in the figure instantly began to jump about  it was dressed in white in grave clothes  he was terribly nervous  and shook  so he feared to fire the pistol  but at length he did  and the report was followed by a fall and a loud groan this was very dreadful very dreadful  but all was quiet  and he lit the candle again  and approached the body to examine it  and ascertain if he knew who it was  a groan came from it  the bureau was open  and the figure clutched firmly a will in his hand the figure was dressed in grave clothes  and he started up when he saw the form and features of his own uncle  the man who was dead  who somehow or other had escaped his confinement  and found his way up here  he held his will firmly  and the nephew was so horrified and stunned  that he threw down the light  and rushed out of the room with a shout of terror  and never returned again                                    the narrator concluded  and one of the guests said and do you really believe it no  no to be sure not you don t why should i  my friend was  out of all hand  one of the greatest liars i ever came near  and why  therefore  should i believe him  i don t  on my conscience  believe one word of it it was now half past twelve  and  as tom eccles came not back  and the landlord did not feel disposed to draw any more liquor  they left the inn  and retired to their separate houses in a great state of anxiety to know the fate of their respective wagers chapter lxiv the vampire in the moonlight the false friend illustration part of the distance being accomplished towards the old ruins  tom eccles began to feel that what he had undertaken was not altogether such child s play as he had at first imagined it to be  somehow or another with a singular and uncomfortable sort of distinctness  there came across his mind every story that he had remembered of the wild and the wonderful  all the long since forgotten tales of superstition that in early childhood he had learned  came now back upon him  suggesting to his mind a thousand uncomfortable fancies of the strangest description it was not likely that when once a man  under such circumstances  got into such a frame of mind  he would readily get out of it again  while he continued surrounded by such scenes as had first called them into existence no doubt  had he turned about  and faced the inn again instead of the old ruins he would soon have shaken off these thick coming fancies but such a result was no to be expected  so long as he kept on towards the dismal place he had pledged himself to reach as he traversed meadow after meadow he began to ask himself some questions which he found that he could not answer exactly in a consolatory manner  under the present state of things among these question was the very pertinent one of it s no argument against vampyres  because i don t see the use of em is it  this he was compelled to answer as he had put it  and when  in addition  he began to recollect that  without the shadow of a doubt  sir francis varney the supposed vampyre  had been chased across the fields to that very ruin whither he was bound  and had then and there disappeared  he certainly found himself in decidedly uncomfortable and most unpromising situation no  he said  no  hang it  i won t go back now  to be made the laughing stock of the whole town  which i should be  come what may of it  i will go on as i have commenced  so i shall put on as stout a heart as i can then  having come to this resolve  he strove might and main to banish from his mind those disagreeable reminiscences that had been oppressing him  to turn his attention to subjects of a different complexion during the progress of making this endeavour  which was rather futile he came within sight of the ruins  then he slackened his pace a little telling himself  with a pardonable self deceit  that it was common ordinary caution only  which induced him to do so  and nothing at all in the shape of fear time enough  he remarked  to be afraid  when i see anything to be afraid of  which i don t see as yet  so  as all s right  i may as well put a good face upon the matter he tried to whistle a tune  but it turned out only a melancholy failure so he gave that up in despair  and walked on until he got within a hundred yards  or thereabouts  of the old ruins he thus proceeded  and bending his ear close to the ground  he listened attentively for several minutes  somehow  he fancied that a strange murmuring sound came to his ears  but he was not quite sure that it proceeded from the ruins  because it was just that sort of sound that might come from a long way off  being mellowed by distance  although perhaps  loud enough at its source well  well  he whispered to himself  it don t matter much  after all go i must  and hide the handkerchiefs somewhere  or else be laughed at besides losing my wages  the former i don t like  and the latter i cannot afford thus clinching the matter by such knock down arguments  he walked on until he was almost within the very shadow of the ruins  and  probably it was at this juncture that his footsteps may have been heard by marchdale and sir francis varney then he paused again  but all was profoundly still  and he began to think that the strange sort of murmuring noise which he had heard must have come from far off and not at all from any person or persons within the ruins let me see  he said to himself  i have five handkerchiefs to hide among the old ruins somewhere  and the sooner i do so the better because then i will get away  for  as regards staying here to watch heaven knows how long  for sir francis varney  i don t intend to do it upon second thoughts and second thoughts  they say  are generally best with the most careful footsteps now  as if he were treading upon some fragile substance  which he feared to injure  he advanced until he was fairly within the precincts of the ancient place  which now bore so ill a reputation he then made to himself much the same remark that sir francis varney had made to marchdale  with respect to the brightening up of the sky  in consequence of its being near the time for the moon to rise from the horizon  and he saw more clearly around him  although he could not find any good place to hide the handkerchiefs in i must and will  he said  hide them securely  for it would  indeed be remarkably unpleasant  after coming here and winning my wages  to have the proofs that i had done so taken away by some chance visitor to the place he at length saw a tolerably large stone  which stood  in a slant position  up against one of the walls  its size attracted him  he thought  if his strength was sufficient to move it  that it would be a good thing to do so  and to place the handkerchiefs beneath it  for  at all events  it was so heavy that it could not be kicked aside  and no one  without some sort of motive to do so  beyond the mere love of labour  would set about moving it from its position i may go further and fare worse  he said to himself  so here shall all the handkerchiefs lie  to afford a proof that i have been here he packed them into a small compass  and then stooped to roll aside the heavy stone  when  at the moment  before he could apply his strength to that purpose  he heard some one  in his immediate neighbourhood say hist this was so sudden  and so utterly unexpected  that he not only ceased his exertions to move the stone  but he nearly fell down in his surprise hist hist  said the voice again what what  gasped tom eccles what are you hush hush hush the perspiration broke out upon his brow  and he leaned against the wall for support  as he managed to say  faintly well  hush what then hist well  i hear you  where are you here at hand  who are you tom eccles  who are you a friend  have you seen anything no  i wish i could  i should like to see you if i could i m coming there was a slow and cautious footstep  and marchdale advanced to where tom eccles was standing come  now  said the latter  when he saw the dusky looking form stalking towards him  till i know you better  i ll be obliged to you to keep off  i am well armed  keep your distance  be you friend or foe armed  exclaimed marchdale  and he at once paused yes  i am but i am a friend  i have no sort of objection frankly to tell you my errand  i am a friend of the bannerworth family  and have kept watch here now for two nights  in the hopes of meeting with varney  the vampyre the deuce you have  and pray what may your name be marchdale if you be mr  marchdale  i know you by sight  for i have seen you with mr  henry bannerworth several times  come out from among the shadows and let us have a look at you  but  till you do  don t come within arm s length of me  i am not naturally suspicious  but we cannot be too careful oh  certainly certainly  the silver edge of the moon is now just peeping up from the east  and you will be able to see me well  if you step from the shadow of the wall by which you now are this was a reasonable enough proposition  and tom eccles at once acceded to it  by stepping out boldly into the partial moonlight  which now began to fall upon the open meadows  tinting the grass with a silvery refulgence  and rendering even minute objects visible  the moment he saw marchdale he knew him  and  advancing frankly to him  he said i know you  sir  well and what brings you here a wager for one thing  and a wish to see the vampyre for another indeed yes  i must own i have such a wish  along with a still stronger one  to capture him  if possible  and  as there are now two of us  why may we not do it as for capturing him  said marchdale  i should prefer shooting him you would i would  indeed  i have seen him once shot down  and he is now  i have no doubt  as well as ever  what were you doing with that huge stone i saw you bending over i have some handkerchiefs to hide here  as a proof that i have to night really been to this place oh  i will show you a better spot  where there is a crevice in which you can place them with perfect safety  will you walk with me into the ruins willingly it s odd enough  remarked marchdale  after he had shown tom eccles where to hide the handkerchiefs  that you and i should both be here upon so similar an errand i m very glad of it  it robs the place of its gloom  and makes it ten times more endurable than it otherwise would be  what do you propose to do if you see the vampyre i shall try a pistol bullet on him  you say you are armed yes with pistols one  here it is a huge weapon  loaded well  of course oh  yes  i can depend upon it  but i did not intend to use it  unless assailed tis well  what is that what what don t you see anything there  come farther back  look look  at the corner of that wall there i am certain there is the flutter of a human garment there is there is hush  keep close  it must be the vampyre give me my pistol  what are you doing with it only ramming down the charge more firmly for you  take it  if that be varney the vampyre  i shall challenge him to surrender the moment he appears  and if he does not  i will fire upon him  and do you do so likewise well  i i don t know you have scruples i certainly have well  well don t you fire  then  but leave it to me  there look look  now have you any doubt  there he goes  in his cloak  it is it is varney  by heavens  cried tom eccles illustration surrender  shouted marchdale at the instant sir francis varney sprang forward  and made off at a rapid pace across the meadows fire after him fire  cried marchdale  or he will escape  my pistol has missed fire  he will be off on the impulse of the moment  and thus urged by the voice and the gesture of his companion  tom eccles took aim as well as he could  and fired after the retreating form of sir francis varney  his conscience smote him as he heard the report and saw the flash of the large pistol amid the half sort of darkness that was still around the effect of the shot was then to him painfully apparent  he saw varney stop instantly  then make a vain attempt to stagger forward a little and finally fall heavily to the earth  with all the appearance of one killed upon the spot you have hit him  said marchdale you have hit him  bravo i have hit him yes  a capital shot  by jove i am very sorry sorry  sorry for ridding the world of such a being  what was in your pistol a couple of slugs well  they have made a lodgment in him  that s quite clear  let s go up and finish him at once he seems finished i beg your pardon there  when the moonbeams fall upon him he ll get up and walk away as if nothing was the matter will he  cried tom  with animation will he certainly he will thank god for that  now  hark you  mr  marchdale i should not have fired if you had not at the moment urged me to do so now  i shall stay and see if the effect which you talk of will ensue and although it may convince me that he is a vampyre  and that there are such things  he may go off  scot free  for me go off yes  i don t want to have even a vampyre s blood upon my hands you are exceedingly delicate perhaps i am  it s my way  though  i have shot him not you  mind  so  in a manner of speaking  he belongs to me  now  mark  me  i won t have him touched any more to night  unless you think there s a chance of making a prisoner of him without violence there he lies  you can go and make a prisoner of him at once  dead as he is  and if you take him out of the moonlight i understand  he won t recover certainly not but  as i want him to recover  that don t suit me well  i cannot but honour your scruples  although i do not actually share in them  but i promise you that  since such is your wish  i will take no steps against the vampyre  but let us come up to him and see if he be really dead  or only badly wounded tom eccles hang back a little from this proposal  but  upon being urged again by marchdale  and told that he need not go closer than he chose he consented  and the two of them approached the prostrate form of sir francis varney  which lay upon its face in the faint moonlight  which each moment was gathering strength and power he lies upon his face  said marchdale  will you go and turn him over who i  god forbid i should touch him well well  i will  come on they halted within a couple of yards of the body  tom eccles would not go a step farther  so marchdale advanced alone  and pretended to be with great repugnance  examining for the wound he is quite dead  he said  but i cannot see the hurt i think he turned his head as i fired did he  let us see marchdale lifted up the head  and disclosed such a mass of clotted looking blood  that tom eccles at once took to his heels  nor stopped until he was nearly as far off as the ruins  marchdale followed him more slowly  and when he came up to him  he said the slugs have taken effect on his face i know it i know it  don t tell me he looks horrible and i am a murderer psha  you look upon this matter too seriously  think of who and what he was  and then you will soon acquit yourself of being open to any such charge i am bewildered  mr  marchdale  and cannot now know whether he be a vampyre or not  if he be not  i have murdered  most unjustifiably  a fellow creature well  but if he be why  even then i do not know but that i ought to consider myself as guilty  he is one of god s creatures if he were ten times a vampyre well  you really do take a serious view of the affair not more serious than it deserves and what do you mean to do i shall remain here to await the result of what you tell me will ensue  if he be a real vampire  even now the moonbeams are full upon him  and each moment increasing in intensity think you he will recover i do indeed then here will i wait since that is you resolve  i will keep you company  we shall easily find some old stone in the ruins which will serve us for a seat  and there at leisure we can keep our eyes upon the dead body  and be able to observe if it make the least movement this plan was adopted  and they sat down just within the ruins  but in such a place that they had a full view of the dead body  as it appeared to be  of sir francis varney  upon which the sweet moonbeams shone full and clear tom eccles related how he was incited to come upon his expedition  but he might have spared himself that trouble  as marchdale had been in a retired corner of the inn parlour before he came to his appointment with varney  and heard the business for the most part proposed half an hour  certainly not more  might have elapsed  when suddenly tom eccles uttered an exclamation  partly of surprise and partly of terror he moves  he moves  he cried  look at the vampyre s body marchdale affected to look with an all absorbing interest  and there was sir francis varney  raising slowly one arm with the hand outstretched towards the moon  as if invoking that luminary to shed more of its beams upon him  then the body moved slowly  like some one writhing in pain and yet unable to move from the spot on which it lay  from the head to the foot  the whole frame seemed to be convulsed  and now and then as the ghastly object seemed to be gathering more strength  the limbs were thrown out with a rapid and a frightful looking violence it was truly to one  who might look upon it as a reality and no juggle a frightful sight to see  and although marchdale  of course  tolerably well preserved his equanimity  only now and then  for appearance sake affecting to be wonderfully shocked  poor tom eccles was in such a state of horror and fright that he could not  if he would  have flown from the spot  so fascinated was he by the horrible spectacle this was a state of things which continued for many minutes  and then the body showed evident symptoms of so much returning animation  that it was about to rise from his gory bed and mingle once again with the living behold  said marchdale behold heaven have mercy upon us it is as i said  the beams of the moon have revived the vampyre  you perceive now that there can be no doubt yes  yes  i see him  i see him sir francis varney now  as if with a great struggle  rose to his feet and looked up at the bright moon for some moments with such an air and manner that it would not have required any very great amount of imagination to conceive that he was returning to it some sort of thanksgiving for the good that it had done to him he then seemed for some moments in a state of considerable indecision as to which way he should proceed  he turned round several times  then he advanced a step or two towards the house  but apparently his resolution changed again  and casting his eyes upon the ruins  he at once made towards them this was too much for the philosophy as well as for the courage of tom eccles  it was all very well to look on at some distance  and observe the wonderful and inexplicable proceedings of the vampyre  but when he showed symptoms of making a nearer acquaintance  it was not to be borne why  he s coming here  said tom he seems so indeed  remarked marchdale do you mean to stay i think i shall you do  do you yes  i should much like to question him  and as we are two to one i think we really can have nothing to fear do you  i m altogether of a different opinion  a man who has more lives than a cat don t much mind at what odds he fights  you may stay if you like you do not mean to say that you will desert me i don t see a bit how you call it deserting you  if we had come out together on this adventure  i would have stayed it out with you  but as we came separate and independent  we may as well go back so well but good morning  cried tom  and he at once took to his heels towards the town  without staying to pay any attention to the remonstrances of marchdale  who called after him in vain sir francis varney  probably  had tom eccles not gone off so rapidly would have yet taken another thought  and gone in another direction than that which led him to the ruins  and tom  if he had had his senses fully about him  as well as all his powers of perception  would have seen that the progress of the vampyre was very slow  while he continued to converse with marchdale  and that it was only when he went off at good speed that sir francis varney likewise thought it prudent to do so is he much terrified  said varney  as he came up to marchdale yes most completely this then  will make a good story in the town it will  indeed  and not a little enhance your reputation well  well  it don t much matter now  but if by terrifying people i can purchase for myself anything like immunity for the past  i shall be satisfied i think you may now safely reckon that you have done so this man who has fled with so much precipitation  had courage unquestionably or else he would have shrunk from coming here at all true  but his courage and presence arose from his strong doubts as to the existence of such beings as vampyres yes  and now that he is convinced  his bravery has evaporated along with his doubts  and such a tale as he has now to tell  will be found sufficient to convert even the most sceptical in the town i hope so and yet it cannot much avail you not personally  but i must confess that i am not dead to all human opinions  and i feel some desire of revenge against those dastards who by hundreds have hunted me  burnt down my mansion  and sought my destruction that i do not wonder at i would fain leave among them a legacy of fear  such fear as shall haunt them and their children for years to come  i would wish that the name of varney  the vampire  should be a sound of terror for generations it will be so it shall and now  then  for a consideration of what is to be done with our prisoner  what is your resolve upon that point i have considered it while i was lying upon yon green sward waiting for the friendly moonbeams to fall upon my face  and it seems to me that there is no sort of resource but to kill him no  no what then to set him free nay  have you considered the immense hazard of doing so  think again  i pray you think again  i am decidedly of opinion that he more than suspects who are his enemies  and  in that case  you know what consequences would ensue  besides  have we not enough already to encounter  why should we add another young  bold  determined spirit to the band which is already arrayed against us you talk in vain  marchdale  i know to what it all tends  you have a strong desire for the death of this young man no  there you wrong me  i have no desire for his death  for its own sake  but  where great interests are at stake  there must be sacrifices made so there must  therefore  i will make a sacrifice  and let this young prisoner free from his dungeon if such be your determination  i know well it is useless to combat with it  when do you purpose giving him his freedom i will not act so heedlessly as that your principles of caution shall blame me  i will attempt to get from him some promise that he will not make himself an active instrument against me  perchance  too  as bannerworth hall  which he is sure to visit  wears such an air of desertion  i may be able to persuade him that the bannerworth family  as well as his uncle  have left this part of the country altogether  so that  without making any inquiry for them about the neighbourhood  he may be induced to leave at once that would be well good  your prudence approves of the plan  and therefore it shall be done i am rather inclined to think  said marchdale  with a slight tone of sarcasm  that if my prudence did not approve of the plan  it would still be done most probably  said varney  calmly will you release him to night it is morning  now  and soon the soft grey light of day will tint the east  i do not think i will release him till sunset again now  has he provision to last him until then he has well  then  two hours after sunset i will come here and release him from his weary bondage  and now i must go to find some place in which to hide my proscribed head  as for bannerworth hall  i will yet have it in my power  i have sworn to do so  i will keep my oath the accomplishment of our purpose  i regret to say  seems as far off as ever not so not so  as i before remarked  we must disappear  for a time  so as to lull suspicion  there will then arise a period when bannerworth hall will neither be watched  as it is now  nor will it be inhabited a period before the bannerworth family has made up its mind to go back to it  and when long watching without a result has become too tiresome to be continued at all  then we can at once pursue our object be it so and now  marchdale  i want more money more money yes  you know well that i have had large demands of late but i certainly had an impression that you were possessed  by the death of some one  with very ample means yes  but there is a means by which all is taken from me  i have no real resources but what are rapidly used up  so i must come upon you again i have already completely crippled myself as regards money matters in this enterprise  and i do certainly hope that the fruits will not be far distant  if they be much longer delayed  i shall really not know what to do  however  come to the lodge where you have been staying and then i will give you  to the extent of my ability  whatever sum you think your present exigencies require come on  then  at once  i would certainly  of course  rather leave this place now  before daybreak  come on  i say  come on sir francis varney and marchdale walked for some time in silence across the meadows  it was evident that there was not between these associates the very best of feelings  marchdale was always smarting under an assumption of authority over him  on the part of sir francis varney while the latter scarcely cared to conceal any portion of the contempt with which he regarded his hypocritical companion some very strong band of union  indeed  must surely bind these two strange persons together  it must be something of a more than common nature which induces marchdale not only to obey the behests of his mysterious companion  but to supply him so readily with money as we perceive he promises to do and  as regards varney  the vampyre  he  too  must have some great object in view to induce him to run such a world of risk  and take so much trouble as he was doing with the bannerworth family what his object is  and what is the object of marchdale  will  now that we have progressed so far in our story  soon appear  and then much that is perfectly inexplicable  will become clear and distinct  and we shall find that some strong human motives are at the bottom of it all chapter lxv varney s visit to the dungeon of the lonely prisoner in the ruins illustration evident it was that marchdale was not near so scrupulous as sir francis varney  in what he chose to do  he would  without hesitation  have sacrificed the life of that prisoner in the lonely dungeon  whom it would be an insult to the understanding of our readers  not to presume that they had  long ere this  established in their minds to be charles holland his own safety seemed to be the paramount consideration with marchdale and it was evident that he cared for nothing in comparison with that object it says much  however  for sir francis varney  that he did not give in to such a blood thirsty feeling  but rather chose to set the prisoner free  and run all the chances of the danger to which he might expose himself by such a course of conduct  than to insure safety comparatively  by his destruction sir francis varney is evidently a character of strangely mixed feelings it is quite evident that he has some great object in view  which he wishes to accomplish almost at any risk  but it is equally evident  at the same time  that he wishes to do so with the least possible injury to others  or else he would never have behaved as he had done in his interview with the beautiful and persecuted flora bannerworth  or now suggested the idea of setting charles holland free from the dreary dungeon in which he had been so long confined we are always anxious and willing to give every one credit for the good that is in them  and  hence  we are pleased to find that sir francis varney  despite his singular  and apparently preternatural capabilities has something sufficiently human about his mind and feelings  to induce him to do as little injury as possible to others in the pursuit of his own objects of the two  vampyre as he is  we prefer him much to the despicable and hypocritical  marchdale  who  under the pretence of being the friend of the bannerworth family  would freely have inflicted upon them the most deadly injuries it was quite clear that he was most dreadfully disappointed that sir francis varney  would not permit him to take the life of charles holland  and it was with a gloomy and dissatisfied air that he left the ruins to proceed towards the town  after what we may almost term the altercation he had had with varney the vampyre upon that subject it must not be supposed that sir francis varney  however  was blind to the danger which must inevitably accrue from permitting charles holland once more to obtain his liberty what the latter would be able to state would be more than sufficient to convince the bannerworths  and all interested in their fortunes  that something was going on of a character  which  however  supernatural it might seem to be  still seemed to have some human and ordinary objects for its ends sir francis varney thought over all this before he proceeded  according to his promise  to the dungeon of the prisoner  but it would seem as if there was considerable difficulty  even to an individual of his long practice in all kinds of chicanery and deceit  in arriving at any satisfactory conclusion  as to a means of making charles holland s release a matter of less danger to himself  than it would be likely to be  if  unfettered by obligation  he was at once set free at the solemn hour of midnight  while all was still  that is  to say  on the night succeeding the one  on which he had had the interview with marchdale  we have recorded  sir francis varney alone sought the silent ruins  he was attired  as usual  in his huge cloak  and  indeed  the chilly air of the evening warranted such protection against its numerous discomforts had any one seen him  however  that evening  they would have observed an air of great doubt  and irresolution upon his brow  as if he were struggling with some impulses which he found it extremely difficult to restrain i know well  he muttered  as he walked among the shadow of the ruins that marchdale s reasoning is coldly and horribly correct  when he says that there is danger in setting this youth free  but  i am about to leave this place  and not to show myself for some time  and i cannot reconcile myself to inflicting upon him the horror of a death by starvation  which must ensue it was a night of more than usual dullness  and  as sir francis varney removed the massy stone  which hid the narrow and tortuous entrance to the dungeons  a chilly feeling crept over him  and he could not help supposing  that even then marchdale might have played him false  and neglected to supply the prisoner food  according to his promise hastily he descended to the dungeons  and with a step  which had in it far less of caution  than had usually characterised his proceedings  he proceeded onwards until he reached that particular dungeon  in which our young friend  to whom we wished so well  had been so long confined from the beautiful and cheering light of day  and from all that his heart s best affections most cling to speak  said sir francis varney  as he entered the dungeon if the occupant of this dreary place live  let him answer one who is as much his friend as he has been his enemy i have no friend  said charles holland  faintly  unless it be one who would come and restore me to liberty and how know you that i am not he your voice sounds like that of one of my persecutors  why do you not place the climax to your injuries by at once taking away life  i should be better pleased that you would do so  than that i should wear out the useless struggle of existence in so dreary and wretched an abode as this young man  said sir francis varney  i have come to you on a greater errand of mercy than  probably  you will ever give me credit for  there is one who would too readily have granted your present request  and who would at once have taken that life of which you profess to be so wearied  but which may yet present to you some of its sunniest and most beautiful aspects your tones are friendly  said charles  but yet i dread some new deception  that you are one of those who consigned me by stratagem  and by brute force  to this place of durance  i am perfectly well assured and  therefore  any good that may be promised by you  presents itself to me in a very doubtful character i cannot be surprised  said sir francis varney  at such sentiments arising from your lips  but  nevertheless  i am inclined to save you you have been detained here because it was supposed by being so  a particular object would be best obtained by your absence  that object however has failed  notwithstanding  and i do not feel further inclined to protract your sufferings  have you any guess as to the parties who have thus confined you i am unaccustomed to dissemble  and therefore i will say at once that i have a guess in which way does it tend against sir francis varney  called the vampyre does it not strike you that this may be a dangerous candour it may or it may not be  i cannot help it  i know i am at the mercy of my foes and i do not believe that anything i can say or do will make my situation worse or better you are much mistaken there  in other hands than mine  it might make it much worse  but it happens to be one of my weaknesses  that i am charged with candour  and that i admire boldness of disposition indeed  and yet can behave in the manner you have done towards me yes  there are more things in heaven and on earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy  i am the more encouraged to set you free  because  if i procure from you a promise  which i intend to attempt  i am inclined to believe that you will keep it i shall assuredly keep whatever promise i may make  propound your conditions  and if they be such as honour and honesty will permit me to accede to  i will do so willingly and at once  heaven knows i am weary enough of this miserable imprisonment will you promise me then  if i set you free  not to mention your suspicions that it is to sir francis varney you owe this ill turn  and not to attempt any act of vengeance against him as a retaliation for it i cannot promise so much as that  freedom  indeed  would be a poor boon  if i were not permitted freely to converse of some of the circumstances connected with my captivity you object i do to the former of your propositions  but not to the latter  i will promise not to go at all out of my way to execute any vengeance upon you  but i will not promise that i will not communicate the circumstances of my forced absence from them  to those friends whose opinion i so much value  and to return to whom is almost as dear to me as liberty itself sir francis varney was silent for a few moments  and then he said  in a tone of deep solemnity there are ninety nine persons out of a hundred who would take your life for the independence of your tongue  but i am as the hundredth one  who looks with a benevolent eye at your proceedings  will you promise me  if i remove the fetters which now bind your limbs  that you will make no personal attack upon me  for i am weary of personal contention  and i have no disposition to endure it  will you make me this promise i promise i will without another word  but trusting implicitly to the promise which had been given to him  sir francis varney produced a small key from his pocket  and unlocked with it a padlock which confined the chains about the prisoner with ease  charles holland was then enabled to shake them off  and then for the first time  for some weeks  he rose to his feet  and felt all the exquisite relief of being comparatively free from bondage this is delightful  indeed  he said it is  said sir francis varney it is but a foretaste of the happiness you will enjoy when you are entirely free  you see that i have trusted you you have trusted me as you might trust me  and you perceive that i have kept my word you have  and since you decline to make me the promise which i would fain have from you  to the effect that you would not mention me as one of the authors of your calamity  i must trust to your honour not to attempt revenge for what you have suffered that i will promise  there can be but little difficulty to any generous mind in giving up such a feeling  in consequence of your sparing me what you might still further have inflicted  i will let the past rest  and as if it had never happened really to me  and speak of it to others  but as a circumstance which i wish not to revert to  but prefer should be buried in oblivion it is well  and now i have a request to make of you  which  perhaps you will consider the hardest of all name it  i feel myself bound to a considerable extent to comply with whatever you may demand of me  that is not contrary to honourable principle then it is this  that  comparatively free as you are  and in a condition  as you are  to assert your own freedom  you will not do so hastily  or for a considerable period  in fact  i wish and expect that you should wait yet awhile  until it shall suit me to say that it is my pleasure that you shall be free that is  indeed  a hard condition to man who feels  as you yourself remark  that he can assert his freedom  it is one which i have still a hope you will not persevere in nay  young man  i think that i have treated you with generosity  to make you feel that i am not the worst of foes you could have had  all i require of you is  that you should wait here for about an hour  it is now nearly one o clock  will you wait until you hear it strike two before you actually make a movement to leave this place charles holland hesitated for some moments  and then he said do not fancy that i am not one who appreciates the singular trust you have reposed in me  and  however repugnant to me it may be to remain here  a voluntary prisoner  i am inclined to do so  if it be but to convince you that the trust you have reposed in me is not in vain  and that i can behave with equal generosity to you as you can to me be it so  said sir francis varney  i shall leave you with a full reliance that you will keep your word  and now  farewell  when you think of me  fancy me rather one unfortunate than criminal  and tell yourself that even varney the vampyre had some traits in his character  which although they might not raise your esteem  at all events did not loudly call for your reprobation i shall do so  oh  flora  flora  i shall look upon you once again after believing and thinking that i had bidden you a long and last adieu  my own beautiful flora  it is joy indeed to think that i shall look upon that face again  which  to my perception  is full of all the majesty of loveliness sir francis varney looked coldly on while charles uttered this enthusiastic speech remember  he said  till two o clock  and he walked towards the door of the dungeon  you will have no difficulty in finding your way out from this place  doubtless you already perceive the entrance by which i gained admission had i been free  said charles  and had the use of my limbs  i should long ere this  have worked my way to life and liberty tis well  goodnight varney walked from the place  and just closed the door behind him  with a slow and stately step he left the ruins  and charles holland found himself once more alone  but in a much more enviable condition than for many weeks he could have called his chapter lxvi flora bannerworth s apparent inconsistency the admiral s circumstances and advice mr  chillingworth s mysterious absence illustration for a brief space let us return to flora bannerworth  who had suffered so much on account of her affections  as well as on account of the mysterious attack that had been made upon her by the reputed vampyre after leaving bannerworth hall for a short time  she seemed to recover her spirits  but this was a state of things which did not last  and only showed how fallacious it was to expect that  after the grievous things that had happened  she would rapidly recover her equanimity it is said  by learned physiologists  that two bodily pains cannot endure at the same space of time in the system  and  whether it be so or not  is a question concerning which it would be foreign to the nature of our work  to enter into anything like an elaborate disquisition certainly  however  so far as flora bannerworth was concerned  she seemed inclined to show that  mentally  the observation was a true one for that  now she became released from a continued dread of the visits of the vampyre  her mind would  with more painful interest than ever recur to the melancholy condition  probably  of charles holland  if he were alive  and to soul harrowing reflections concerning him  if he were dead she could not  and she did not  believe  for one moment  that his desertion of her had been of a voluntary character  she knew  or fancied she knew  him by far too well for that  and she more than once expressed her opinion  to the effect that she was perfectly convinced his disappearance was a part and parcel of all that train of circumstances which had so recently occurred  and produced such a world of unhappiness to her  as well as to the whole of the bannerworth family if he had never loved me  she said to her brother henry  he would have been alive and well  but he has fallen a victim to the truth of a passion  and to the constancy of an affection which  to my dying day  i will believe in now that mr  marchdale had left the place there was no one to dispute this proposition with flora  for all  as well as she  were fully inclined to think well of charles holland it was on the very morning which preceded that evening when sir francis varney called upon charles holland in the manner we have related  with the gratifying news that  upon certain conditions  he might be released that flora bannerworth  when the admiral came to see them  spoke to him of charles holland  saying now  sir  that i am away from bannerworth hall  i do not  and cannot feel satisfied  for the thought that charles may eventually come back and seek us there  still haunts me  fancy him  sir  doing so  and seeing the place completely deserted well  there s something in that  said the admiral  but  however  he s hardly such a goose  if it were so to happen  to give up the chase he d find us out somehow you think he would  sir  or  do you not think that despair would seize upon him  and that  fancying we had all left the spot for ever  he might likewise do so  so that we should lose him more effectually than we have done at present no  hardly  said the admiral  he couldn t be such a goose as that why  when i was of his age  if i had secured the affections of a young girl like you  i d have gone over all the world  but i d have found out where she was  and what i mean to say is  if he s half such a goose as you think him  he deserves to lose you did you not tell me something  sir  of mr  chillingworth talking of taking possession of the hall for a brief space of time why  yes  i did  and i expect he is there now  in fact  i m sure he s there  for he said he would be no  he ain t  said jack pringle  at that moment entering the room you re wrong again  as you always are  somehow or other what  you vagabond  are you here  you mutinous rascal ay  ay  sir go on  don t mind me  i wonder what you d do  sir  if you hadn t somebody like me to go on talking about why  you infernal rascal  i wonder what you d do if you had not an indulgent commander  who puts up even with real mutiny  and says nothing about it  but where have you been  did you go as i directed you  and take some provisions to bannerworth hall yes  i did  but i brought them back again  there s nobody there  and don t seem likely to be  except a dead body a dead body  whose body can that be tom somebody  for i m d d if it ain t a great he cat you scoundrel  how dare you alarm me in such a way  but do you mean to tell me that you did not see dr  chillingworth at the hall how could i see him  if he wasn t there but he was there  he said he would be there then he s gone again for there s nobody there that i know of in the shape of a doctor  i went through every part of the ship i mean the house and the deuce a soul could i find  so as it was rather lonely and uncomfortable  i came away again  who knows  thought i  but some blessed vampyre or another may come across me this won t do  said the old admiral  buttoning up his coat to the chin  bannerworth hall must not be deserted in this way  it is quite clear that sir francis varney and his associates have some particular object in view in getting possession of the place  here  you jack ay  ay  sir illustration just go back again  and stay at the hall till somebody comes to you even such a stupid hound as you will be something to scare away unwelcome visitors  go back to the hall  i say  what are you staring at back to bannerworth hall  said jack  what  just where i ve come from  all that way off  and nothing to eat  and  what s worse  nothing to drink  i ll see you d d first the admiral caught up a table fork  and made a rush at jack  but henry bannerworth interfered no  no  he said  admiral  no  no not that  you must recollect that you yourself have given this  no doubt  faithful fellow of your s liberty to do and say a great many things which don t look like good service  but i have no doubt  from what i have seen of his disposition that he would risk his life rather than  that you should come to any harm ay  ay  said jack  he quite forgets when the bullets were scuttling our nobs off cape ushant  when that big frenchman had hold of him by the skirf  of his neck  and began pummelling his head  and the lee scuppers were running with blood  and a bit of joe wiggins s brains had come slap in my eye  while some of jack marling s guts was hanging round my neck like a nosegay  all in consequence of grape shot then he didn t say as i was a swab  when i came up  and bored a hole in the frenchman s back with a pike  ay  it s all very well now  when there s peace  and no danger  to call jack pringle a lubberly rascal  and mutinous  i m blessed if it ain t enough to make an old pair of shoes faint away why  you infernal scoundrel  said the admiral  nothing of the sort ever happened  and you know it  jack  you re no seaman werry good said jack  then  if i ain t no seaman  you are what shore going people calls a jolly fat old humbug jack  hold your tongue  said henry bannerworth  you carry these things too far  you know very well that your master esteems you  and you should not presume too much upon that fact my master  said jack don t call him my master  i never had a master  and don t intend  he s my admiral  if you like  but an english sailor don t like a master i tell you what it is  jack  said the admiral  you ve got your good qualities  i admit ay  ay  sir that s enough  you may as well leave off well while you can but i ll just tell you what you resemble more than anything else chew me up  what may that be  sir a french marine a what  a french marine  good bye  i wouldn t say another word to you  if you was to pay me a dollar a piece  of all the blessed insults rolled into one  this here s the worstest  you might have called me a marine  or you might have called me a frenchman  but to make out that i m both a marine and a frenchman  d me  if it isn t enough to make human nature stand on an end  now  i ve done with you and a good job  too  said the admiral  i wish i d thought of it before  you re worse than a third day s ague  or a hot and a cold fever in the tropics very good  said jack  i only hope providence will have mercy upon you  and keep an eye upon you when i m gone  otherwise i wonder what will become of you  it wasn t so when young belinda  who you took off the island of antiggy  in the ingies  jumped overboard  and i went after her in a heavy swell  howsomdever  never mind  you shook hands with me then  and while a bushel of the briny was weeping out of the corner of each of your blinkers  you says  says you hold  cried the admiral  hold  i know what i said  jack  it s cut a fathom deep in my memory  give us your fist  jack  and and hold yourself  said jack  i know what you re going to say  and i won t hear you say it so there s an end of it  lor bless you  i knows you  i ain t a going to leave you  don t be afraid  i only works you up  and works you down again  just to see if there s any of that old spirit in you when we was aboard the victory  don t you recollect  admiral yes yes  enough  jack why  let me see that was a matter of forty years ago  nearly  when i was a youngster there there  jack that ll do  you bring the events of other years fresh upon my memory  peace peace  i have not forgotten  but still  to hear what you know of them  if recited  would give the old man a pang a pang  said jack  i suppose that s some dictionary word for a punch in the eye  that would be mutiny with a vengeance  so i m off go  go i m a going  and just to please you  i ll go to the hall  so you sha n t say that you told me to do anything that i didn t away went jack  whistling an air  that might have been popular when he and the admiral were young  and henry bannerworth could not but remark that an appearance of great sadness came over the old man  when jack was gone i fear  sir  he said  that heedless sailor has touched upon some episode in your existence  the wounds of which are still fresh enough to give you pain it is so  said the old admiral  just look at me now  do i look like the hero of a romantic love story not exactly  i admit well  notwithstanding that  jack pringle has touched a chord that vibrates in my heart yet  replied the admiral have you any objection to tell me of it none  whatever  and perhaps  by the time i have done  the doctor may have found his way back again  or jack may bring us some news of him  so here goes for a short but a true yarn chapter lxvii the admiral s story of the beautiful belinda illustration just at this moment flora bannerworth stole into the room from whence she had departed a short time since  but when she saw that old admiral bell was looking so exceedingly serious  and apparently about to address henry upon some very important subject  she would have retired  but he turned towards her  and said my story  my dear  i ve no objection to your hearing  and  like all women folks  a love story never comes amiss to you  so you may as well stay and hear it a love story  said flora  you tell a love story sir yes  my dear  and not only tell it  but be the hero of it  likewise ain t you astonished i am  indeed well  you ll be more astonished then before i ve done  so just listen as jack pringle says  it was the matter of about somewhere forty years ago  that i was in command of the victory frigate  which was placed upon the west indian station  during a war then raging  for the protection of our ports and harbours in that vicinity  we d not a strong force in that quarter  therefore  i had to cut about from place to place  and do the best i could  after a time  though  i rather think that we frightened off the enemy  during which time i chiefly anchored off the island of antigua  and was hospitably received at the house of a planter  of the name of marchant  who  in fact  made his house my home  and introduced me to all the elite  of the society of the island  ah  miss flora you ve no idea  to look at me now  what i was then  i held a captain s commission  and was nearly the youngest man in the service  with such a rank  i was as slender  ay  as a dancing master  these withered and bleached locks were black as the raven s plume  ay  ay  but no matter the planter had a daughter and you loved her  said flora loved her  said the old man  and the flush of youthful animation come to his countenance  loved her  do you say  i adored her  i worshipped her  she was to me but what a d d old fool  i am  we ll skip that if you please nay  nay  said flora  that is what i want to hear i haven t the least doubt of that  in the world  but that s just what you won t hear none of your nonsense  miss flora  the old man may be a fool  but he isn t quite an idiot he s neither  said flora  true feelings can never disgrace any one perhaps not  but  however  to make a long story short  somehow or other  one day  belinda was sitting alone  and i rudely pounced upon her  i rather think then i must have said something that i oughtn t to have said  for it took her so aback  i was forced  somehow or other  to hold her up  and then i i yes  i m sure i kissed her  and so  i told her i loved her  and then  what do you think she said why  said flora  that she reciprocated the passion d n my rags said jack  who at the moment came into the room  i suppose that s the name of some shell or other you here  you villain  said the admiral  i thought you were gone so i was  said jack  but i came back for my hat  you see away he went again  and the admiral resumed his story well  miss flora  he said  you haven t made a good guess  as she didn t say anything at all  she only clung to me like some wild bird to its mother s breast  and cried as if her heart would break indeed yes  i didn t know the cause of her emotion  but at last i got it out of her what was it oh  a mere trifle  she was already married to somebody else  that s all  some d d fellow  who had gone trading about the islands  a fellow she didn t care a straw about  that was old enough to be her father and you left her no  i didn t  guess again  i was a mad headed youngster  i only felt i didn t think  i persuaded her to come away with me  i took her aboard my ship  and set sail with her  a few weeks flew like hours  but one day we were hailed by a vessel  and when we neared her  she manned a boat and brought a letter on board  addressed to belinda  it was from her father  written in his last moments  it began with a curse and ended with a blessing  there was a postscript in another hand  to say the old man died of grief  she read it by my side on the quarter deck  it dropped from her grasp  and she plunged into the sea  jack pringle went after her  but i never saw her again gracious heavens  what a tragedy yes  tolerable  said the old man he arose and took his hat and placed it on his head  he gave the crown of it a blow that sent it nearly over his eyes  he thrust his hands deep into his breeches pockets  clenched his teeth  and muttered something inaudible as he strode from the apartment who would have thought  henry  said flora  that such a man as admiral bell had been the hero of such an adventure ay  who indeed  but it shows that we never can judge from appearances  flora  and that those who seem to us the most heart whole may have experienced the wildest vicissitudes of passion and we must remember  likewise  that this was forty years ago  henry which makes a material difference in the state of the case as regards admiral bell it does indeed more than half a lifetime  and yet how evident it was that his old feelings clung to him  i can well imagine the many hours of bitter regret which the memory of this his lost love must have given him true true  i can feel something for him  for have i not lost one who loved me a worse loss  too  than that which admiral bell relates  for am i not a prey to all the horrors of uncertainty  whereas he knew the worst  and that  at all events  death had claimed its victim  leaving nothing to conjecture in the shape of suffering  so that the mind had nothing to do but to recover slowly  but surely  as it would from the shock which it had received that is worse than you  flora  but rather would i have you cherish hope of soon beholding charles holland  probably alive and well  than fancy any great disaster has come over him i will endeavour to do so  replied flora i long to hear what has become of dr  chillingworth  his disappearance is most singular  for i fully suspected that he had some particular object in view in getting possession for a short time of bannerworth hall  but now  from jack pringle s account  he appears not to be in it and  in fact  to have disappeared completely from the sight of all who knew him yes  said flora  but he may have done that  brother  still in furtherance of his object it may be so  and i will hope that it is so  keep yourself close sister  and see no one  while i proceed to his house to inquire if they have heard anything of him  i will return soon  be assured  and  in the meantime  should you see my brother  tell him i shall be at home in an hour or so  and not to leave the cottage  for it is more than likely that the admiral has gone to bannerworth hall  so that you may not see anything of him for some time chapter lxviii marchdale s attempted villany  and the result illustration varney the vampyre left the dungeon of charles holland amid the grey ruins  with a perfect confidence the young man would keep his word  and not attempt to escape from that place until the time had elapsed which he had dictated to him and well might he have that confidence  for having once given his word that he would remain until he heard the clock strike two from a neighbouring church  charles holland never dreamt for a moment of breaking it to be sure it was a weary time to wait when liberty appeared before him but he was the soul of honour  and the least likely man in all the world to infringe in the slightest upon the condition which he had  of his own free will  acceded to sir francis varney walked rapidly until he came nearly to the outskirts of the town  and then he slackened his pace  proceeding more cautiously and looking carefully about him  as if he feared to meet any one who might recognise him he had not proceeded far in this manner  when he became conscious of the cautious figure of a man gliding along in the opposite direction to that which he was taking a suspicion struck him  from the general appearance  that it was marchdale  and if so he wondered to see him abroad at such a time  still he would not be quite certain  but he hurried forward  so as to meet the advancing figure  and then his suspicions were confirmed  and marchdale with some confusion in his looks and manners  accosted him ah  sir francis varney  he said  you are out late why  you know i should be out late  said varney  and you likewise know the errand upon which i was to be out oh  i recollect  you were to release your prisoner yes  i was and have you done so oh  no oh  indeed  i i am glad you have taken better thoughts of it  good night good night  we shall meet to morrow adieu  said sir francis varney  and he watched the retreating figure of marchdale  and then he added  in a low tone to himself i know his object well  his craven spirit shrinks at the notion  a probable enough one  i will admit  that charles holland has recognised him  and that  if once free  he would denounce him to the bannerworths holding him up to scorn in his true colours  and bringing down upon his head  perhaps  something more than detestation and contempt  the villain  he is going now to take the life of the man whom he considers chained to the ground  well  well  they must fight it out together charles holland is sufficiently free to take his own part  although marchdale little thinks that such is the case marchdale walked on for some little distance  and then he turned and looked after sir francis varney indeed  he said  so you have not released him to night  but i know well will do so soon  i do not  for my part  admire this romantic generosity which sets a fox free at the moment that he s the most dangerous  it s all very well to be generous  but it is better to be just first  and that i consider means looking after one s self first  i have a poniard here which will soon put an end to the troubles of the prisoner in his dungeon its edge is keen and sharp  and will readily find a way to his heart he walked on quite exultingly and carelessly now  for he had got into the open country  and it was extremely unlikely that he would meet anybody on his road to the ruins it did not take many minutes  sharp walking now to bring him close to the spot which he intended should become such a scene of treacherous slaughter  and just then he heard from afar off something like the muttering of thunder  as if heaven itself was proclaiming its vengeance against the man who had come out to slay one of its best and noblest creatures what is that  said marchdale  shrinking back a moment  what is that an approaching storm  it must be so  for  now i recollect me  the sun set behind a bank of clouds of a fiery redness  and as the evening drew in there was every appearance in the heavens of some ensuing strife of the elements he listened for a few moments  and fixed his eyes intently in the direction of the horizon from where the muttering sounds had proceeded he had not long to wait before he saw a bright flash of blue lightning which for one instant illumined the sky  then by the time he could have counted twelve there came the thunder which the flash preceded  and he felt terribly anxious to complete his enterprize  so that he might get back to the town and be safely housed before the storm  which was evidently approaching  should burst upon him it is sweeping on apace  he said  why did i not come earlier even as he spoke he plunged among the recesses of the ruins  and searching about for the old stone which covered the entrance to the dungeon  he was surprised to find it rolled from its place  and the aperture open what is the meaning of this  he said  how negligent of sir francis varney  or perhaps  after all  he was only jesting with me  and let the prisoner go  if that should be the case  i am foiled indeed  but surely he could not be so full of indiscretion again came a dazzling flash of lightning  which now  surrounded by the ruins as he was  made him shrink back and cover his eyes for a moment and then followed a peal of thunder with not half the duration of time between it and the flash which had characterized the previous electric phenomenon the storm approaches fast  said marchdale  i must get my work done quickly  if indeed my victim be here  which i begin seriously to doubt he descended the intricate winding passage to the vault below  which served the purpose of a dungeon  and when he got very nearly into the depth of its recesses  he called aloud  saying ho  what ho  is there any one here yes  said charles holland  who fancied it might be his former visitor returned  have you come to repent of your purpose ah  said marchdale to himself  sir francis  after all  has told me the truth the prisoner is still here the light from without was not near sufficient to send the least ray into the depths of that dungeon  so that marchdale  when he entered the place  could see nothing but an absolute blackness it was not so  however  with charles holland  whose eyes had been now so long accustomed to the place that he could see in it as if a dim twilight irradiated it  and he at once  in his visitor  saw his worst foe  and not the man who had comparatively set him free he saw  too  that the hand of his visitor grasped a weapon  which marchdale thought that  favoured by the darkness  he might carry openly in perfect security where are you  said marchdale  i cannot see you here  said charles  you may feel my grip  and he sprung upon him in an instant the attack was so sudden and so utterly unexpected  that marchdale was thrown backwards  and the dagger wrested from his grasp  during the first impulse which charles holland had thrown into his attack moreover  his head struck with such violence against the earthern floor that it produced a temporary confusion of his faculties  so that  had charles holland been so inclined  he might  with marchdale s own weapon have easily taken his life the young man did  on the impulse of the moment  raise it in his hand but  on the impulse of another thought  he cast it from him exclaiming no  no  not that  i should be as bad as he  or nearly so  this villain has come to murder me  but yet i will not take his life for the deed what shall i do with him  ha  a lucky thought chains he dragged marchdale to the identical spot of earth on which he had lain so long  and  as sir francis varney had left the key of the padlock which bound the chains together in it  he  in a few moments  had succeeded in placing the villain marchdale in the same durance from which he had himself shortly since escaped remain there  he said  until some one comes to rescue you  i will not let you starve to death  but i will give you a long fast  and  when i come again  it shall be along with some of the bannerworth family  to show them what a viper they have fostered in their hearts marchdale was just sufficiently conscious now to feel all the realities of his situation  in vain he attempted to rise from his prostrate position  the chains did their duty  keeping down a villain with the same means that they had held in ignominious confinement a true man he was in a perfect agony  inasmuch as he considered that he would be allowed to remain there to starve to death  thus achieving for himself a more horrible death than any he had ever thought of inflicting villain  exclaimed charles holland  you shall there remain  and  let you have what mental sufferings you may  you richly deserve them he heeded not the cries of marchdale he heeded not his imprecations any more than he did his prayers  and the arch hypocrite used both in abundance  charles was but too happy once more to look upon the open sky  although it was then in darkness  to heed anything that marchdale in the agony to which he was now reduced  might feel inclined to say and  after glancing around him for some few moments  when he was free of the ruins  and inhaling with exquisite delight the free air of the surrounding meadows  he saw  by the twinkling of the lights  in which direction the town lay  and knowing that by taking a line in that path and then after a time diverging a little to the right  he should come to bannerworth hall  he walked on  never in his whole life probably feeling such an enjoyment of the mere fact of existence as at such a moment as that of exquisite liberty our readers may with us imagine what it is to taste the free  fresh air of heaven  after being long pent up  as he  charles holland  had been in a damp  noisome dungeon  teeming with unwholesome exhalations  they may well suppose with what an amount of rapture he now found himself unrestrained in his movements by those galling fetters which had hung for so long a period upon his youthful limbs  and which  not unfrequently in the despair of his heart  he had thought he should surely die in and last  although not least in his dear esteem  did the rapturous thought of once more looking in the sweet face of her he loved come cross him with a gush of delight yes  he exclaimed  as he quickened his pace  yes  i shall be able to tell flora bannerworth how well and how truly i love her  i shall be able to tell her that  in my weary and hideous imprisonment  the thought alone of her has supported me as he neared the hall  he quickened his pace to such an extent  that soon he was forced to pause altogether  as the exertion he had undertaken pretty plainly told him that the imprisonment  scanty diet and want of exercise  which had been his portion for some time past  had most materially decreased his strength his limbs trembled  and a profuse perspiration bedewed his brow although the night was rather cold than otherwise i am very weak  he said  and much i wonder now that i succeeded in overcoming that villain marchdale  who  if i had not done so  would most assuredly have murdered me and it was a wonder  for marchdale was not an old man  although he might be considered certainly as past the prime of life  and he was of a strong and athletic build  but it was the suddenness of his attack upon him which had given charles holland the great advantage  and had caused the defeat of the ruffian who came bent on one of the most cowardly and dastardly murders that could be committed namely  upon an unoffending man  whom he supposed to be loaded with chains  and incapable of making the least efficient resistance charles soon again recovered sufficient breath and strength to proceed towards the hall  and now warned  by the exhaustion which had come over him that he had not really anything like strength enough to allow him to proceed rapidly  he walked with slow and deliberate steps this mode of proceeding was more favourable to reflection than the wild rapid one which he had at first adopted  and in all the glowing colours of youthful and ingenious fancy did he depict to himself the surprise and the pleasure that would beam in the countenance of his beloved flora when she should find him once again by her side of course  he  charles  could know nothing of the contrivances which had been resorted to  and which the reader may lay wholly to the charge of marchdale  to blacken his character  and to make him appear faithless to the love he had professed had he known this  it is probable that indignation would have added wings to his progress  and he would not have been able to proceed at the leisurely pace he felt that his state of physical weakness dictated to him and now he saw the topmost portion at bannerworth hall pushing out from amongst the trees with which the ancient pile was so much surrounded and the sight of the home of his beloved revived him  and quickened the circulation of the warm blood in his veins i shall behold her now  he said i shall behold her how  a few minutes more  and i shall hold her to my heart that heart which has been ever hers  and which carried her image enshrined in its deepest recesses  even into the gloom of a dungeon but let us  while charles holland is indulging in these delightful anticipations anticipations which  we regret  in consequence of the departure of the bannerworths from the hall  will not be realized so soon as he supposes look back upon the discomfited hypocrite and villain  marchdale  who occupies his place in the dungeon of the old ruins until charles holland actually had left the strange  horrible  and cell like place  he could scarcely make up his mind that the young man entertained a serious intention of leaving him there perhaps he did not think any one could be so cruel and so wicked as he himself  for the reader will no doubt recollect that his  marchdale s counsel to varney  was to leave charles holland to his fate  chained down as he was in the dungeon  and that fate would have been the horrible one of being starved to death in the course of a few days when now  however  he felt confident that he was deserted when he heard the sound of charles holland s retreating footsteps slowly dying away in the distance  until not the faintest echo of them reached his ears  he despaired indeed  and the horror he experienced during the succeeding ten minutes  might be considered an ample atonement for some of his crimes  his brain was in a complete whirl  nothing of a tangible nature but that he was there  chained down  and left to starve to death  came across his intellect  then a kind of madness  for a moment or two  took possession of him  he made a tremendous effort to burst asunder the bands that held him but it was in vain  the chains which had been placed upon charles holland during the first few days of his confinement  when he had a little recovered from the effects of the violence which had been committed upon him at the time when he was captured effectually resisted marchdale they even cut into his flesh  inflicting upon him some grievous wounds but that was all he achieved by his great efforts to free himself  so that  after a few moments  bleeding and in great pain  he  with a deep groan  desisted from the fruitless efforts he had better not have commenced then he remained silent for a time  but it was not the silence of reflection  it was that of exhaustion  and  as such  was not likely to last long  nor did it  for  in the course of another five minutes  he called out loudly perhaps he thought there might be a remote chance that some one traversing the meadows would hear him  and yet  if he had duly considered the matter  which he was not in a fitting frame of mind to do  he would have recollected that  in choosing a dungeon among the underground vaults of these ruins  he had  by experiment  made certain that no cry  however loud  from where he lay  could reach the upper air and thus had this villain  by the very precautions which he had himself taken to ensure the safe custody of another  been his own greatest enemy help  help  help  he cried frantically varney  charles holland  have mercy upon me  and do not leave me here to starve  help  oh  heaven curses on all your heads curses  oh  mercy mercy mercy in suchlike incoherent expressions did he pass some hours  until  what with exhaustion and a raging thirst that came over him  he could not utter another word  but lay the very picture of despair and discomfited malice and wickedness chapter lxix flora bannerworth and her mother the episode of chivalry illustration gladly we turn from such a man as marchdale to a consideration of the beautiful and accomplished flora bannerworth  to whom we may  without destroying in any way the interest of our plot  predict a much happier destiny than  probably  at that time  she considers as at all likely to be hers she certainly enjoyed  upon her first removal from bannerworth hall greater serenity of mind than she had done there  but  as we have already remarked of her  the more her mind was withdrawn  by change of scene  from the horrible considerations which the attack of the vampyre had forced upon her  the more she reverted to the fate of charles holland  which was still shrouded in so much gloom she would sit and converse with her mother upon that subject until she worked up her feelings to a most uncomfortable pitch of excitement  and then mrs  bannerworth would get her younger brother to join them  who would occasionally read to her some compositions of his own  or of some favourite writer whom he thought would amuse her illustration it was on the very evening when sir francis varney had made up his mind to release charles holland  that young bannerworth read to his sister and his mother the following little chivalric incident  which he told them he had himself collated from authentic sources the knight with the green shield  exclaimed one of a party of men at arms  who were drinking together at an ancient hostel  not far from shrewsbury the knight with the green shield is as good a knight as ever buckled on a sword  or wore spurs then how comes it he is not one of the victors in the day s tournament  exclaimed another by the bones of alfred  said a third  a man must be judged of by his deserts  and not by the partiality of his friends  that s my opinion friends and mine  too  said another that is all very true  and my opinion would go with yours  too  but not in this instance  though you may accuse me of partiality  yet i am not so  for i have seen some of the victors of to day by no means forward in the press of battle men who  i will not say feared danger  but who liked it not so well but they avoided it as much as possible ay  marry  and so have i  the reason is  tis much easier to face a blunted lance  than one with a spear head  and a man may practise the one and thrive in it  but not the other  for the best lance in the tournament is not always the best arm in the battle and that is the reason of my saying the knight with the green shield was a good knight  i have seen him in the midst of the melee  when men and horses have been hurled to the ground by the shock  there he has behaved himself like a brave knight  and has more than once been noticed for it but how canne he to be so easily overthrown to day  that speaks something his horse is an old one so much the better  said another  he s used to his work  and as cunning as an old man but he has been wounded more than once  and is weakened very much  besides  i saw him lose his footing  else he had overthrown his opponent he did not seem distressed about his accident  at all events  but sat contented in the tent he knows well that those who know him will never attribute his misadventure either to want of courage or conduct moreover  he seems to be one of those who care but little for the opinion of men who care nothing for him and he s right  well  dear comrades  the health of green knight  or the knight with a green shield  for that s his name  or the designation he chooses to go by a health to the knight with the green shield shouted the men at arms  as they lifted their cups on high who is he  inquired one of the men at arms  of him who had spoken favourably of the stranger i don t know and yet you spoke favourably of him a few seconds back  and said what a brave knight he was and so i uphold him to be  but  i tell you what friend  i would do as much for the greatest stranger i ever met  i have seen him fight where men and horses have bit the dust in hundreds  and that  in my opinion  speaks out for the man and warrior  he who cannot then  fight like a soldier  had better tilt at home in the castle yard and there win ladies  smiles  but not the commendation of the leader of the battle that s true  i myself recollect very well sir hugh de colbert  a very accomplished knight in the castle yard  but his men were as fine a set of fellows as ever crossed a horse  to look at  but they proved deficient at the moment of trial  they were broken  and fled in a moment  and scarce one of them received a scratch then they hadn t stood the shock of the foeman no  that s certain but still i should like to know the knight to know his name very well i know it not  he has some reason for keeping it secret  i suppose  but his deeds will not shame it  be it what it may  i can bear witness to more than one foeman falling beneath his battle axe indeed yes  and he took a banner from the enemy in the last battle that was fought ah  well  he deserves a better fortune to morrow  who is to be the bridegroom of the beautiful bertha  daughter of lord de cauci that will have to be decided  but it is presumed that sir guthrie de beaumont is the intended ah  but should he not prove the victor it s understood  because it s known he is intended by the parents of the lady  and none would be ungallant enough to prevail against him save on such conditions as would not endanger the fruits of victory no certainly not  they would lay the trophies at the foot of the beauty worshipped by the knights at the tournament so  triumphant or not  he s to be the bridegroom  bearing off the prize of valour whether or no in fact  deserve her or not that s the fact so it is  so it is and a shame  too  friends  but so it is now  but yet  if the knight s horse recovers from the strain  and is fit for work to morrow  it strikes me that the green shield will give some work to the holiday knight                                    there had been a grand tournament held near shrewsbury castle  in honour of the intended nuptials of the beautiful lady bertha de cauci  she was the only daughter of the earl de cauci  a nobleman of some note  he was one of an ancient and unblemished name  and of great riches the lady was beautiful  but  at the same time  she was an unwilling bride every one could see that  but the bridegroom cared not for that there was a sealed sorrow on her brow a sorrow that seemed sincere and lasting  but she spoke not of it to any one her lips were seldom parted  she loved another  yes  she loved one who was far away  fighting in the wars of his country one who was not so rich in lands as her present bridegroom when he left her  she remembered his promise  it was  to fight on till he earned a fortune  or name that should give him some right to claim her hand  even from her imperious father  but alas  he came not  and what could she do against the commands of one who would be obeyed  her mother  too  was a proud  haughty woman  one whose sole anxiety was to increase the grandeur and power of her house by such connections thus it was pressed on by circumstances  she could no longer hold out more especially as she heard nothing of her knight  she knew not where he was  or indeed if he were living or dead  she knew not he was never named  this last circumstance  indeed  gave her pain  for it assured her that he whom she loved had been unable to signalize himself from among other men  that  in fact  he was unknown in the annals of fame  as well as the probability that he had been slain in some of the earlier skirmishes of the war  this  if it had happened  caused her some pain to think upon  not but such events were looked upon with almost indifference by females  save in such cases where their affections were engaged  as on this occasion  but the event was softened by the fact that men were continually falling by the hand of man in such encounters but at the same time it was considered an honourable and praiseworthy death for a soldier  he was wounded  but not with the anguish we now hear of  for the friends were consoled by the reflection that the deceased warrior died covered with glory bertha  however  was young  and as yet she knew not the cause of her absent knight s silence  or why he had not been heard of among the most forward in the battle heaven s will be done  she exclaimed  what can i do  i must submit to my father s behests  but my future life will be one of misery and sorrow she wept to think of the past  and to dream of the future  both alike were sorrowful to think upon no comfort in the past and no joy in the future thus she wept and sorrowed on the night of the first tournament  there was to be a second  and that was to be the grand one  where her intended bridegroom was to show himself off in her eyes  and take his part in the sport                                    bertha sat late she sat sorrowing by the light of the lamps and the flickering flame of the fire  as it rose and fell on the hearth and threw dancing shadows on the walls oh  why  arthur home  should you thus be absent  absent  too  at such a time when you are more needed than ever  alas  alas  you may no longer be in the land of the living  your family is great and your name known your own has been spoken with commendation from the lips of your friend  what more of fame do you need  but i am speaking without purpose  heaven have mercy on me as she spoke she looked up and saw one of her women in waiting standing by well  what would you my lady  there is one who would speak with you  said the hand maiden with me yes  my lady  he named you the lady bertha de cauci who and what is he  she inquired  with something like trepidation  of the maiden i know not  my lady but gave he not some token by which i might know who i admit to my chamber none  replied the maiden and what does he bear by way of distinguishing himself  what crest or device doth he bear merely a green shield the unsuccessful knight in the tournament to day  heaven s  what can he desire with me  he is not no  no  it cannot be it cannot be will you admit him  lady indeed  i know not what to do  but yet he may have some intelligence to give me  yes  yes  admit him  but first throw some logs on the fire the attendant did as she was desired  and then quitted the room for the purpose of admitting the stranger knight with the green shield  in a few moments she could hear the stride of the knight as he entered the apartment  and she thought the step was familiar to her ear she thought it was the step of sir arthur home  her lover  she waited anxiously to see the door open  and then the stranger entered  his form and bearing was that of her lover  but his visor was down  and she was unable to distinguish the features of the stranger his armour was such as had seen many a day s hard wear  and there were plenty of marks of the battle about him  his travel worn accoutrements were altogether such as bespoke service in the field sir  you desired to see me  say wherefore you do so  and if it is news you bring  the knight answered not  but pointed to the female attendant  as if he desired she would withdraw  you may retire  said bertha  be within call  and let me know if i am threatened with interruption the attendant retired  and then the knight and lady were left alone  the former seemed at a loss how to break silence for some moments  and then he said lady  oh  heavens  tis he  exclaimed bertha  as she sprang to her feet  it is sir arthur home it is  exclaimed the knight  pulling up his visor  and dropping on one knee he encircled his arm round the waist of the lady  and at the same moment he pressed her lips to his own the first emotion of joy and surprise over  bertha checked her transports  and chid the knight for his boldness nay  chide me not  dear bertha  i am what i was when i left you  and hope to find you the same am i not  said bertha truly i know not  for you seem more beautiful than you were then  i hope that is the only change if there be a change  it is only such as you see  sorrow and regret form the principal causes i understand you my intended nuptials  yes  i have heard all  i came here but late in the morning  and my horse was jaded and tired  and my impatience to attend the tournament caused me a disaster which it is well it came not on the second day it is  dear arthur  how is it i never heard your name mentioned  or that i received no news from any one about you during the wars that have ended i had more than one personal enemy  bertha  men who would have been glad to see me fall  and who  in default of that  would not have minded bribing an assassin to secure my death for them at any risk whatever heavens  and how did you escape such a death from such people arthur by adopting such a device as that i wear  the knight of the green shield i m called i saw you to day in the tournament and there my tired and jaded horse gave way  but to morrow i shall have  i hope  a different fortune i hope so too i will try  my arm has been good in battle  and i see not why it should be deficient in peaceful jousts certainly not  what fortune have you met with since you left england i was of course known but to a few  among those few were the general under whom i served and my more immediate officers  who i knew would not divulge my secret and they did not no  kept it nobly  and kept their eyes upon me in battle  and i have reaped a rich harvest in force  honour  and riches  i assure you thank heaven  said bertha bertha  if i be conqueror  may i claim you in the court yard before all the spectators you may  said bertha  and she hung her head moreover  said sir arthur  you will not make a half promise  but when i demand you  you will at once come down to me and accept me as your husband  if i be the victor then he cannot object to the match but he will have many friends  and his intended bride will have many more  so that you may run some danger among so many enemies never fear for me  bertha  because i shall have many friends of distinction there too many old friends who are tried men in battle  and whose deeds are a glory and honour to them  besides  i shall have my commander and several gentlemen who would at once interfere in case any unfair advantage was attempted to be taken of my supposed weakness have you a fresh horse  inquired bertha i have  or shall have by the morning  but promise me you will do what i ask you  and then my arm will be nerved to its utmost  and i am sure to be victorious i do promise  said bertha  i hope you may be as successful as you hope to be  arthur  but suppose fortune should declare against you suppose an accident of any kind were to happen  what could be done then i must be content to hide myself for ever afterwards  as a defeated knight  how can i appear before your friends as the claimant of your hand i will never have any other but you will be forced to accept this guthrie de beaumont  your father s chosen son in law i will seek refuge in a cloister will you fly with me  bertha  to some sequestered spot  where we can live in each others society yes  said bertha  anything  save marriage with guthrie de beaumont then await the tournament of to morrow  said sir arthur and then this may be avoided  in the meantime  keep up a good heart and remember i am at hand                                    these two lovers parted for the present  after a protracted interview bertha to her chamber  and the knight of the green shield to his tent the following morning was one of great preparation  the lists had been enlarged  and the seats made more commodious  for the influx of visitors appeared to be much greater than had been anticipated moreover  there were many old warriors of distinction to be present which made the bridegroom look pale and feel uncomfortable as to the results of the tournament  the tilting was to begin at an early hour and then the feasting and revelry would begin early in the evening after the tilting had all passed off in that day s work there were many thrown from their saddles  and many broke their lances  the bridegroom tilted with several knights  and came off victorious  or without disadvantage to either the green knight  on the contrary  tilted with but few  and always victorious  and such matches were with men who had been men of some name in the wars  or at least in the tilt yard the sports drew to a close  and when the bridegroom became the challenger  the knight of the green shield at once rode out quietly to meet him  the encounter could not well be avoided  and the bridegroom would willingly have declined the joust with a knight who had disposed of his enemies so easily  and so unceremoniously as he had the first encounter was enough  the bridegroom was thrown to a great distance  and lay insensible on the ground  and was carried out of the field  there was an immediate sensation among the friends of the bridegroom  several of whom rode out to challenge the stranger knight for his presumption in this  however  they had misreckoned the chances  for the challenged accepted their challenges with alacrity and disposed of them one by one with credit to himself until the day was concluded  the stranger was then asked to declare who he was  upon which he lifted his visor  and said i am sir arthur home  and claim the lady bertha as my bride  by the laws of arms  and by those of love                                    again the tent was felled  and again the hostelry was tenanted by the soldier  who declared for one side and then for the other  as the cups clanged and jingled together said i not  exclaimed one of the troopers  that the knight with a green shield was a good knight you did  replied the other and you knew who he was  said another of the troopers not i comrades  i had seen him fight in battle  and  therefore  partly guessed how it would be if he had any chance with the bridegroom  i m glad he has won the lady it was true  the lady bertha was won  and sir arthur home claimed his bride  and then they attempted to defeat his claim  yet bertha at once expressed herself in his favour  to strongly that they were  however reluctantly compelled  to consent at last at this moment  a loud shout as from a multitude of persons came upon their ears and flora started from her seat in alarm  the cause of the alarm we shall proceed to detail chapter lxx the funeral of the stranger of the inn the popular commotion  and mrs chillingworth s appeal to the mob the new riot the hall in danger illustration as yet the town was quiet  and  though there was no appearance of riot or disturbance  yet the magistracy had taken every precaution they deemed needful  or their position and necessities warranted  to secure the peace of the town from the like disturbance to that which had been of late  a disgrace and terror of peaceably disposed persons the populace were well advertised of the fact  that the body of the stranger was to be buried that morning in their churchyard  and that  to protect the body  should there be any necessity for so doing  a large body of constables would be employed there was no disposition to riot  at least  none was visible  it looked as if there was some event about to take place that was highly interesting to all parties  who were peaceably assembling to witness the interment of nobody knew who the early hour at which persons were assembling  at different points clearly indicated that there was a spirit of curiosity about the town so uncommon that none would have noticed it but for the fact of the crowd of people who hung about the streets  and there remained  listless and impatient the inn  too  was crowded with visitors  and there were many who  not being blessed with the strength of purse that some were  were hanging about in the distance  waiting and watching the motions of those who were better provided ah  said one of the visitors  this is a disagreeable job in your house  landlord yes  sir  i d sooner it had happened elsewhere  i assure you  i know it has done me no good no  no man could expect any  and yet it is none the less unfortunate for that i would sooner anything else happen than that  whatever it might be  i think it must be something very bad  at all events  but i dare say i shall never see the like again so much the better for the town  said another  for  what with vampyres and riots  there has been but little else stirring than mischief and disturbances of one kind and another yes  and  what between varneys and bannerworths  we have had but little peace here precisely  do you know it s my opinion that the least thing would upset the whole town  any one unlucky word would do it  i am sure  said a tall thin man i have no doubt of it  said another  but i hope the military would do their duty under such circumstances  for people s lives and property are not safe in such a state of things oh  dear no i wonder what has become of varney  or where he can have gone to some thought he must have been burned when they burned his house  replied the landlord but i believe it generally understood he s escaped  has he not  no traces of his body were found in the ruins none  oh  he s escaped there can be no doubt of that  i wish i had some fortune depending upon the fact  it would be mine  i am sure well  the lord keep us from vampyres and suchlike cattle  said an old woman  i shall never sleep again in my bed with any safety  it frightens one out of one s life to think of it  what a shame the men didn t catch him and stake him the old woman left the inn as soon as she had spoke this christian speech humane  said a gentleman  with a sporting coat on  the old woman is no advocate for half measures you are right  sir  said the landlord  and a very good look out she keeps upon the pot  to see it s full  and carefully blows the froth off ah  i thought as much how soon will the funeral take place  landlord  inquired a person  who had at that moment entered the inn in about an hour s time  sir oh  the town seems pretty full  though it is very quiet  i suppose it is more as a matter of curiosity people congregate to see the funeral of this stranger i hope so  sir the time is wearing on  and if they don t make a dust  why then the military will not be troubled i do not expect anything more  sir  said the landlord  for you see they must have had their swing out  as the saying is  and be fully satisfied  they cannot have much more to do in the way of exhibiting their anger or dislike to vampyres they all have done enough so they have so they have granted  said an old man with a troublesome cough  but when did you ever know a mob to be satisfied  if they wanted the moon and got it they d find out it would be necessary to have the stars also that s uncommonly true  said the landlord  i shouldn t be surprised if they didn t do something worse than ever nothing more likely said the little old man  i can believe anything of a mob anything no matter what the inn was crowded with visitors  and several extra hands were employed to wait upon the customers  and a scene of bustle and activity was displayed that was never before seen  it would glad the heart of a landlord  though he were made of stone  and landlords are usually of much more malleable materials than that however  the landlord had hardly time to congratulate himself  for the bearers were come now  and the undertaker and his troop of death following officials there was a stir among the people  who began now to awaken from the lethargy that seemed to have come over them while they were waiting for the moment when it should arrive  that was to place the body under the green sod  against which so much of their anger had been raised  there was a decent silence that pervaded the mob of individuals who had assembled death  with all its ghastly insignia  had an effect even upon the unthinking multitude  who were ever ready to inflict death or any violent injury upon any object that came in their way they never hesitated  but even these  now the object of their hatred was no more felt appalled tis strange what a change comes over masses of men as they gaze upon a dead body  it may be that they all know that to that complexion they must come at last  this may be the secret of the respect offered to the dead the undertakers are men  however  who are used to the presence of death it is their element  they gain a living by attending upon the last obsequies of the dead  they are used to dead bodies  and care not for them  some of them are humane men  that is  in their way  and even among them are men who wouldn t be deprived of the joke as they screwed down the last screw  they could not forbear  even on this occasion  to hold their converse when left alone jacobs  said one who was turning a long screw  jacobs  my boy  do you take the chair to night yes  said jacobs who was a long lugubrious looking man  i do take the chair  if i live over this blessed event you are not croaking  jacobs  are you  well  you are a lively customer you are lively do you expect people to be lively when they are full dressed for a funeral  you are a nice article for your profession  you don t feel like an undertaker  you don t don t  jacobs  my boy  as long as i look like one when occasion demands  when i have done my job i puts my comfort in my pocket  and thinks how much more pleasanter it is to be going to other people s funerals than to our own  and then only see the difference as regards the money true  said jacobs with a groan  but death s a melancholy article  at all events so it is and then when you come to consider the number of people we have buried how many have gone to their last homes and how many more will go the same way yes  yes  that s all very well  jacob  you are precious surly this morning  i ll come to night  you re brewing a sentimental tale as sure as eggs is eggs well  that is pretty certain  but as i was saying how many more are there ah  don t bother yourself with calculations that have neither beginning nor end  and which haven t one point to go  come  jacob  have you finished yet quite  said jacob they now arranged the pall  and placed all in readiness  and returned to a place down stairs where they could enjoy themselves for an odd half hour  and pass that time away until the moment should arrive when his reverence would be ready to bury the deceased  upon consideration of the fees to be paid upon the occasion the tap room was crowded  and there was no room for the men  and they were taken into the kitchen  where they were seated  and earnestly at work  preparing for the ceremony that had so shortly to be performed any better  jacobs what do you mean  inquired jacobs  with a groan  it s news to me if i have been ill oh  yes  you were doleful up stairs  you know i ve a proper regard for my profession that s the difference between you and i  you know i ll wager you what you like  now  that i ll handle a corpse and drive a screw in a coffin as well as you  now  although you are so solid and miserable so you may so you may then what do you mean by saying i haven t a proper regard for my profession i say you haven t  and there s the thing that shall prove it you don t look it  and that s the truth i don t look like an undertaker  indeed i dare say i don t if i ain t dressed like one nor when you are  reiterated jacob why not  pray because you have always a grin on your face as broad as a gridiron that s why this ended the dispute  for the employer of the men suddenly put his head in  saying come  now  time s up  you are wanted up stairs  all of you  be quick we shall have his reverence waiting for us  and then we shall lose his recommendation ready sir  said the round man  taking up his pint and finishing it off at a draught  at the same moment he thrust the remains of some bread and cheese into his pocket jacob  too  took his pot  and  having finished it  with great gravity followed the example of his more jocose companion  and they all left the kitchen for the room above  where the corpse was lying ready for interment there was an unusual bustle  everybody was on the tip top of expectation  and awaiting the result in a quiet hurry  and hoped to have the first glimpse of the coffin  though why they should do so it was difficult to define  but in this fit of mysterious hope and expectation they certainly stood will they be long  inquired a man at the door of one inside will they be long before they come they are coming now  said the man do you all keep quiet  they are knocking their heads against the top of the landing  hark  there  i told you so the man departed  hearing something  and being satisfied that he had got some information now  then  said the landlord  move out of the way  and allow the corpse to pass out  let me have no indecent conduct  let everything be as it should be the people soon removed from the passage and vicinity of the doorway and then the mournful procession as the newspapers have it moved forward  they were heard coming down stairs  and thence along the passage  until they came to the street  and then the whole number of attendants was plainly discernible how different was the funeral of one who had friends  he was alone  none followed  save the undertaker and his attendants  all of whom looked solemn from habit and professional motives  even the jocose man was as supernaturally solemn as could be well imagined  indeed  nobody knew he was the same man well  said the landlord  as he watched them down the street  as they slowly paced their way with funereal  not sorrowful  solemnity well  i am very glad that it is all over it has been a sad plague to you  said one it has  indeed  it must be to any one who has had another such a job as this  i don t say it out of any disrespect to the poor man who is dead and gone quite the reverse  but i would not have such another affair on my hands for pounds i can easily believe you  especially when we come to consider the disagreeables of a mob you may say that  there s no knowing what they will or won t do confound them  if they d act like men  and pay for what they have  why then i shouldn t care much about them  but it don t do to have other people in the bar i should think not  indeed  that would alter the scale of your profits i reckon it would make all the difference to me  business  added the landlord conducted on that scale  would become a loss  and a man might as well walk into a well at once so i should say  have many such occurrences as these been usual in this part of the country  inquired the stranger not usual at all  said the landlord  but the fact is  the whole neighbourhood has run distracted about some superhuman being they call a vampyre indeed yes  and they suspected the unfortunate man who has been lying up stairs  a corpse  for some days oh  the man they have just taken in the coffin to bury  said the stranger yes  sir  the same well  i thought perhaps somebody of great consequence had suddenly become defunct oh  dear no  it would not have caused half the sensation  people have been really mad it was a strange occurrence  altogether  i believe  was it  inquired the stranger indeed it was  sir  i hardly know the particulars  there have been so many tales afloat  though they all concur in one point  and that is  it has destroyed the peace of one family who has done so the vampyre indeed  i never heard of such an animal  save as a fable  before  it seems to me extraordinary so it would do to any one  sir  as was not on the spot  to see it  i m sure i wouldn t                                    in the meantime  the procession  short as it was of itself  moved along in slow time through a throng of people who ran out of their houses on either side of the way  and lined the whole length of the town many of these closed in behind  and followed the mourners until they were near the church  and then they made a rush to get into the churchyard as yet all had been conducted with tolerable propriety  the funeral met with no impediment  the presence of death among so many of them seemed some check upon the licence of the mob  who bowed in silence to the majesty of death who could bear ill will against him who was now no more  man  while he is man  is always the subject of hatred  fear  or love  some one of these passions  in a modified state  exists in all men  and with such feelings they will regard each other  and it is barely possible that any one should not be the object of some of these  and hence the stranger s corpse was treated with respect in silence the body proceeded along the highway until it came to the churchyard  and followed by an immense multitude of people of all grades the authorities trembled  they knew not what all this portended  they thought it might pass off  but it might become a storm first  they hoped and feared by turns  till some of them fell sick with apprehension there was a deep silence observed by all those in the immediate vicinity of the coffin  but those farther in the rear found full expression for their feelings do you think  said an old man to another  that he will come to life again  eh oh  yes  vampyres always do  and lay in the moonlight  and then they come to life again  moonlight recovers a vampyre to life again and yet the moonlight is cold ah  but who s to tell what may happen to a vampyre  or what s hot or what s cold certainly not  oh  dear  no and then they have permission to suck the blood of other people  to live themselves  and to make other people vampyres  too the lord have mercy upon us ay  but they have driven a stake through this one  and he can t get in moonlight or daylight  it s all over he s certainly done for  we may congratulate ourselves on this point so we may so we may they now neared the grave  the clergyman officiating as usual on such occasions  there was a large mob of persons on all sides  with serious faces  watching the progress of the ceremony  and who listened in quietness there was no sign of any disturbance amongst the people  and the authorities were well pleased  they congratulated themselves upon the quietness and orderliness of the assemblage the service was ended and the coffin lowered  and the earth was thrown on the coffin lid with a hollow sound  nobody could hear that sound unmoved  but in a short while the sound ceased as the grave became filled  it was then trodden carefully down there were no relatives there to feel affected at the last scene of all they were far away  and  according to popular belief upon the subject they must have been dead some ages                                    the mob watched the last shovel full of earth thrown upon the coffin and witnessed the ramming down of the soil  and the heaping of it over at top to make the usual monument  for all this was done speedily and carefully  lest there should be any tendency to exhume the body of the deceased the people were now somewhat relieved  as to their state of solemnity and silence  they would all of them converse freely on the matter that had so long occupied their thoughts they seemed now let loose  and everybody found himself at liberty to say or do something  no matter if it were not very reasonable  that is not always required of human beings who have souls  or  at least it is unexpected  and were it expected  the expectation would never be realized the day was likely to wear away without a riot  nay  even without a fight  a most extraordinary occurrence for such a place under the existing circumstances  for of late the populace  or  perhaps  the townspeople  were extremely pugnacious  and many were the disputes that were settled by the very satisfactory application of the knuckles to the head of the party holding a contrary opinion thus it was they were ready to take fire  and a hubbub would be the result of the slightest provocation  but  on the present occasion  there was a remarkable dearth of  all subjects of the nature described who was to lead israel out to battle  alas  no one on the present occasion such a one  however  appeared  at least  one who furnished a ready excuse for a disturbance suddenly  mrs chillingworth appeared in the midst of a large concourse of people  she had just left her house  which was close at hand  her eyes red with weeping  and her children around her on this occasion the crowd made way for her  and gathered round her to see what was going to happen friends and neighbours  she said can any of you relieve the tears of a distressed wife and mother  have any of you seen anything of my husband  mr  chillingworth what the doctor  exclaimed one yes  mr  chillingworth  the surgeon he has not been home two days and a night  i m distracted what can have become of him i don t know  unless here mrs chillingworth paused  and some person said unless what  mrs chillingworth  there are none but friends here  who wish the doctor well  and would do anything to serve him unless what speak out unless he s been destroyed by the vampyre  heaven knows what we may all come to  here am i and my children deprived of our protector by some means which we cannot imagine  he never  in all his life  did the same before he must have been spirited away by some of the vampyres  i ll tell you what  friend  said one to another  that something must be done nobody s safe in their bed no  they are not  indeed  i think that all vampyres ought to be burned and a stake run through them  and then we should be safe ay  but you must destroy all those who are even suspected of being vampyres  or else one may do all the mischief so he might hurrah  shouted the mob  chillingworth for ever  we ll find the doctor somewhere  if we pull down the whole town there was an immense commotion among the populace  who began to start throwing stones  and do all sorts of things without any particular object  and some  as they said  to find the doctor  or to show how willing they were to do so if they knew how mrs  chillingworth  however  kept on talking to the mob  who continued shouting  and the authorities anticipated an immediate outbreak of popular opinion  which is generally accompanied by some forcible demonstration  and on this occasion some one suggested the propriety of burning down bannerworth hall  because they had burned down the vampyre s home  and they might as well burn down that of the injured party  which was carried by acclamation  and with loud shouts they started on their errand this was a mob s proceeding all over  and we regret very much to say that it is very much the characteristic of english mobs  what an uncommonly strange thing it is that people in multitudes seem completely to get rid of all reason all honour all common ordinary honesty while  if you were to take the same people singly  you would find that they were reasonable enough  and would shrink with a feeling quite approaching to horror from anything in the shape of very flagrant injustice this can only be accounted for by a piece of cowardice in the human race  which induces them when alone  and acting with the full responsibility of their actions  to shrink from what it is quite evident they have a full inclination to do  and will do when  having partially lost their individuality in a crowd  they fancy  that to a certain extent they can do so with impunity the burning of sir francis varney s house  although it was one of those proceedings which would not bear the test of patient examination  was yet  when we take all the circumstances into consideration  an act really justifiable and natural in comparison with the one which was now meditated bannerworth hall had never been the residence even of anyone who had done the people any injury or given them any offence  so that to let it become a prey to the flames was but a gratuitous act of mischief it was  however  or seemed to be  doomed  for all who have had any experience in mobs  must know how extremely difficult it is to withdraw them from any impulse once given  especially when that impulse  as in the present instance  is of a violent character down with bannerworth hall  was the cry  burn it burn it  and augmented by fresh numbers each minute  the ignorant  and  in many respects  ruffianly assemblage  soon arrived within sight of what had been for so many years the bane of the bannerworths  and whatever may have been the fault of some of that race  those faults had been of a domestic character  and not at all such as would interfere with the public weal the astonished  and almost worn out authorities  hastily  now  after having disposed of their prisoners  collected together what troops they could  and by the time the misguided  or rather the not guided at all populace  had got halfway to bannerworth hall  they were being outflanked by some of the dragoons  who  by taking a more direct route hoped to reach bannerworth hall first  and so perhaps  by letting the mob see that it was defended  induce them to give up the idea of its destruction on account of the danger attendant upon the proceeding by far exceeding any of the anticipated delight of the disturbance illustration chapter lxxi the strange meeting at the hall between mr  chillingworth and the mysterious friend of varney illustration when we praise our friend mr  chillingworth for not telling his wife where he was going  in pursuance of a caution and a discrimination so highly creditable to him  we are quite certain that he has no such excuse as regards the reader  therefore we say at once that he had his own reasons now for taking up his abode at bannerworth hall for a time these reasons seemed to be all dependant upon the fact of having met the mysterious man at sir francis varney s  and although we perhaps would have hoped that the doctor might have communicated to henry bannerworth all that he knew and all that he surmised  yet have we no doubt that what he keeps to himself he has good reasons for so keeping  and that his actions as regards it are founded upon some very just conclusions he has then made a determination to take possession of  and remain in bannerworth hall according to the full and free leave which the admiral had given him so to do  what results he anticipated from so lonely and so secret a watch we cannot say  but probably they will soon exhibit themselves  it needed no sort of extraordinary discrimination for any one to feel it once that not the least good  in the way of an ambuscade was likely to be effected by such persons as admiral bell or jack pringle  they were all very well when fighting should actually ensue but they both were certainly remarkably and completely deficient in diplomatic skill  or in that sort of patience which should enable them at all to compete with the cunning  the skill  and the nice discrimination of such a man as sir francis varney if anything were to be done in that way it was unquestionably to be done by some one alone  who  like the doctor  would  and could  remain profoundly quiet and await the issue of events  be they what they might and probably remain a spy and attempt no overt act which should be of a hostile character  this unquestionably was the mode  and perhaps we should not be going too far when we say it was the only mode which could be with anything like safety relied upon as one likely to lead really to a discovery of sir francis varney s motives in making such determined exertions to get possession of bannerworth hall that night was doomed to be a very eventful one  indeed  for on it had charles holland been  by a sort of wild impulsive generosity of sir francis varney  rescued from the miserable dungeon in which he had been confined  and on that night  too  he  whom we cannot otherwise describe than as the villain marchdale  had been  in consequence of the evil that he himself meditated  and the crime with which he was quite willing to stain his soul  been condemned to occupy charles s position on that night  too  had the infuriated mob determined upon the destruction of bannerworth hall  and on that night was mr  chillingworth waiting with what patience he could exert  at the hall  for whatever in the chapter of accidents might turn up of an advantageous character to that family in whose welfare and fortunes he felt so friendly and so deep an interest let us look  then  at the worthy doctor as he keeps his solitary watch he did not  as had been the case when the admiral shared the place with him in the hope of catching varney on that memorable occasion when he caught only his boot  sit in a room with a light and the means and appliances for making the night pass pleasantly away  but  on the contrary  he abandoned the house altogether  and took up a station in that summer house which has been before mentioned as the scene of a remarkable interview between flora bannerworth and varney the vampyre alone and in the dark  so that he could not be probably seen  he watched that one window of the chamber where the first appearance of the hideous vampyre had taken place  and which seemed ever since to be the special object of his attack by remaining from twilight  and getting accustomed to the gradually increasing darkness of the place  no doubt the doctor was able to see well enough without the aid of any artificial light whether any one was in the place besides himself night after night  he said  will i watch here until i have succeeded in unravelling this mystery  for that there is some fearful and undreamt of mystery at the bottom of all these proceedings i am well convinced when he made such a determination as this  dr  chillingworth was not at all a likely man to break it  so there  looking like a modern statue in the arbour  he sat with his eyes fixed upon the balcony and the window of what used to be called flora s room for some hours the doctor was a contemplative man  and therefore he did not so acutely feel the loneliness of his position as many persons would have done moreover  he was decidedly not of a superstitious turn of mind  although certainly we cannot deny an imagination to him  however  if he really had harboured some strange fears and terrors they would have been excusable  when we consider how many circumstances had combined to make it almost a matter of demonstration that sir francis varney was something more than mortal what quantities of subjects the doctor thought over during his vigil in that garden it is hard to say  but never in his whole life  probably had he such a glorious opportunity for the most undisturbed contemplation of subjects requiring deep thought to analyze  than as he had then  at least he felt that since his marriage he had never been so thoroughly quiet  and left so completely to himself it is to be hoped that he succeeded in settling any medical points of a knotty character that might be hovering in his brain  and certain it is that he had become quite absorbed in an abstruse matter connected with physiology  when his ears were startled  and he was at once aroused to a full consciousness of where he was  and why he had come there  by the distant sound of a man s footstep it was a footstep which seemed to be that of a person who scarcely thought it at all necessary to use any caution  and the doctor s heart leaped within him as in the lowest possible whisper he said to himself i am successful i am successful  it is believed now that the hall is deserted  and no doubt that is sir francis varney come with confidence to carry out his object in so sedulously attacking it  be that object what it may elated with this idea  the doctor listened intently to the advancing footstep  which each moment sounded more clearly upon his ears it was evidently approaching from the garden entrance towards the house and he thought  by the occasional deadened sound of the person s feet be he whom he might  that he could not see his way very well  and consequently  frequently strayed from the path  on to some of the numerous flower beds which were in the way yes  said the doctor  exultingly  it must be varney  and now i have but to watch him  and not to resist him  for what good on earth is it to stop him in what he wishes to do  and  by such means  never wrest his secret from him  the only way is to let him go on  and that will i do most certainly now he heard the indistinct muttering of the voice of some one  so low that he could not catch what words were uttered  but he fancied that  in the deep tones  he recognised  without any doubt  the voice of sir francis varney it must be he  he said  it surely must be he  who else would come here to disturb the solitude of an empty house  he comes  he comes now the doctor could see a figure emerge from behind some thick beeches which had before obstructed his vision  and he looked scrutinisingly about  while some doubts stole slowly over his mind now as to whether it was the vampyre or not  the height was in favour of the supposition that it was none other than varney  but the figure looked so much stouter that mr  chillingworth felt a little staggered upon the subject  and unable wholly to make up his mind upon it the pausing of this visitor  too  opposite that window where sir francis varney had made his attempts  was another strong reason why the doctor was inclined to believe it must be him  and yet he could not quite make up his mind upon the subject  so as to speak with certainty a very short time  however  indeed  must have sufficed to set such a question as that at rest  and patience seemed the only quality of mind necessary under those circumstances for mr  chillingworth to exert the visitor continued gazing either at that window  or at the whole front of the house  for several minutes  and then he turned away from a contemplation of it  and walked slowly along  parallel with the windows of that dining room  one of which had been broken so completely on the occasion of the admiral s attempt to take the vampyre prisoner the moment the stranger altered his position  from looking at the window  and commenced walking away from it  mr  chillingworth s mind was made up  it was not varney of that he felt now most positively assured and could have no doubt whatever upon the subject the gait  the general air  the walk  all were different  and then arose the anxious question of who could it be that had intruded upon that lonely place  and what could be the object of any one else but varney the vampyre to do so the stranger looked a powerful man  and walked with a firm tread  and altogether he was an opponent that  had the doctor been ever so belligerently inclined  it would have been the height of indiscretion for him to attempt to cope with it was a very vexatious thing  too  for any one to come there at such a juncture  perhaps only from motives of curiosity  or possibly just to endeavour to commit some petty depredations upon the deserted building if possible  and most heartily did the doctor wish that  in some way  he could scare away the intruder the man walked along very slowly  indeed  and seemed to be quite taking his time in making his observations of the building  and this was the more provoking  as it was getting late  and if having projected a visit at all  it would surely soon be made  and then  when he found any one there  of course  he would go amazed beyond expression  the doctor felt about on the ground at his feet  until he found a tolerably large stone  which he threw at the stranger with so good an aim  that it hit him a smart blow on the back which must have been anything but a pleasant surprise that it was a surprise  and that  too  a most complete one  was evident from the start which the man gave  and then he uttered a furious oath and rubbed his back  as he glanced about him to endeavour to ascertain from whence the missile had come i ll try him again with that  thought the doctor  it may succeed in scaring him away  and he stooped to watch for another stone it was well that he did so at that precise moment  for  before he rose again  he heard the sharp report of a pistol  and a crashing sound among some of the old wood work of which the summer house was composed  told him that a shot had there taken effect  affairs were now getting much too serious  and  accordingly  dr  chillingworth thought that  rather than stay there to be made a target of  he would face the intruder hold hold  he cried  who are you  and what do you mean by that oh  somebody is there  cried the man  as he advanced  my friend  whoever you are  you were very foolish to throw a stone at me and  my friend  whoever you are  responded the doctor  you were very spiteful to fire a pistol bullet at me in consequence not at all but i say yes  for  probably  i can prove a right to be here  which you cannot ah  said the stranger  that voice why you are dr chillingworth i am  but i don t know you  said the doctor  as he emerged now from the summer house  and confronted the stranger who was within a few paces of the entrance to it  then he started  as he added yes  i do know you  though  how  in the name of heaven  came you here and what purpose have you in so coming what purpose have you  since we met at varney s  i have been making some inquiries about this neighbourhood  and learn strange things that you may very easily do here  and  what is more extraordinary  the strange things are  for the most part  i can assure you  quite true the reader will  from what has been said  now readily recognise this man as sir francis varney s mysterious visitor  to whom he gave  from some hidden cause or another  so large a sum of money  and between whom and dr  chillingworth a mutual recognition had taken place  on the occasion when sir francis varney had  with such cool assurance  invited the admiral to breakfast with him at his new abode you  however  said the man  i have no doubt  are fully qualified to tell me of more than i have been able to learn from other people  and first of all  let me ask you why you are here before i answer you that question  or any other  said the doctor  let me beg of you to tell me truly  is sir francis varney the doctor whispered in the ear of the stranger some name  as if he feared  even there  in the silence of that garden  where everything conspired to convince him that he could not be overheard  to pronounce it in an audible tone he is  said the other you have no manner of doubt of it doubt certainly not  what doubt can i have  i know it for a positive certainty  and he knows  of course  that i do know it  and has purchased my silence pretty handsomely  although i must confess that nothing but my positive necessities would have induced me to make the large demands upon him that i have  and i hope soon to be able to release him altogether from them the doctor shook his head repeatedly  as he said i suspected it  i suspected it  do you know  from the first moment that i saw you there in his house  his face haunted me ever since awfully haunted me  and yet  although i felt certain that i had once seen it under strange circumstances  i could not identify it with but no matter  no matter  i am waiting here for him indeed ay  that i am  and i flung a stone at you  not knowing you with hope that you would be  by such means  perhaps  scared away  and so leave the coast clear for him then you have an appointment with him by no means  but he has made such repeated and determined attacks upon this house that the family who inhabited it were compelled to leave it  and i am here to watch him  and ascertain what can possibly be his object it is as i suspected  then  muttered this man  confound him  now can i read  as if in a book  most clearly  the game that he is playing can you  cried the doctor  energetically can you  what is it  tell me  for that is the very thing i want to discover you don t say so it is  indeed  and i assure you that it concerns the peace of a whole family to know it  you say you have made inquiries about this neighbourhood  and  if you have done so  you have discovered how the family of the bannerworths have been persecuted by varney  and how  in particular  flora bannerworth  a beautiful and intelligent girl  has been most cruelly made to suffer i have heard all that  and i dare say with many exaggerations it would be difficult for any one really to exaggerate the horrors that have taken place in this house  so that any information which you can give respecting the motives of varney will tend  probably  to restore peace to those who have been so cruelly persecuted  and be an act of kindness which i think not altogether inconsistent with your nature you think so  and yet know who i am i do  indeed and what i am  why  if i were to go into the market place of yon town and proclaim myself  would not all shun me ay  even the very lowest and vilest  and yet you talk of an act of kindness not being altogether inconsistent with my nature i do  because i know something more of you than many there was a silence of some moments  duration  and then the stranger spoke in a tone of voice which looked as if he were struggling with some emotion sir  you do know more of me than many  you know what i have been  and you know how i left an occupation which would have made me loathed  but you even you do not know what made me take to so terrible a trade i do not would it suit you for me now to tell you will you first promise me that you will do all you can for this persecuted family of the bannerworths  in whom i take so strange an interest i will  i promise you that freely  of my own knowledge  of course  i can say but little concerning them  but  upon that warranting  i well believe they deserve abundant sympathy  and from me they shall have it a thousand thanks  with your assistance  i have little doubt of being able to extricate them from the tangled web of dreadful incidents which has turned them from their home  and now  whatever you may choose to tell me of the cause which drove you to be what you became  i shall listen to with abundant interest  only let me beseech you to come into this summer house  and to talk low i will  and you can pursue your watch at the same time  while i beguile its weariness be it so you knew me years ago  when i had all the chances in the world of becoming respectable and respected  i did  indeed  and you may therefore  judge of my surprise when  some years since  being in the metropolis  i met you  and you shunned my company yes  but  at last you found out why it was that i shunned your company i did  you yourself told me once that i met you  and would not leave you  but insisted upon your dining with me  then you told me  when you found that i would take no other course whatever  that you were no other than the the out with it  i can bear to hear it now better than i could then  i told you that i was the common hangman of london you did  i must confess  to my most intense surprise yes  and yet you kept to me  and  but that i respected you too much to allow you to do so  you would  from old associations  have countenanced me  but i could not  and i would not  let you do so  i told you then that  although i held the terrible office  that i had not been yet called upon to perform its loathsome functions  soon soon come the first effort it was the last indeed  you left the dreadful trade i did i did  but what i want to tell you  for i could not then  was why i went ever to it  the wounds my heart had received were then too fresh to allow me to speak of them  but i will tell you now  the story is a brief one  mr  chillingworth  i pray you be seated chapter lxxii the strange story the arrival of the mob at the hall  and their dispersion illustration you will find that the time which elapsed since i last saw you in london  to have been spent in an eventful  varied manner you were in good circumstances then  said mr  chillingworth i was  but many events happened after that which altered the prospect  made it even more gloomy than you can well imagine  but i will tell you all candidly  and you can keep watch upon bannerworth hall at the same time  you are well aware that i was well to do  and had ample funds  and inclination to spend them i recollect  but you were married then  surely i was  said the stranger  sadly  i was married then and now i am a widower  the stranger seemed much moved  but  after a moment or so he resumed i am a widower now  but how that event came about is partly my purpose to tell you  i had not married long that is very long for i have but one child  and she is not old  or of an age to know much more than what she may be taught  she is still in the course of education  i was early addicted to gamble  the dice had its charms  as all those who have ever engaged in play but too well know  it is perfectly fascinating so i have heard  said mr  chillingworth  though  for myself  i found a wife and professional pursuits quite incompatible with any pleasure that took either time or resources it is so  i would i had never entered one of those houses where men are deprived of their money and their own free will  for at the gambling table you have no liberty  save that in gliding down the stream in company with others  how few have ever escaped destruction none  i believe men are perfectly fascinated  it is ruin alone that enables a man to see how he has been hurried onwards without thought or reflection  and how fallacious were all the hopes he ever entertained yes  ruin  and ruin alone  can do this  but  alas  tis then too late the evil is done  soon after my marriage i fell in with a chevalier st  john  he was a man of the world in every sense of the word  and one that was well versed in all the ways of society  i never met with any man who was so perfectly master of himself  and of perfect ease and self confidence as he was  he was never at a loss  and  come what would  never betrayed surprise or vexation two qualities  he thought  never ought to be shown by any man who moved in society indeed he was a strange man a very strange man did he gamble it is difficult to give you a correct and direct answer  i should say he did  and yet he never lost or won much  but i have often thought he was more connected with those who did than was believed was that a fact  inquired mr  chillingworth you shall see as we go on  and be able to judge for yourself  i have thought he was  well  he first took me to a handsome saloon  where gambling was carried on  we had been to the opera  as we came out  he recommended that we should sup at a house where he was well known  and where he was in the habit of spending his evenings after the opera  and before he retired  i agreed to this  i saw no reason why i should not we went there  and bitterly have i repented of so doing for years since and do to this day your repentance has been sincere and lasting  said mr  chillingworth the one proves the other it does  but i thought not so then  the place was glittering  and the wine good  it was a kind of earthly paradise  and when we had taken some wine  the chevalier said to me i am desirous of seeing a friend backwards  he is at the hazard table will you go with me i hesitated  i feared to see the place where a vice was carried on  i knew myself inclined to prudential motives  i said to him no  st  john  i ll wait here for you  it may be as well the wine is good  and it will content me do so  he said  smiling  but remember i seldom or never play myself nor is there any reason why you should i ll go  but i will not play certainly not  you are free alike to look on  play  or quit the place at any moment you please  and not be noticed  probably  by a single soul i arose  and we walked backwards  having called one of the men who were waiting about  but who were watchers and door keepers of the hell  we were led along the passage  and passed through the pair of doors  which were well secured and rendered the possibility of a surprise almost impossible  after these dark places  we were suddenly let into a place where we were dazzled by the light and brilliancy of the saloon  it was not so large as the one we left  but it was superior to it in all its appointments at first i could not well see who was  or who was not  in the room where we were  as soon  however  as i found the use of my eyes  i noticed many well dressed men  who were busily engaged in play  and who took no notice of any one who entered  we walked about for some minutes without speaking to any one  but merely looking on  i saw men engaged in play  some with earnestness  others again with great nonchalance  and money changed hands without the least remark  there were but few who spoke  and only those in play  there was a hum of conversation  but you could not distinguish what was said  unless you paid some attention to and was in close vicinity with  the individual who spoke well  said st  john  what do you think of this place why  i replied  i had no notion of seeing a place fitted up as this is no  isn t it superb it is beautifully done  they have many visitors  said i  many more than i could have believed yes  they are all bona fide  players  men of stamp and rank none of your seedy legs who have only what they can cheat you out of ah and besides  he added  you may often form friendships here that lead to fortune hereafter  i do not mean in play  because there is no necessity for your doing so  or  if you do so  in going above a stake which you know won t hurt you exactly many men can never approach a table like this  and sit down to an hour s play  but  if they do  they must stake not only more than they can afford  but all their property  leaving themselves beggars  they do  said i but men who know themselves  their resources  and choose to indulge for a time  may often come and lay the foundation to a very pretty fortune do you see your friend  i inquired no  i do not  but i will inquire if he has been here if not  we will go he left me for a moment or two to make some inquiry  and i stood looking at the table  where there were four players  and who seemed to be engaged at a friendly game  and when one party won they looked grave and when the other party lost they smiled and looked happy  i walked away  as the chevalier did not return immediately to me  and then i saw a gentleman rise up from a table  he had evidently lost  i was standing by the seat  unconsciously holding the back in my hand  i sat down without thinking or without speaking  and found myself at the hazard table do you play  sir yes  i said  i had hardly uttered the words when i was sorry for them  but i could not recall them  i sat down  and play at once commenced in about ten or fifteen minutes  often losing and then winning  i found myself about a hundred and twenty pounds in pocket  clear gain by the play ah  said the chevalier  who came up at that moment  i thought you wouldn t play i really don t know how it happened  said i  but i suddenly found myself here without any previous intention you are not a loser  i hope indeed i am not  i replied  but not much a gainer nor need you desire to be  do you desire to give your adversary his revenge now  or take another opportunity at another time  i replied you will find me here the day after to morrow  when i shall be at your service  then bowing  he turned away he is a very rich man whom you have been playing with  said the chevalier indeed yes  and i have known him to lose for three days together  but you may take his word for any amount  he is a perfect gentleman and man of honour tis well to play with such  i replied  but i suppose you are about to leave yes  it grows late  and i have some business to transact to morrow  so i must leave i will accompany you part of the way home  said i and then i shall have finished the night i did leave with him  and accompanied him home  and then walked to my own home                                    this was my first visit  and i thought a propitious beginning  but it was the more dangerous  perhaps a loss might have effectually deterred me  but it is doubtful to tell how certain events might have been altered  it is just possible that i might have been urged on by my desire to retrieve any loss i might have incurred  and so made myself at once the miserable being it took months to accomplish in bringing me to i went the day but one after this  to meet the same individual at the gambling table  and played some time with varied success  until i left off with a trifling loss upon the night s play  which was nothing of any consequence illustration thus matters went on  i sometimes won and sometimes lost  until i won a few hundreds  and this determined me to play for higher stakes than any i had yet played for it was no use going on in the peddling style i had been going on  i had won two hundred and fifty pounds in three months  and had i been less fearful i might have had twenty five thousand pounds  ah  i ll try my fortune at a higher game having once made this resolution  i was anxious to begin my new plan which i hoped would have the effect of placing me far above my then present position in society  which was good  and with a little attention it would have made me an independent man  but then it required patience and nothing more  however  the other method was so superior since it might all be done with good luck in a few months  ah  good luck  how uncertain is good luck  how changeful is fortune  how soon is the best prospect blighted by the frosts of adversity  in less than a month i had lost more than i could pay  and then i gambled on for a living my wife had but one child  her first and only one  an infant at her breast  but there was a change came over her  for one had come over me a fearful one it was too one not only in manner but in fortune too she would beg me to come home early  to attend to other matters  and leave the dreadful life i was then leading lizzy  said i  we are ruined ruined  she exclaimed  and staggered back  until she fell into a seat  ruined ay  ruined  it is a short word  but expressive no  no  we are not ruined  i know what you mean  you would say  we cannot live as we have lived  we must retrench  and so we will  right willingly you must retrench most wonderfully  i said  with desperate calmness for the murder must out and so we will  but you will be with us you will not go out night after night  ruining your health  our happiness  and destroying both peace and prospects no  no  lizzy  we have no chance of recovering ourselves  house and home all gone all  all my god  she exclaimed ay  rail on  said i  you have cause enough  but  no matter we have lost all how how it is useless to ask how  i have done  and there is an end of the matter  you shall know more another day  we must leave this house for a lodging it matters little  she said  all may be won again  if you will but say you will quit the society of those who have ruined you no one  said i  has ruined me  i did it  it was no fault of any one else s  i have not that excuse i am sure you can recover i may  some day fortune will shower her favours upon me  and i live on in that expectation you cannot mean that you will chance the gaming table  for i am sure you must have lost all there i have god help me  she said  you have done your child a wrong but you may repair it yet never tis a long day  let me implore you  on my knees  to leave this place  and adopt some other mode of life  we can be careful  a little will do  and we shall  in time  be equal to  and better than what we have been we never can  save by chance and by chance we never shall  she replied  if you will exert yourself  we may yet retrieve ourselves and exert myself i will and quit the gaming table ask me to make no promises  said i  i may not be able to keep them therefore  ask me to make none i do ask you  beg of  entreat of you to promise  and solemnly promise me that you will leave that fearful place  where men not only lose all their goods  but the feelings of nature also say no more  lizzy  if i can get a living elsewhere i will  but if not  i must get it there she seemed to be cast down at this  and she shed tears  i left the room  and again went to the gambling house  and there that night  i won a few pounds  which enabled me to take my wife and child away from the house they had so long lived in  and took them afterwards to a miserable place one room  where  indeed  there were a few articles of furniture that i had saved from the general wreck of my own property she took things much less to heart than i could have anticipated  she seemed cheerful and happy she endeavoured to make my home as comfortable as she could her whole endeavour was to make me as much as possible  forget the past  she wanted  as much as possible  to wean me away from my gambling pursuits  but that was impossible  i had no hope  no other prospect thus she strove  but i could see each day she was getting paler  and more pale  her figure  before round  was more thin  and betrayed signs of emaciation  this preyed upon me  and  when fortune denied me the means of carrying home that which she so much wanted  i could never return for two days at a time  then i would find her shedding tears  and sighing  what could i say  if i had anything to take her  then i used to endeavour to make her forget that i had been away ah  she would exclaim  you will find me dead one of these days  what you do now for one or two days  you will do by and bye for many days perhaps weeks do not anticipate evil i cannot do otherwise  were you in any other kind of employment but that of gambling  she said  i should have some hope of you  but  as it is  there is none speak not of it  my chances may turn out favourable yet  and you may be again as you were never but fortune is inconstant  and may change in my favour as much as she has done in others fortune is indeed constant  but misfortune is as inconstant you are prophetic of evil ah  i would to heaven i could predict good  but who ever yet heard of a ruined gambler being able to retrieve himself by the same means that he was ruined thus we used to converse  but our conversation was usually of but little comfort to either of us  for we could give neither any comfort to the other  and as that was usually the case  our interviews became less frequent  and of less duration  my answer was always the same i have no other chance  my prospects are limited to that one place deprive me of that  and i never more should be able to bring you a mouthful of bread day after day day after day  the same result followed  and i was as far from success as ever i was  and ever should be  i was yet a beggar the time flew by  my little girl was nearly four years old  but she knew not the misery her father and mother had to endure  the poor little thing sometimes went without more than a meal a day  and while i was living thus upon the town  upon the chances of the gaming table  many a pang did she cause me  and so did her mother  my constant consolation was this it is bad luck now  i would say  but will be better by and bye things cannot always continue thus  it is all for them all for them i thought that by continuing constantly in one course  i must be at land at the ebb of the tide  it cannot always flow one way  i thought i had often heard people say that if you could but have the resolution to play on  you must in the end seize the turn of fortune if i could but once do that  i would never enter a hell again as long as i drew breath this was a resolve i could not only make but keep  because i had suffered so much that i would never run through the same misery again that i had already gone through  however  fortune never seemed inclined to take the turn i had hoped for  fortune was as far off as ever  and had in no case given me any opportunity of recovering myself a few pounds were the utmost i could at any time muster  and i had to keep up something of an appearance  and seem as if i had a thousand a year  when  god knows  i could not have mustered a thousandth part of that sum  were all done and paid for day after day passed on  and yet no change  i had almost given myself up to despair  when one night when i went home i saw my wife was more than usually melancholy and sad  and perhaps ill  i didn t look at her i seldom did  because her looks were always a reproach to me  i could not help feeling them so well  said i  i have come home to you because i have something to bring you  not what i ought but what i can you must be satisfied i am  she said i know also you want it  how is the child  is she quite well yes quite where is she  inquired i  looking round the room  but i didn t see her  she used to be up she has gone to bed  she said it is very early yes  but she cried so for food that i was obliged to get her to sleep to forget her hunger  poor thing  she has wanted bread very badly poor thing  i said  let her be awakened and partake of what i have brought home with that my wife waked her up  and the moment she opened her eyes she again began to cry for food  which i immediately gave her and saw her devour with the utmost haste and hunger  the sight smote my heart  and my wife sat by watching  and endeavouring to prevent her from eating so fast this is bad  i said yes  but i hope it may be the worst  she replied  in a deep and hollow voice lizzy  i exclaimed  what is the matter are you ill yes  very ill what is the matter with you  for god s sake tell me  i said  for i was alarmed i am very ill  she said  very ill indeed  i feel my strength decreasing every day  i must drink you  too  want food i have and perhaps do  though the desire to eat seems almost to have left me for heaven s sake eat  said i  i will bring you home something more by to morrow  eat and drink lizzy  i have suffered  but for you and your child s sake  i will do my best your best  she said  will kill us both  but  alas  there is no other aid at hand  you may one day however  come here too late to find us living say no more  lizzy  you know not my feelings when you speak thus alas  i have no hope no aid no friend no  she replied  your love of gaming drove them from you  because they would not aid a gambler say no more  lizzy  i said  if there be not an end to this life soon  there will be an end to me  in two days more i shall return to you  good bye  god bless you  keep up your heart and the child good bye  she said  sorrowfully  she shed tears  and wrung her hands bitterly  i hastened away my heart was ready to burst  and i could not speak i walked about to recover my serenity  but could not do so sufficiently well to secure anything like an appearance that would render me fit to go to the gaming house  that night i remained away  but i could not avoid falling into a debauch to drown my misfortunes  and shift the scene of misery that was continually before my eyes                                    the next night i was at the gaming house  i went there in better than usual spirits  i saw  i thought  a change in fortune  and hailed that as the propitious moment of my life  when i was to rise above my present misfortunes i played and won played and lost played and won  and then lost again thus i went on  fluctuating more and more  until i found i was getting money in my pocket  i had  at one moment more than three hundred pounds in my pocket  and i felt that then was my happy moment then the tide of fortune was going in my favour  i ought to have left off with that to have been satisfied with such an amount of money  but the demon of avarice seemed to have possessed me  and i went on and on with fluctuating fortune  until i lost the whole of it i was mad desperate  and could have destroyed myself  but i thought of the state my wife and child were in  i thought that that night they would want food  but they could not hurt for one day they must have some  or would procure some i was too far gone to be able to go to them  even if i were possessed of means  but i had none  and daylight saw me in a deep sleep  from which i awoke not until the next evening let in  and then i once more determined that i would make a desperate attempt to get a little money i had always paid  and thought my word would be taken for once  and  if i won  all well and good  if not  then i was no worse off than before this was easy to plan  but not to execute  i went there  but there were none present in whom i had sufficient interest to dare make the attempt i walked about  and felt in a most uncomfortable state  i feared i should not succeed at all  then what was to become of me of my wife and child  this rendered me almost mad  i could not understand what i was to do  what to attempt  or where to go  one or two persons came up  and asked me if i were ill  my answers were  that i was well enough  good god  how far from the truth was that  but i found i must place more control on my feelings  else i should cause much conversation  and then i should lose all hope of recovering myself  and all prospect of living even at length some one did come in  and i remarked i had been there all the evening and had not played  i had an invitation to play with him  which ended  by a little sleight of hand  in my favour  and on that i had calculated as much as on any good fortune i might meet  the person i played with observed it not  and  when we left off playing  i had some six or seven pounds in pocket  this  to me  was a very great sum  and the moment i could decently withdraw myself  i ran off home i was fearful of the scene that awaited me  i expected something  worse than i had yet seen  possibly lizzy might be angry  and scold as well as complain  i therefore tapped at the door gently  but heard no one answer  but of this i took no notice  as i believed that they might be and were  most probably  fast asleep  i had provided myself with a light  and i therefore opened the door  which was not fastened lizzy  said i  lizzy  there was no answer given  and i paused everything was as still as death  i looked on the bed there lay my wife with her clothes on lizzy  lizzy  said i  but still she did not answer me well  said i  she sleeps sound  and i walked towards the bed  and placed my hand upon her shoulder  and began to shake her  saying  as i did so lizzy  lizzy  i m come home  but still no answer  or signs of awaking i went on the other side of the bed to look at her face  and some misgivings overtook me  i trembled much  she lay on the bed  with her back towards the spot where i stood i came towards her face  my hand shook violently as i endeavoured to look at her  she had her eyes wide open  as if staring at me lizzy  said i  no answer was returned  i then placed my hand upon her cheek  it was enough  and i started back in great horror  she was dead this was horror itself  i staggered back and fell into a chair  the light i placed down  heaven knows how or why  but there i sat staring at the corpse of my unfortunate wife  i can hardly tell you the tremendous effect this had upon me  i could not move  i was fascinated to the spot i could not move and could not turn                                    it was morning  and the rays of the sun illumined the apartment  but there sat i  still gazing upon the face of my unfortunate wife  i saw  i knew she was dead  but yet i had not spoken  but sat looking at her i believe my heart was as cold as she was  but extreme horror and dread had dried up all the warm blood in my body  and i hardly think there was a pulsation left  the thoughts of my child never once seemed to cross my mind  i had  however  sat there long some hours before i was discovered  and this was by the landlady i had left the door open behind me  and she  in passing down  had the curiosity to peep  and saw me sitting in what she thought to be a very strange attitude  and could hear no sounds after some time she discovered my wife was dead  and  for some time she thought me so  too  however  she was convinced to the contrary  and then began to call for assistance  this awoke the child  which was nearly famished  the landlady  to become useful  and to awaken me from my lethargy  placed the child in my hands  telling me i was the best person now to take care of it and so i was  there was no doubt of the truth of that  and i was compelled to acknowledge it  i felt much pride and pleasure in my daughter  and determined she should  if i starved  have the benefit of all i could do for her in the way of care  c                                    the funeral over  i took my child and carried it to a school  where i left her  and paid in advance  promising to do so as often as the quarter came round  my wife i had seen buried by the hands of man  and i swore i would do the best for my child  and to keep this oath was a work of pleasure i determined also i would never more enter a gaming house  be the extremity what it might  i would suffer even death before i would permit myself to enter the house in which it took place i will  i thought  obtain some employment of some kind or other  i could surely obtain that  i have only to ask and i have it surely something  however menial  that would keep me and my child  yes yes she ought  she must have her charges paid at once the effect of my wife s death was a very great shock to me  and such a one i could not forget one i shall ever remember  and one that at least made a lasting impression upon me                                    strange  but true  i never entered a gambling house  it was my horror and my aversion  and yet i could obtain no employment  i took my daughter and placed her at a boarding school  and tried hard to obtain bread by labour  but  do what would  none could be had  if my soul depended upon it  i could find none  i cared not what it was anything that was honest i was reduced low very low  gaunt starvation showed itself in my cheeks  but i wandered about to find employment  none could be found and the world seemed to have conspired together to throw me back to the gaming table but this i would not  at last employment was offered  but what was it the situation of common hangman was offered me  the employment was disgusting and horrible  but  at the same time  it was all i could get and that was a sufficient inducement for me to accept of it  i was therefore  the common executioner  and in that employment for some time earned a living  it was terrible  but necessity compelled me to accept the only thing i could obtain  you now know the reason why i became what i have told you chapter lxxiii the visit of the vampire the general meeting illustration the mysterious friend of mr  chillingworth finished his narrative  and then the doctor said to him and that  then  is the real cause why you  a man evidently far above the position of life which is usually that of those who occupy the dreadful post of executioner  came to accept of it the real reason sir  i considered  too  that in holding such a humiliating situation that i was justly served for the barbarity of which i had been guilty for what can be a greater act of cruelty than to squander  as i did  in the pursuit of mad excitement  those means which should have rendered my home happy  and conduced to the welfare of those who were dependant upon me i do not mean to say that your self reproaches are unjust altogether but what noise is that  do you hear anything yes yes what do you take it to be it seemed like the footsteps of a number of persons  and it evidently approaches nearer and nearer  i know not what to think shall i tell you  said a deep toned voice  and some one  through the orifice in the back of the summer house  which  it will be recollected sustained some damage at the time that varney escaped from it  laid a hand upon mr  chillingworth s shoulder  god bless me  exclaimed the doctor  who s that  and he sprang from his seat with the greatest perturbation in the world varney  the vampyre  added the voice  and then both the doctor and his companion recognised it  and saw the strange  haggard features  that now they knew so well  confronting them  there was a pause of surprise  for a moment or two  on the part of the doctor  and then he said  sir francis varney  what brings you here  i conjure you to tell me  in the name of common justice and common feeling  what brings you to this house so frequently  you have dispossessed the family  whose property it is of it  and you have caused great confusion and dismay over a whole county  i implore you now  not in the language of menace or as an enemy but as the advocate of the oppressed  and one who desires to see justice done to all  to tell me what it is you require there is no time now for explanation  said varney  if explanations were my full and free intent  you wished to know what noise was that you heard i did  can you inform me i can  the wild and lawless mob which you and your friends first induced to interfere in affairs far beyond their or your control  are now flushed with the desire of riot and of plunder the noise you hear is that of their advancing footsteps  they come to destroy bannerworth hall can that be possible  the bannerworth family are the sufferers from all that has happened  and not the inflictors of suffering ay  be it so but he who once raises a mob has raised an evil spirit  which  in the majority of cases  it requires a far more potent spell than he is master of to quell again it is so  that is a melancholy truth  but you address me  sir francis varney  as if i led on the mob  when in reality i have done all that lay in my power  from the very first moment of their rising on account of this affair  which  in the first instance  was your work  to prevent them from proceeding to acts of violence it may be so  but if you have now any regard for your own safety you will quit this place  it will too soon become the scene of a bloody contention  a large party of dragoons are even now by another route coming towards it  and it will be their duty to resist the aggressions of the mob  then should the rioters persevere  you can guess the result i can  indeed retire then while you may  and against the bad deeds of sir francis varney at all events place some of his good ones  that he may not seem wholly without one redeeming trait i am not accustomed  said the doctor  to paint the devil blacker than he really is  but yet the cruel persecutions that the bannerworth family have endured call aloud for justice  you still  with a perseverance which shows you regardless of what others suffer so that you compass your own ends  hover round a spot which you have rendered desolate hark  sir  do you not hear the tramp of horses  feet i do the noise made by the feet of the insurgents was now almost drowned in the louder and more rapid tramp of the horses  feet of the advancing dragoons  and  in a few moments more  sir francis varney waved his arm exclaiming they are here  will you not consult your safety by flight no  said mr  chillingworth s companion  we prefer remaining here at the risk even of whatever danger may accrue to us fools  would you die in a chance melee  between an infuriated populace and soldiery do not leave  whispered the ex hangman to mr chillingworth  do not leave  i pray you  he only wants to have the hall to himself there could be no doubt now of the immediate appearance of the cavalry and  before sir francis varney could utter another word  a couple of the foremost of the soldiers cleared the garden fence at a part where it was low  and alighted not many feet from the summer house in which this short colloquy was taking place  sir francis varney uttered a bitter oath  and immediately disappeared in the gloom what shall we do  said the hangman you can do what you like  but i shall avow my presence to the military  and claim to be on their side in the approaching contest  if it should come to one  which i sincerely hope it will not the military detachment consisted of about twenty five dragoons  who now were all in the gardens  an order was given by the officer in command for them to dismount  which was at once obeyed  and the horses were fastened by their bridles to the various trees with which the place abounded they are going to oppose the mob on foot  with their carbines  said the hangman  there will be sad work here i am afraid well  at all events  said mr  chillingworth  i shall decline acting the part of a spy here any longer  so here goes hilloa  a friend a friend here  in the summer house make it two friends  cried the hangman  if you please  while you are about it a couple of the dragoons immediately appeared  and the doctor  with his companion  were marched  as prisoners  before the officer in command what do you do here  he said  i was informed that the hall was deserted  here  orderly  where is mr  adamson  the magistrate  who came with me close at hand sir  and he says he s not well well  or ill  he must come here  and do something with these people a magistrate of the district who had accompanied the troops  and been accommodated with a seat behind one of the dragoons  which seemed very much to have disagreed with him  for he was as pale as death  now stepped forward you know me  mr  adamson  said the doctor  i am mr chillingworth oh  yes  lord bless you  how came you here never mind that just now  you can vouch for my having no connection with the rioters oh  dear  yes  certainly  this is a respectable gentleman  captain richardson  and a personal friend of mine oh  very good and i  said the doctor s companion  am likewise a respectable and useful member of society  and a great friend of mr chillingworth well  gentlemen  said the captain in command  you may remain here  if you like  and take the chances  or you may leave they intimated that they preferred remaining  and  almost at the moment that they did so  a loud shout from many throats announced the near approach of the mob now  mr  magistrate  if you please  said the officer  you will be so good as to tell the mob that i am here with my troop  under your orders  and strongly advise them to be off while they can  with whole skins  for if they persevere in attacking the place  we must persevere in defending it  and  if they have half a grain of sense among them  they can surely guess what the result of that will be i will do the best i can  as heaven is  my judge  said the magistrate to produce a peaceable recall more no man can do hurrah  hurrah  shouted the mob  down with the vampyre  down with the hall  and then one  more candid than his fellows  shouted down with everything and everybody ah  remarked the officer  that fellow now knows what he came about a great number of torches and links were lighted by the mob  but the moment the glare of light fell upon the helmets and accoutrements of the military  there was a pause of consternation on the part of the multitude  and mr  adamson  urged on by the officer  who  it was evident  by no means liked the service he was on  took advantage of the opportunity  and  stepping forward  he said my good people  and fellow townsmen  let me implore you to listen to reason  and go to your homes in peace  if you do not  but  on the contrary  in defiance of law and good order  persist in attacking this house  it will become my painful duty to read the riot act  and then the military and you will have to fight it out together  which i beg you will avoid  for you know that some of you will be killed  and a lot more of you receive painful wounds  now disperse  let me beg of you  at once there seemed for a moment a disposition among the mob to give up the contest  but there were others among them who were infuriated with drink  and so regardless of all consequences  those set up a shout of down with the red coats  we are englishmen  and will do what we like some one then threw a heavy stone  which struck one of the soldiers  and brought blood from his cheek  the officer saw it  but he said at once stand firm  now  stand firm  no anger steady twenty pounds for the man who threw that stone  said the magistrate twenty pound ten for old adamson  the magistrate  cried a voice in the crowd  which  no doubt came from him who had cast the missile then  at least fifty stones were thrown  some of which hit the magistrate  and the remainder came rattling upon the helmets of the dragoons  like a hail shower i warn you  and beg of you to go  said mr  adamson  for the sake of your wives and families  i beg of you not to pursue this desperate game loud cries now arose of down with the soldiers  down with the vampyre he s in bannerworth hall  smoke him out  and then one or two links were hurled among the dismounted dragoons  all this was put up with patiently  and then again the mob were implored to leave  which being answered by fresh taunts  the magistrate proceeded to read the riot act not one word of which was audible amid the tumult that prevailed put out all the lights  cried a voice among the mob  the order was obeyed  and the same voice added  they dare not fire on us  come on and a rush was made at the garden wall make ready present  cried the officer  and then he added  in an under tone  above their heads  now fire there was a blaze of light for a moment  a stunning noise  a shout of dismay from the mob  and in another moment all was still there  said dr  chillingworth  that this is  at all events  a bloodless victory you may depend upon that  said his companion  but is not there some one yet remaining  look there  do you not see a figure clambering over the fence yes  i do  indeed  ah  they have him a prisoner  at all events  those two dragoons have him  fast enough  we shall now  perhaps  hear from this fellow who is the actual ringleader in such an affair  which  but for the pusillanimity of the mob  might have turned out to be really most disastrous it was strange how one man should think it expedient to attack the military post after the mob had been so completely routed at the first discharge of fire arms  but so it was  one man did make an attempt to enter the garden  and it was so rapid and so desperate an one  that he rather seemed to throw himself bodily at the fence  which separated it from the meadows without  than to clamber over it  as any one under ordinary circumstances  who might wish to effect an entrance by that means  would have done he was no sooner  however  perceived  than a couple of the dismounted soldiers stepped forward and made a prisoner of him good god  exclaimed mr  chillingworth  as they approached nearer with him  good god  what is the meaning of that  do my eyes deceive me  or are they  indeed  so blessed blessed by what  exclaimed the hangman by a sight of the long lost  deeply regretted charles holland charles charles  is that indeed you  or some unsubstantial form in your likeness charles holland  for it was  indeed  himself  heard the friendly voice of the doctor  and he called out to him speak to me of flora  oh  speak to me of flora  if you would not have me die at once of suspense  and all the torture of apprehension she lives and is well thank heaven  do with me what you please dr  chillingworth sprang forward  and addressing the magistrate  he said sir  i know this gentleman  he is no one of the rioters  but a dear friend of the family of the bannerworths  charles holland  what in the name of heaven had become of you so long  and what brought you here at such a juncture as this i am faint  said charles  i i only arrived as the crowd did  i had not strength to fight my way through them  and was compelled to pause until they had dispersed can can you give me water here s something better  said one of the soldiers  as he handed a flask to charles  who partook of some of the contents  which greatly revived him  indeed i am better now  he said  thank you kindly  take me into the house good god  why is it made a point of attack  where are flora and henry are they all well  and my uncle  oh  what must you all have thought of my absence  but you cannot have endured a hundredth part of what i have suffered  let me look once again upon the face of flora  take me into the house release him  said the officer  as he pointed to his head  and looked significantly  as much as to say  some mad patient of yours  i suppose you are much mistaken  sir  said dr  chillingworth  this gentleman has been cruelly used  i have no doubt  he has  i am inclined to believe  been made the victim  for a time  of the intrigues of that very sir francis varney  whose conduct has been the real cause of all the serious disturbances that have taken place in the country confound sir francis varney  muttered the officer  he is enough to set a whole nation by the ears  however  mr  magistrate  if you are satisfied that this young man is not one of the rioters  i have  of course  no wish to hold him a prisoner i can take mr  chillingworth s word for more than that  said the magistrate charles holland was accordingly released  and then the doctor  in hurried accents  told him the principal outlines of what had occurred oh  take me to flora  he said  let me not delay another moment in seeking her  and convincing her that i could not have been guilty of the baseness of deserting her hark you  mr  holland  i have quite made up my mind that i will not leave bannerworth hall yet  but you can go alone  and easily find them by the directions which i will give you  only let me beg of you not to go abruptly into the presence of flora  she is in an extremely delicate state of health  and although i do not take upon myself to say that a shock of a pleasurable nature would prove of any paramount bad consequence to her  yet it is as well not to risk it i will be most careful  you may depend at this moment there was a loud ringing at the garden bell  and  when it was answered by one of the dragoons  who was ordered to do so by his officer  he came back  escorting no other than jack pringle  who had been sent by the admiral to the hall  but who had solaced himself so much on the road with divers potations  that he did not reach it till now  which was a full hour after the reasonable time in which he ought to have gone the distance illustration jack was not to say dumb  but he had had enough to give him a very jolly sort of feeling of independence  and so he came along quarrelling with the soldier all the way  the latter only laughing and keeping his temper admirably well  under a great deal of provocation why  you land lubbers  cried jack  what do you do here  all of you  i wonder  you are all wamphighers  i ll be bound  every one of you  you mind me of marines  you do  and that s quite enough to turn a proper seaman s stomach  any day in the week the soldier only laughed  and brought jack up to the little group of persons consisting of dr  chillingworth  the hangman  charles holland and the officer why  jack pringle  said dr  chillingworth  stepping before charles  so that jack should not see him why  jack pringle  what brings you here a slight squall  sir  to the nor west  brought you something to eat jack produced a bottle to drink  you mean well  it s all one  only in this here shape  you see  it goes down better  i m thinking  which does make a little difference somehow how is the admiral oh  he s as stupid as ever  lord bless you  he d be like a ship without a rudder without me  and would go swaying about at the mercy of winds and waves  poor old man  he s bad enough as it is  but if so be i wasn t to give the eye to him as i does  bless my heart if i thinks as he d be above hatches long  here s to you all jack took the cork from the bottle he had with him  and there came from it a strong odour of rum  then he placed it to his lips  and was enjoying the pleasant gurgle of the liquor down his throat  when charles stepped up to him  and laying hold of the lower end of the bottle  he dragged it from his mouth  saying how dare you talk in the way you have of my uncle  you drunken mutinous rascal  and behind his back too the voice of charles holland was as well known to jack pringle as that of the admiral  and his intense astonishment at hearing himself so suddenly addressed by one  of whose proximity he had not the least idea made some of the rum go  what is popularly termed  the wrong way  and nearly choked him he reeled back  till he fell over some obstruction  and then down he sat on a flower bed  while his eyes seemed ready to come out of his head avast heavings  he cried  who s that come  come  said charles holland  don t pretend you don t know me  i will not have my uncle spoken of in a disrespectful manner by you well  shiver my timbers  if that ain t our nevey  why  charley  my boy how are you  here we are in port at last  won t the old commodore pipe his eye  now  whew  here s a go  i ve found our nevey  after all you found him  said dr  chillingworth  now  that is as great a piece of impudence as ever i heard in all my life  you mean that he has found you  and found you out  too  you drunken fellow  jack  you get worse and worse every day ay  ay  sir what  you admit it ay  ay  sir  now  master charley  i tell you what it is  i shall take you off to your old uncle  you shore going sneak and you ll have to report what cruise you ve been upon all this while  leaving the ship to look after itself  lord love you all  if it hadn t been for me i don t know what anybody would have done i only know of the result  said dr chillingworth  that would ensue if it were not for you  and that would consist in a great injury to the revenue  in consequence of the much less consumption of rum and other strong liquors i ll be hanged up at the yard if i understands what you mean  said jack  as if i ever drunk anything i  of all people in the world  i am ashamed of you  you are drunk several of the dragoons had to turn aside to keep themselves from laughing  and the officer himself could not forbear from a smile as he said to the doctor sir  you seem to have many acquaintances  and by some means or another they all have an inclination to come here to night  if  however  you consider that you are bound to remain here from a feeling that the hall is threatened with any danger  you may dismiss that fear  for i shall leave a picquet here all night no  sir  replied dr  chillingworth  it is not that i fear now  after the manner in which they have been repulsed  any danger to the hall from the mob  but i have reasons for wishing to be in it or near it for some time to come as you please charles  do not wait for or accept the guidance of that drunken fellow but go yourself with a direction which i will write down for you in a leaf of my pocket book drunken fellow  exclaimed jack  who had now scrambled to his feet who do you call a drunken fellow why you  unquestionably well  now  that is hard  come along  nevey  i ll shew you where they all are  i could walk a plank on any deck with any man in the service  i could  come along  my boy  come along you can accept of him as a guide if you like  of course  said the doctor  he may be sober enough to conduct you i think he can  said charles  lead on  jack  but mark me  i shall inform my uncle of this intemperance  as well as of the manner in which you let your tongue wag about him behind his back  unless you promise to reform he is long past all reformation  remarked dr  chillingworth  it is out of the question and i am afraid my uncle will not have courage to attempt such an ungrateful task  when there is so little chance of success  replied charles holland  shaking the worthy doctor by the hand  farewell  for the present  sir  the next time i see you  i hope we shall both be more pleasantly situated come along  nevey  interrupted jack pringle  now you ve found your way back  the first thing you ought to do  is to report yourself as having come aboard  follow me  and i ll soon show yer the port where the old hulk s laid hisself up jack walked on first  tolerably steady  if one may take into account his divers deep potations  and charles holland  anticipating with delight again looking upon the face of his much loved flora  followed closely behind him we can well imagine the world of delightful thoughts that came crowding upon him when jack  after rather a long walk  announced that they were now very near the residence of the object of his soul s adoration we trust that there is not one of our readers who  for one moment  will suppose that charles holland was the sort of man to leave even such a villain and double faced hypocrite as marchdale  to starve amid the gloomy ruins where he was immured far from charles s intentions was any such thing  but he did think that a night passed there  with no other company than his own reflections would do him a world of good  and was  at all events  no very great modicum of punishment for the rascality with which he had behaved besides  even during that night there were refreshments in the shape of bread and water  such as had been presented to charles himself  within marchdale s reach as they had been within his that individual now  charles thought  would have a good opportunity of testing the quality of that kind of food  and of finding out what an extremely light diet it was for a strong man to live upon but in the morning it was charles s intention to take henry bannerworth and the admiral with him to the ruins  and then and there release the wretch from his confinement  on condition that he made a full confession of his villanies before those persons oh  how gladly would marchdale have exchanged the fate which actually befell him for any amount of personal humiliation  always provided that it brought with it a commensurate amount of personal safety but that fate was one altogether undreamt of by charles holland  and wholly without his control it was a fate which would have been his  but for the murderous purpose which had brought marchdale to the dungeon  and those happy accidents which had enabled charles to change places with him  and breathe the free  cool  fresh air  while he left his enemy loaded with the same chains that had encumbered his limbs so cruelly  and lying on that same damp dungeon floor  which he thought would be his grave we mentioned that as charles left the ruins  the storm  which had been giving various indications of its coming  seemed to be rapidly approaching it was one of these extremely local tempests which expend all their principal fury over a small space of country  and  in this instance  the space seemed to include little more than the river  and the few meadows which immediately surrounded it  and lent it so much of its beauty marchdale soon found that his cries were drowned by the louder voices of the elements  the wailing of the wind among the ancient ruins was much more full of sound than his cries  and  now and then  the full mouthed thunder filled the air with such a volume of roaring  and awakened so many echoes among the ruins  that  had he possessed the voices of fifty men  he could not have hoped to wage war with it and then  although we know that charles holland would have encountered death himself  rather than he would have willingly left anything human to expire of hunger in that dungeon  yet marchdale  judging of others by himself  felt by no means sure of any such thing  and  in his horror of apprehension  fancied that that was just the sort of easy  and pleasant and complete revenge that it was in charles holland s power to take  and just the one which would suggest itself  under the circumstances  to his mind could anything be possibly more full of horror than such a thought death  let it come in any shape it may  is yet a most repulsive and unwelcome guest  but  when it comes  so united with all that can add to its terrors  it is enough to drive reason from its throne  and fill the mind with images of absolute horror tired of shrieking  for his parched lips and clogged tongue would scarcely now permit him to utter a sound higher than a whisper marchdale lay  listening to the furious storm without  in the last abandonment of despair oh  what a death is this  he groaned  here  alone all alone and starvation to creep on me by degrees  sapping life s energies one by one  already do i feel the dreadful sickening weakness growing on me help  oh  help me heav no  no  dare i call on heaven to help me  is there no fiend of darkness who now will bid me a price for a human soul is there not one who will do so not one who will rescue me from the horror that surrounds me  for heaven will not  i dare not ask mercy there the storm continued louder and louder  the wind  it is true  was nearly hushed  but the roar and the rattle of the echo awakening thunder fully made up for its cessation  while  now and then  even there  in that underground abode  some sudden reflection of the vivid lightning s light would find its way  lending  for a fleeting moment  sufficient light to marchdale  wherewith he could see the gloomy place in which he was at times he wept  and at times he raved  while ever and anon he made such frantic efforts to free himself from the chains that were around him  that  had they not been strong  he must have succeeded  but  as it was  he only made deep indentations into his flesh  and gave himself much pain charles holland  he shouted  oh  release me  varney  varney  why do you not come to save me  i have toiled for you most unrequitedly i have not had my reward  let it all consist in my release from this dreadful bondage  help  help  oh  help there was no one to hear him  the storm continued  and now  suddenly  a sudden and a sharper sound than any awakened by the thunder s roar came upon his startled ear  and  in increased agony  he shouted what is that  oh  what is that  god of heaven  do my fears translate that sound aright  can it be  oh  can it be  that the ruins which have stood for so many a year are now crumbling down before the storm of to night the sound came again  and he felt the walls of the dungeon in which he was shake  now there could be no doubt but that the lightning had struck some part of the building  and so endangered the safety of all that was above ground  for a moment there came across his brain such a rush of agony  that he neither spoke nor moved  had that dreadful feeling continued much longer  he must have lapsed into insanity  but that amount of mercy for mercy it would have been was not shown to him  he still felt all the accumulating horrors of his situation  and then  with such shrieks as nothing but a full appreciation of such horrors could have given him strength to utter  he called upon earth  upon heaven and upon all that was infernal  to save him from his impending doom all was in vain  it was an impending doom which nothing but the direct interposition of heaven could have at all averted  and it was not likely that any such perversion of the regular laws of nature would take place to save such a man as marchdale again came the crashing sound of falling stones  and he was certain that the old ruins  which had stood for so many hundred years the storm  and the utmost wrath of the elements  was at length yielding  and crumbling down what else could he expect but to be engulphed among the fragments fragments still weighty and destructive  although in decay how fearfully now did his horrified imagination take in at one glance as it were  a panoramic view of all his past life  and how absolutely contemptible  at that moment  appeared all that he had been striving for but the walls shake again  and this time the vibration is more fearful than before  there is a tremendous uproar above him the roof yields to some superincumbent pressure there is one shriek  and marchdale lies crushed beneath a mass of masonry that it would take men and machinery days to remove from off him all is over now  that bold  bad man that accomplished hypocrite that mendacious  would be murderer was no more  he lies but a mangled crushed  and festering corpse may his soul find mercy with his god the storm  from this moment  seemed to relax in its violence  as if it had accomplished a great purpose  and  consequently  now  need no longer vex the air with its boisterous presence  gradually the thunder died away in the distance  the wind no longer blew in blustrous gusts  but with a gentle murmuring  swept around the ancient pile  as if singing the requiem of the dead that lay beneath that dead which mortal eyes were never to look upon chapter lxxiv the meeting of charles and flora illustration charles holland followed jack pringle for some time in silence from bannerworth hall  his mind was too full of thought concerning the past to allow him to indulge in much of that kind of conversation in which jack pringle might be fully considered to be a proficient as for jack  somehow or another  he had felt his dignity offended in the garden of bannerworth hall  and he had made up his mind  as he afterwards stated in his own phraseology  not to speak to nobody till somebody spoke to him a growing anxiety  however  to ascertain from one who had seen her lately  how flora had borne his absence  at length induced charles holland to break his self imposed silence jack  he said  you have had the happiness of seeing her lately  tell me  does flora bannerworth look as she was wont to look  or have all the roses faded from her cheeks why  as for the roses  said jack  i m blowed if i can tell  and seeing as how she don t look at me much  i doesn t know nothing about her  i can tell you something  though  about the old admiral that will make you open your eyes indeed  jack  and what may that be why  he s took to drink  and gets groggy about every day of his life and the most singular thing is  that when that s the case with the old man  he says it s me indeed  jack  taken to drinking has my poor old uncle  from grief  i suppose  jack  at my disappearance no  i don t think it s grief  said jack  it strikes me it s rum and water alas  alas  i never could have imagined he could have fallen into that habit of yours  he always seemed so far from anything of this kind ay  ay  sir  said jack  i know d you d be astonished  it will be the death of him  that s my opinion  and the idea  you know  master charles of accusing me when he gets drunk himself i believe that is a common delusion of intemperate persons  said charles is it  sir  well  it s a very awkward i thing  because you know  sir as well as most people  that i m not the fellow to take a drop too much i cannot say  jack  that i know so much  for i have certainly heard my uncle accuse you of intoxication lor  sir  that was all just on account of his trying it hisself  he was a thinking on it then  and wanted to see how i d take it but tell me of flora  are you quite certain that she has had no more alarms from varney what  that ere vampyre fellow  not a bit of it  your honour  lor  bless you  he must have found out by some means or another that i was on the look out  and that did the business  he ll never come near miss flora again  i ll be bound  though to be sure we moved away from the hall on account of him  but not that i saw the good of cruising out of one s own latitude  but somehow or another you see the doctor and the admiral got it into their heads to establish a sort of blockade  and the idea of the thing was to sail away in the night quite quiet  and after that take up a position that would come across the enemy on the larboard tack  if so be as he made his appearance oh  you allude to watching the hall  i presume ay  ay  sir  just so  but would you believe it  master charlie  the admiral and the doctor got so blessed drunk that i could do nothing with em indeed yes  they did indeed  and made all kinds of queer mistakes  so that the end of all that was  that the vampyre did come  but he got away again he did come then  sir francis varney came again after the house was presumed to be deserted he did  sir that is very strange  what on earth could have been his object  this affair is most inexplicably mysterious  i hope the distance  jack  is not far that you re taking me  for i m incapable of enduring much fatigue not a great way  your honour  keep two points to the westward  and sail straight on  we ll soon come to port  my eye  won t there be a squall when you get in  i expect as miss flora will drop down as dead as a herring  for she doesn t think you re above the hatches a good thought  jack  my sudden appearance may produce alarm  when we reach the place of abode of the bannerworths  you shall precede me  and prepare them in some measure for my reception very good  sir  do you see that there little white cottage a head there in the offing yes  yes  is that the place yes  your honour  that s the port to which we are bound well  then  jack  you hasten a head  and see miss flora  and be sure you prepare her gently and by degrees  you know  jack  for my appearance  so that she shall not be alarmed ay  ay  sir  i understand  you wait here  and i ll go and do it  there would be a squall if you were to make your appearance  sir  all at once she looks upon you as safely lodged in davy s locker  she minds me  all the world  of a girl i knew at portsmouth  called bet bumplush  she was one of your delicate little creatures as don t live long in this here world  no  blow me  when i came home from a eighteen months  cruise once i seed her drinking rum out of a quart pot  so i says  hilloa what cheer  and only to think now of the wonderful effect that there had upon her  with that very pot she gives the fellow as was standing treat a knobber on the head as lasted him three weeks  she was too good for this here world  she was  and too rummantic  go to blazes  she says to him  here s jack pringle come home very romantic indeed  said charles yes  i believe you  sir  and that puts me in mind of miss flora and you an extremely flattering comparison  of course i feel much obliged oh  don t name it  sir  the british tar as can t oblige a feller cretor is unworthy to tread the quarter deck  or to bear a hand to the distress of a woman very well  said charles  now  as we are here  precede me  if you please  and let me beg of you to be especially cautious in your manner of announcing me ay  ay  sir  said jack  and away he walked towards the cottage leaving charles some distance behind flora and the admiral were sitting together conversing  the old man  who loved her as if she had been a child of his own  was endeavouring  to the extent of his ability  to assuage the anguish of her thoughts  which at that moment chanced to be bent upon charles holland nevermind  my dear  he said  he ll turn up some of these days  and when he does  i sha n t forget to tell him that it was you who stood out for his honesty and truth  when every one else was against him including myself  an old wretch that i was oh  sir  how could you for one moment believe that those letters could have been written by your nephew charles  they carried  sir  upon the face of them their own refutation  and i m only surprised that for one instant you  or any one who knew him  could have believed him capable of writing them avast  there  said the admiral  that ll do  i own you got the better of the old sailor there  i think you and jack pringle were the only two persons who stood out from the first then i honour jack for doing so and here he is  said the admiral  and you d better tell him  the mutinous rascal  he wants all the honour he can get  as a set off against his drunkenness and other bad habits jack walked into the room  looked about him in silence for a moment thrust his hands in his breeches pockets  and gave a long whistle what s the matter now  said the admiral d me  if charles holland ain t outside  and i ve come to prepare you for the blessed shock  said jack  don t faint either of you  because i m only going to let you know it by degrees  you know a shriek burst from flora s lips  and she sprung to the door of the apartment what  cried the admiral  my nephew my nephew charles  jack  you rascal  if you re joking  it s the last joke you shall make in this world  and if it s true  i i i m an old fool  that s all ay  ay  sir  said jack  didn t you know that afore charles charles  cried flora  he heard the voice  her name escaped his lips  and rang with a pleasant echo through the house in another moment he was in the room  and had clasped her to his breast my own my beautiful my true charles  dear charles oh  flora  what have i not endured since last we met  but this repays me more than repays me for all what is the past now  cried flora what are all its miseries placed against this happy  happy moment d me  nobody thinks of me  said the admiral my dear uncle  said charles  looking over flora s shoulder  as he still held her in his arms  is that you yes  yes  swab  it is me  and you know it  but give us your five  you mutinous vagabond  and i tell you what  i ll do you the greatest favour i ve had an opportunity of doing you some time i ll leave you alone you dog  come along  jack ay  ay  sir  said jack  and away they went out of the apartment and now those two loving hearts were alone they who had been so long separated by malignant destiny  once again were heart to heart  looking into each other s faces with all the beaming tenderness of an affection of the truest  holiest character the admiral had done a favour to them both to leave them alone  although we much doubt whether his presence  or the presence of the whole world would have had the effect of controlling one generous sentiment of noble feeling they would have forgotten everything but that they were together  and that once again each looked into the other s eyes with all the tenderness of a love purer and higher than ordinarily belongs to mortal affections language was weak to give utterance to the full gust of happy feelings that now were theirs  it was ecstasy enough to feel  to know that the evil fortune which had so long separated them  depriving each existence of its sunniest aspect  was over  it was enough for charles holland to feel that she loved him still  it was enough for flora bannerworth to know  as she looked into his beaming countenance  that that love was not misplaced  but was met by feelings such as she herself would have dictated to be the inhabitants of the heart of him whom she would have chosen from the mass of mankind as her own flora dear flora  said charles  and you have never doubted me i ve never doubted  charles  heaven or you  to doubt one would have been  to doubt both generous and best of girls  what must you have thought of my enforced absence  oh  flora  i was unjust enough to your truth to make my greatest pang the thought that you might doubt me  and cast me from your heart for ever ah  charles  you ought to have known me better  i stood amid sore temptation to do so much  there were those who would have urged me on to think that you had cast me from your heart for ever  there were those ready and willing to place the worst construction upon your conduct  and with a devilish ingenuity to strive to make me participate in such a feeling  but  no  charles  no i loved you  and i trusted you  and i could not so far belie my own judgment as to tell you other than what you always seemed to my young fancy and you are right  my flora  right  and is it not a glorious triumph to see that love that sentiment of passion has enabled you to have so enduring and so noble a confidence in aught human ay  charles  it is the sentiment of passion  for our love has been more a sentiment than a passion  i would fain think that we had loved each other with an affection not usually known  appreciated  or understood and so  in the vanity of my best affections  i would strive to think them something exclusive  and beyond the common feelings of humanity and you are right  my flora  such love as yours is the exception  there may be preferences  there may be passions  and there may be sentiments but never  never  surely  was there a heart like yours nay  charles  now you speak from a too poetical fancy  but is it possible that i have had you here so long  with your hand clasped in mine  and asked you not the causes of your absence oh  flora  i have suffered much much physically  but more mentally  it was the thought of you that was at once the bane and the antidote of my existence indeed  charles  did i present myself in such contradictory colours to you yes  dearest  as thus  when i thought of you  sometimes  in the deep seclusion of a dungeon  that thought almost goaded me to madness because it brought with it the conviction a conviction peculiar to a lover that none could so effectually stand between you and all evil as myself yes  yes  charles  most true it seemed to me as if all the world in arms could not have protected you so well as this one heart  clad in the triple steel of its affections  could have shielded you from evil ay  charles  and then i was the bane of your existence  because i filled you with apprehension for a time  dearest  and then came the antidote  for when exhausted alike in mind and body when lying helpless  with chains upon my limbs when expecting death at every visit of those who had dragged me from light and from liberty  and from love  it was but the thought of thy beauty and thy affection that nerved me  and gave me a hope even amidst the cruellest disaster and then and then  charles you were my blessing  as you have ever been as you are  and as you will ever be my own flora  my beautiful my true we won t go so far as to say it is the fact  but  from a series of singular sounds which reached even to the passage of the cottage  we have our own private opinion to the effect  that charles began kissing flora at the top of her forehead  and never stopped  somehow or another till he got down to her chin no  not her chin her sweet lips he could not get past them  perhaps it was wrong  but we can t help it we are faithful chroniclers  reader  if you be of the sterner sex  what would you have done if of the gentler  what would you have permitted chapter lxxv mutual explanations  and the visit to the ruins illustration during the next hour  charles informed flora of the whole particulars of his forcible abduction  and to his surprise he heard  of course  for the first time  of those letters  purporting to be written by him  which endeavoured to give so bad an aspect to the fact of his sudden disappearance from bannerworth hall flora would insist upon the admiral  henry  and the rest of the family hearing all that charles had to relate concerning mr  marchdale  for well she knew that her mother  from early associations  was so far impressed in the favour of that hypocritical personage  that nothing but damning facts  much to his prejudice  would suffice to convince her of the character he really was but she was open to conviction  and when she really found what a villain she had cherished and given her confidence to  she shed abundance of tears  and blamed herself exceedingly as the cause of some of the misfortunes which had fallen upon her children very good  said the admiral  i ain t surprised a bit  i knew he was a vagabond from the first time i clapped eyes upon him  there was a down look about the fellow s figure head that i didn t like  and be hanged to him  but i never thought he would have gone the length he has done  and so you say you ve got him safe in the ruins  charles i have  indeed  uncle and then there let him remain  and a good place  too  for him no  uncle  no  i m sure you speak without thought  i intend to release him in a few hours  when i have rested from my fatigues  he could not come to any harm if he were to go without food entirely for the time that i leave him  but even that he will not do  for there is bread and water in the dungeon bread and water  that s too good for him  but  however  charles  when you go to let him out  i ll go with you  just to tell him what i think of him  the vagabond he must suffer amazingly  for no doubt knowing well  as he does  his own infamous intentions  he will consider that if i were to leave him to starve to death  i should be but retailing upon him the injuries he would have inflicted upon me the worst of it is  said the admiral  i can t think what to do with him do nothing  uncle  but just let him go  it will be a sufficient punishment for such a man to feel that  instead of succeeding in his designs  he has only brought upon himself the bitterest contempt of those whom he would fain have injured  i can have no desire for revenge on such a man as marchdale you are right  charles  said flora  let him go  and let him go with a feeling that he has acquired the contempt of those whose best opinions might have been his for a far less amount of trouble than he has taken to acquire their worst excitement had kept up charles to this point  but now  when he arose and expressed his intention of going to the ruins  for the purpose of releasing marchdale  he exhibited such unequivocal symptoms of exhaustion and fatigue that neither his uncle nor flora would permit him to go  so  in deference to them  he gave up the point  and commissioned the admiral and jack  with henry  to proceed to the place  and give the villain his freedom  little suspecting what had occurred since he had himself left the neighbourhood of those ruins of course charles holland couldn t be at all accountable for the work of the elements  and it was not for him to imagine that when he left marchdale in the dungeon that so awful a catastrophe as that we have recorded to the reader was to ensue the distance to the ruins was not so great from this cottage even as it was from bannerworth hall  provided those who went knew the most direct and best road to take  so that the admiral was not gone above a couple of hours  and when he returned he sat down and looked at charles with such a peculiar expression  that the latter could not for the life of him tell what to make of it illustration something has happened  uncle  he said  i am certain  tell me at once what it is oh  nothing  nothing  said the admiral  of any importance is that what you call your feelings  said jack pringle  can t you tell him as there came on a squall last night  and the ruins have come in with a dab upon old marchdale  crushing his guts  so that we smelt him as soon as we got nigh at hand good god  said charles  has such a catastrophe occurred yes  charles  that s just about the catastrophe that has occurred  he s dead  and rum enough it is that it should happen on the very night that you escaped rum  said jack  suddenly  my eye  who mentions rum  what a singular sort of liquor rum must be  i heard of a chap as used to be fond of it once on board a ship  i wonder if there s any in the house no  said the admiral  but there s a fine pump of spring water outside if you feel a little thirsty  jack  and i ll engage it shall do you more good than all the rum in the world uncle  said charles  i m glad to hear you make that observation what for why  to deal candidly with you  uncle  jack informed me that you had lately taken quite a predilection for drinking me  cried the admiral  why the infernal rascal  i ve had to threaten him with his discharge a dozen times  at least  on that very ground  and no other there s somebody calling me  said jack  i m a coming  i m a coming and  so he bolted out of the room  just in time to escape an inkstand which the admiral caught up and flung after him i ll strike that rascal off the ship s books this very day  muttered admiral bell  the drunken vagabond  to pretend that i take anything when all the while it s himself well  well  i ought certainly to have suspected the quarter from whence the intelligence came  but he told it to me so circumstantially  and with such an apparent feeling of regret for the weakness into which he said you had fallen  that i really thought there might be some truth in it the rascal  i ve done with him from this moment  i have put up with too much from him for years past i think now that you have given him a great deal of liberty  and that with a great deal more he has taken  makes up an amount which you find it difficult to endure and i won t endure it let me talk to him  and i dare say i shall be able to convince him that he goes too far  and when he finds that such is the case he will mend speak to him  if you like  but i have done with such a mutinous rascal i have  you can take him into your service  if you like  till you get tired of him  and that won t be very long well  well  we shall see  jack will apologise to you i have no doubt and then i shall intercede for him  and advise you to give him another trial if you get him into the apology  then there s no doubt about me giving him another trial  but i know him too well for that  he s as obstinate as a mule  he is  and you won t get a civil word out of him  but never mind that  now  i tell you what  master charley  it will take a good lot of roast beef to get up your good looks again it will  indeed  uncle  and i require  now  rest  for i am thoroughly exhausted  the great privations i have undergone  and the amount of mental excitement which i have experienced  in consequence of the sudden and unexpected release from a fearful confinement  have greatly weakened all my energies  a few hours  sleep will make quite a different being of me well  my boy  you know best  returned the admiral  and i ll take care  if you sleep till to morrow  that you sha n t be disturbed  so now be off to bed at once the young man shook his uncle s hand in a cordial manner  and then repaired to the apartment which had been provided for him charles holland did  indeed  stand in need of repose  and for the first time now for many days he laid down with serenity at his heart  and slept for many hours  and was there not now a great and a happy change in flora bannerworth  as if by magic  in a few short hours  much of the bloom of her before fading beauty returned to her  her step again recovered its springy lightness  again she smiled upon her mother  and suffered herself to talk of a happy future  for the dread even of the vampyre s visitations had faded into comparative insignificance against the heart s deep dejection which had come over her at the thought that charles holland must surely be murdered  or he would have contrived to come to her and what a glorious recompense she had now for the trusting confidence with which she had clung to a conviction of his truth  was it not great now  to feel that when he was condemned by others  and when strong and unimpeachable evidence seemed to be against him  she had clung to him and declared her faith in his honour  and wept for him instead of condemning yes  flora  you were of that order of noble minds that  where once confidence is given  give it fully and completely  and will not harbour a suspicion of the faith of the loved one  a happy disposition when verified  as in this instance  by an answering truthfulness but when such a heart trusts not with judgment when that pure  exalted and noble confidence is given to an object unworthy of it then comes indeed  the most fearful of all mental struggles  and if the fond heart that has hugged to its inmost core so worthless a treasure  do not break in the effort to discard it  we may well be surprised at the amount of fortitude that has endured so much although the admiral had said but little concerning the fearful end marchdale had come to  it really did make some impression upon him  and much as he held in abhorrence the villany of marchdale s conduct  he would gladly in his heart have averted the fate from him that he had brought upon himself on the road to the ruins  he calculated upon taking a different kind of vengeance when they had got some distance from the cottage  admiral bell made a proposal to henry to be his second while he fought marchdale  but henry would not hear of it for a moment my dear sir  he said  could i  do you think  stand by and see a valuable  revered  and a respected life like yours exposed to any hazard merely upon the chance of punishing a villain  no  no  marchdale is too base now to be met in honourable encounter  if he is dealt with in any way let it be by the laws this was reasonable enough  and after some argument the admiral coincided in it  and then they began to wonder how  without charles they should be able to get an entrance to the dungeons  for it had been his intention originally  had he not felt so fatigued  to go with them as soon  however  as they got tolerably near to the ruins  they saw what had happened  neither spoke  but they quickened their pace  and soon stood close to the mass of stone work which now had assumed so different a shape to what it had a few short hours before it needed little examination to let them feel certain that whoever might have been in any of the underground dungeons must have been crushed to death heaven have mercy upon his soul  said henry amen  said the admiral they both turned away  and for some time they neither of them spoke  for their thoughts were full of reflection upon the horrible death which marchdale must have endured  at length the admiral said shall we tell this or not tell it at once  said henry  let us have no secrets good  then i will not make one you may depend  i only wish that while he was about it  charley could have popped that rascal varney as well in the dungeon  and then there would have been an end and a good riddance of them both chapter lxxvi the second night watch of mr  chillingworth at the hall illustration the military party in the morning left bannerworth hall  and the old place resumed its wonted quiet  but dr  chillingworth found it difficult to get rid of his old friend  the hangman  who seemed quite disposed to share his watch with him the doctor  without being at all accused of being a prejudiced man might well object to the continued companionship of one  who  according to his own account  was decidedly no better than he should be  if he were half so good moreover  it materially interfered with the proceedings of our medical friend  whose object was to watch the vampyre with all imaginable quietness and secrecy  in the event of his again visiting bannerworth hall sir  he said  to the hangman  now that you have so obligingly related to me your melancholy history  i will not detain you oh  you are not detaining me yes  but i shall probably remain here for a considerable time i have nothing to do  and one place is about the same as another to me well  then  if i must speak plainly  allow me to say  that as i came here upon a very important and special errand  i desire most particularly to be left alone  do you understand me now oh  ah i understand  you want me to go just so well  then  dr  chillingworth  allow me to tell you  i have come here on a very special errand likewise you have i have  i have been putting one circumstance to another  and drawing a variety of conclusions from a variety of facts  so that i have come to what i consider an important resolve  namely  to have a good look at bannerworth hall  and if i continue to like it as well as i do now  i should like to make the bannerworth family an offer for the purchase of it the devil you would  why all the world seems mad upon the project of buying this old building  which really is getting into such a state of dilapidation  that it cannot last many years longer it is my fancy no  no  there is something more in this than meets the eye  the same reason  be it what may  that has induced varney the vampyre to become so desirous of possessing the hall  actuates you possibly and what is that reason  you may as well be candid with me yes  i will  and am  i like the picturesque aspect of the place no  you know that that is a disingenuous answer  that you know well  it is not the aspect of the old hall that has charms for you  but i feel only from your conduct  more than ever convinced  that some plot is going on  having the accomplishment of some great object as its climax a something of which you have guessed how much you are mistaken no  i am certain i am right  and i shall immediately advise the bannerworth family to return  and to take up their abode again here  in order to put an end to the hopes which you  or varney  or any one else may have  of getting possession of the place if you were a man  said the hangman  who cared a little more for yourself  and a little less for others  i would make a confidant of you what do you mean why  i mean  candidly  that you are not selfish enough to be entitled to my confidence that is a strange reason for withholding confidence from any man it is a strange reason  but  in this case  a most abundantly true one i cannot tell you what i would tell you  because i cannot make the agreement with you that i would fain make you talk in riddles to explain which  then  would be to tell my secret dr  chillingworth was  evidently  much annoyed  and yet he was in an extremely helpless condition  for as to forcing the hangman to leave the hall  if he did not feel disposed to do so  that was completely out of the question  and could not be done  in the first place  he was a much more powerful man than the doctor  and in the second  it was quite contrary to all mr  chillingworth s habits  to engage in anything like personal warfare he could only  therefore  look his vexation  and say if you are determined upon remaining  i cannot help it  but  when some one  as there assuredly will  comes from the bannerworths  here  to me or i shall be under the necessity of stating candidly that you are intruding very good  as the morning air is keen  and as we now are not likely to be as good company to each other as we were  i shall go inside the house this was a proposition which the doctor did not like  but he was compelled to submit to it  and he saw  with feelings of uneasiness  the hangman make his way into the hall by one of the windows then dr  chillingworth sat down to think  much he wondered what could be the secret of the great desire which varney  marchdale  and even this man had  all of them to be possessors of the old hall that there was some powerful incentive he felt convinced  and he longed for some conversation with the bannerworths  or with admiral bell  in order that he might state what had now taken place  that some one would soon come to him  in order to bring fresh provisions for the day  he was certain  and all he could do  in the interim  was  to listen to what the hangman was about in the hall not a sound  for a considerable time  disturbed the intense stillness of the place  but  now  suddenly  mr  chillingworth thought he heard a hammering  as if some one was at work in one of the rooms of the hall what can be the meaning of that  he said  and he was about to proceed at once to the interior of the building  through the same window which had enabled the hangman to gain admittance  when he heard his own name pronounced by some one at the back of the garden fence  and upon casting his eyes in that direction  he  to his great relief  saw the admiral and henry bannerworth come round to the gate  said the doctor  i am more glad to see you than i can tell you just now  do not make more noise than you can help but  come round to the gate at once they obeyed the injunction with alacrity  and when the doctor had admitted them  the admiral said  eagerly you don t mean to tell us that he is here no  no  not varney  but he is not the only one who has taken a great affection for bannerworth hall  you may have another tenant for it  and i believe at any price you like to name indeed hush  creep along close to the house  and then you will not be seen there  do you hear that noise in the hall why it sounds  said the admiral  like the ship s carpenter at work it does  indeed  sound like a carpenter  it s only the new tenant making  i dare say  some repairs d n his impudence why  it certainly does look like a very cool proceeding  i must admit who  and what is he who he is now  i cannot tell you  but he was once the hangman of london  at a time when i was practising in the metropolis  and so i became acquainted with him  he knows sir francis varney  and  if i mistake not  has found out the cause of that mysterious personage s great attachment to bannerworth hall  and has found the reasons so cogent  that he has got up an affection for it himself to me  said henry  all this is as incomprehensible as anything can possibly be  what on earth does it all mean my dear henry  said the doctor  will you be ruled by me i will be ruled by any one whom i know i can trust  for i am like a man groping his way in the dark then allow this gentleman who is carpentering away so pleasantly within the house  to do so to his heart s content  but don t let him leave it show yourselves now in the garden  he has sufficient prudence to know that three constitute rather fearful odds against one  and so he will be careful  and remain where he is  if he should come out  we need not let him go until we thoroughly ascertain what he has been about you shall command the squadron  doctor  said the admiral  and have it all your own way  you know  so here goes  come along  henry  and let s show ourselves  we are both armed too they walked out into the centre of the garden  and they were soon convinced that the hangman saw them  for a face appeared at the window and was as quickly withdrawn again there  said the doctor  now he knows he is a prisoner  and we may as well place ourselves in some position which commands a good view of the house  as well as of the garden gate  and so see if we cannot starve him out  though we may be starved out ourselves not at all  said admiral bell  producing from his ample pockets various parcels we came to bring you ample supplies indeed yes  we have been as far as the ruins oh  to release marchdale  charles told me how the villain had fallen into the trap he had laid for him he has  indeed  fallen into the trap  and it s one he won t easily get out of again  he s dead dead dead yes  in the storm of last night the ruins have fallen  and he is by this time as flat as a pancake good god  and yet it is but a just retribution upon him  he would have assassinated poor charles holland in the cruelest and most cold blooded manner  and  however we may shudder at the manner of his death  we cannot regret it except that he has escaped your friend the hangman  said the admiral don t call him my friend  if you please  said dr  chillingworth  but hark how he is working away  as if he really intended to carry the house away piece by piece  as opportunity may serve  if you will not let it to him altogether  just as it stands confound him  he is evidently working on his own account  said the admiral  or he would not be half so industrious there was  indeed  a tremendous amount of hammering and noise  of one sort and another  from the house  and it was quite clear that the hangman was too heart and soul in his work  whatever may have been the object of it  to care who was listening to him  or to what conjecture he gave rise he thought probably that he could but he stopped in what he was about and  until he was so  that he might as well go on and on he went  with a vengeance  vexing the admiral terribly  who proposed so repeatedly to go into the house and insist upon knowing what he was about  that his  wishes were upon the point of being conceded to by henry  although they were combatted by the doctor  when  from the window at which he had entered  out stepped the hangman good morning  gentlemen  good morning  he said  and he moved towards the garden gate  i will not trouble you any longer  good morning not so fast  said the admiral  or we may bring you up with a round turn  and i never miss my mark when i can see it  and i shall not let it get out of sight  you may depend he drew a pistol from his pocket  as he spoke  and pointed it at the hangman  who  thereupon paused and said what  am i not to be permitted to go in peace  why it was but a short time since the doctor was quarrelling with me because i did not go  and now it seems that i am to be shot if i do yes  said the admiral  that s it well  but you dare  said he  stir another inch towards the gate  and you are a dead man the hangman hesitated a moment  and looked at admiral bell  apparently the result of the scrutiny was  that he would keep his word  for he suddenly turned and dived in at the window again without saying another word well  you have certainly stopped him from leaving  said henry  but what s to be done now let him be  let him be  said the doctor  he must come out again  for there are no provisions in the place  and he will be starved out hush  what is that  said henry there was a very gentle ring at the bell which hung over the garden gate that s an experiment  now  i ll be bound  said the doctor  to ascertain if any one is here  let us hide ourselves  and take no notice the ring in a few moments was repeated  and the three confederates hid themselves effectually behind some thick laurel bushes and awaited with expectation what might next ensue not long had they occupied their place of concealment  before they heard a heavy fall upon the gravelled pathway  immediately within the gate  as if some one had clambered to the top from the outside  and then jumped down that this was the case the sound of footsteps soon convinced them  and to their surprise as well as satisfaction  they saw through the interstices of the laurel bush behind which they were concealed  no less a personage that sir francis varney himself it is varney  said henry yes  yes  whispered the doctor  let him be  do not move for any consideration  for the first time let him do just what he likes d n the fellow  said the admiral  there are some points about him that like  after all  and he s quite an angel compared to that rascal marchdale he is he saved charles he did  and not if i know it shall any harm come to him  unless he were terribly to provoke it by becoming himself the assailant how sad he looks hush  he comes nearer  it is not safe to talk  look at him chapter lxxvii varney in the garden the communication of dr  chillingworth to the admiral and henry illustration kind reader  it was indeed varney who had clambered over the garden wall  and thus made his way into the garden of bannerworth hall  and what filled those who looked at him with the most surprise was  that he did not seem in any particular way to make a secret of his presence  but walked on with an air of boldness which either arose from a feeling of absolute impunity  from his thinking there was no one there  or from an audacity which none but he could have compassed as for the little party that was there assembled  and who looked upon him  they seemed thunderstricken by his presence  and henry  probably as well as the admiral  would have burst out into some sudden exclamation  had they not been restrained by dr  chillingworth  who suspecting that they might in some way give an alarm  hastened to speak first  saying in a whisper for heaven s sake  be still  fortune  you see  favours us most strangely  leave varney alone  you have no other mode whatever of discovering what he really wants at bannerworth hall i am glad you have spoken  said henry  as he drew a long breath  if you had not  i feel convinced that in another moment i should have rushed forward and confronted this man who has been the very bane of my life and so should i  said the admiral  although i protest against any harm being done to him  on account of some sort of good feeling that he has displayed  after all  in releasing charles from that dungeon in which marchdale has perished at the moment  said henry  i had forgotten that  but i will own that his conduct has been tinctured by a strange and wild kind of generosity at times  which would seem to bespeak  at the bottom of his heart  some good feelings  the impulses of which were only quenched by circumstances that is my firm impression of him  i can assure you  said dr chillingworth they watched varney now from the leafy covert in which they were situated  and  indeed  had they been less effectually concealed  it did not seem likely that the much dreaded vampyre would have perceived them for not only did he make no effort at concealment himself  but he took no pains to see if any one was watching him in his progress to the house his footsteps were more rapid than they usually were  and there was altogether an air and manner about him  as if he were moved to some purpose which of itself was sufficiently important to submerge in its consequences all ordinary risks and all ordinary cautions he tried several windows of the house along that terrace of which we have more than once had occasion to speak  before he found one that opened  but at length he did succeed  and stepped at once into the hall leaving those  who now for some moments in silence had regarded his movements  to lose themselves in a fearful sea of conjecture as to what could possibly be his object at all events  said the admiral  i m glad we are here  if the vampyre should have a fight with that other fellow  that we heard doing such a lot of carpentering work in the house  we ought  i think  to see fair play i  for one  said the doctor  would not like to stand by and see the vampyre murdered  but i am inclined to think he is a good match for any mortal opponent you may depend he is  said henry but how long  doctor  do you purpose that we should wait here in such a state of suspense as to what is going on within the house i hope not long  but that something will occur to make us have food for action  hark  what is that there was a loud crash within the building  as of broken glass  it sounded as if some window had been completely dashed in  but although they looked carefully over the front of the building  they could see no evidences of such a thing having happened  and were compelled consequently  to come to the opinion that varney and the other man must have met in one of the back rooms  and that the crash of glass had arisen from some personal conflict in which they had engaged i cannot stand this  said henry nay  nay  said the doctor  be still  and i will tell you something than which there can be no more fitting time than this to reveal it refers it to the vampyre it does it does be brief  then  i am in an agony of impatience it is a circumstance concerning which i can be brief  for  horrible as it is  i have no wish to dress it in any adventitious colours  sir francis varney  although under another name  is an old acquaintance of mine acquaintance  said henry why  you don t mean to say you are a vampyre  said the admiral  or that he has ever visited you no  but i knew him  from the first moment that i looked upon him in this neighbourhood  i thought i knew him  but the circumstance which induced me to think so was of so terrific a character  that i made some efforts to chase it from my mind  it has  however  grown upon me day by day  and  lately  i have had proof sufficient to convince me of his identity with one whom i first saw under most singular circumstances of romance say on you are agitated i am  indeed  this revelation has several times  within the last few days  trembled on my lips  but now you shall have it  because you ought to know all that it is possible for me to tell you of him who has caused you so serious an amount of disturbance you awaken  doctor  said henry  all my interest and mine  too  remarked the admiral  what can it be all about  and where  doctor  did you first see this varney the vampyre in his coffin both the admiral and henry gave starts of surprise as  with one accord they exclaimed did you say coffin yes  i tell you  on my word of honour  that the first time in my life i saw ever sir francis varney  was in his coffin then he is a vampyre  and there can be no mistake  said the admiral go on  i pray you  doctor  go on  said henry  anxiously i will  the reason why he became the inhabitant of a coffin was simply this he had been hanged executed at the old bailey  in london before ever i set eyes upon that strange countenance of his  you know that i was practising surgery at the london schools some years ago  and that  consequently  as i commenced the profession rather late in life  i was extremely anxious to do the most i could in a very short space of time yes yes arrived  then  with plenty of resources  which i did not  as the young men who affected to be studying in the same classes as myself  spend in the pursuit of what they considered life in london  i was indefatigable in my professional labours  and there was nothing connected with them which i did not try to accomplish at that period  the difficulty of getting a subject for anatomization was very great  and all sorts of schemes had to be put into requisition to accomplish so desirable  and  indeed  absolutely necessary a purpose i became acquainted with the man who  i have told you  is in the hall at present  and who then filled the unenviable post of public executioner  it so happened  too  that i had read a learned treatise  by a frenchman  who had made a vast number of experiments with galvanic and other apparatus  upon persons who had come to death in different ways and  in one case  he asserted that he had actually recovered a man who had been hanged  and he had lived five weeks afterwards young as i then was  in comparison to what i am now  in my profession this inflamed my imagination  and nothing seemed to me so desirable as getting hold of some one who had only recently been put to death  for the purpose of trying what i could do in the way of attempting a resuscitation of the subject  it was precisely for this reason that i sought out the public executioner  and made his acquaintance  whom every one else shunned  because i thought he might assist me by handing over to me the body of some condemned and executed man  upon whom i could try my skill i broached the subject to him  and found him not averse  he said  that if i would come forward and claim  as next of kin and allow the body to be removed to his house  the body of the criminal who was to be executed the first time  from that period  that he could give me a hint that i should have no real next of kin opponents  he would throw every facility in my way this was just what i wanted  and  i believe  i waited with impatience for some poor wretch to be hurried to his last account by the hands of my friend  the public executioner at length a circumstance occurred which favoured my designs most effectually a man was apprehended for a highway robbery of a most aggravated character  he was tried  and the evidence against him was so conclusive  that the defence which was attempted by his counsel  became a mere matter of form he was convicted  and sentenced  the judge told him not to flatter himself with the least notion that mercy would be extended to him  the crime of which he had been found guilty was on the increase it was highly necessary to make some great public example  to show evil doers that they could not  with impunity  thus trample upon the liberty of the subject  and had suddenly  just as it were  in the very nick of time committed the very crime  attended with all the aggravated circumstances which made it easy and desirable to hang him out of hand he heard his sentence  they tell me unmoved  i did not see him  but he was represented to me as a man of a strong  and well knit frame  with rather a strange  but what some would have considered a handsome expression of countenance  inasmuch as that there was an expression of much haughty resolution depicted on it i flew to my friend the executioner can you  i said  get me that man s body  who is to be hanged for the highway robbery  on monday yes  he said  i see nothing to prevent it  not one soul has offered to claim even common companionship with him far less kindred  i think if you put in your claim as a cousin  who will bear the expense of his decent burial  you will have every chance of getting possession of the body i did not hesitate  but  on the morning before the execution  i called upon one of the sheriffs i told him that the condemned man  i regretted to say  was related to me  but as i knew nothing could be done to save him on the trial  i had abstained from coming forward  but that as i did not like the idea of his being rudely interred by the authorities  i had come forward to ask for the body  after the execution should have taken place  in order that i might  at all events  bestow upon it  in some sequestered spot  a decent burial  with all the rites of the church the sheriff was a man not overburthened with penetration  he applauded my pious feelings  and actually gave me  without any inquiry  a written order to receive the body from the hands of the hangman  after it had hung the hour prescribed by the law i did not  as you may well suppose  wish to appear more in the business than was absolutely necessary  but i gave the executioner the sheriff s order for the body  and he promised that he would get a shell ready to place it in  and four stout men to carry it at once to his house  when he should cut it down good  i said  and now as i am not a little anxious for the success of my experiment  do you not think that you can manage so that the fall of the criminal shall not be so sudden as to break his neck i have thought of that  he said  and i believe that i can manage to let him down gently  so that he shall die of suffocation  instead of having his neck put out of joint  i will do my best if you can but succeed in that  said i  for i was quite in a state of mania upon the subject  i shall be much indebted to you  and will double the amount of money which i have already promised this was  as i believed it would be  a powerful stimulus to him to do all in his power to meet my wishes  and he took  no doubt  active measures to accomplish all that i desired you can imagine with what intense impatience i waited the result  he resided in an old ruinous looking house  a short distance on the surrey side of the river  and there i had arranged all my apparatus for making experiments upon the dead man  in an apartment the windows of which commanded a view of the entrance illustration i was completely ready by half past eight  although a moment s consideration of course told me that at least another hour must elapse before there could be the least chance of my seeing him arrive  for whom i so anxiously longed i can safely say so infatuated was i upon the subject  that no fond lover ever looked with more nervous anxiety for the arrival of the chosen object of his heart  than i did for that dead body  upon which i proposed to exert all the influences of professional skill  to recall back the soul to its earthly dwelling place at length i heard the sound of wheels  i found that my friend the hangman had procured a cart  in which he brought the coffin  that being a much quicker mode of conveyance than by bearers so that about a quarter past nine o clock the vehicle  with its ghastly content  stopped at the door of his house in my impatience i ran down stairs to meet that which ninety nine men out of a hundred would have gone some distance to avoid the sight of namely  a corpse  livid and fresh from the gallows  i  however  heralded it as a great gift  and already  in imagination i saw myself imitating the learned frenchman  who had published such an elaborate treatise on the mode of restoring life under all sorts of circumstances  to those who were already pronounced by unscientific persons to be dead to be sure  a sort of feeling had come over me at times  knowing as i did that the french are a nation that do not scruple at all to sacrifice truth on the altar of vanity  that it might be after all a mere rhodomontade  but  however  i could only ascertain so much by actually trying  so the suspicion that such might  by a possibility  be the end of the adventure  did not deter me i officiously assisted in having the coffin brought into the room where i had prepared everything that was necessary in the conduction of my grand experiment  and then  when no one was there with me but my friend the executioner  i  with his help  the one of us taking the head and the other the feet  took the body from the coffin and laid it upon a table hastily i placed my hand upon the region of the heart  and to my great delight i found it still warm  i drew off the cap that covered the face and then  for the first time  my eyes rested upon the countenance of him who now calls himself heaven only knows why sir francis varney good god  said henry  are you certain quite it may have been some other rascal like him  said the admiral no  i am quite sure now  i have  as i have before mentioned to you tried to get out of my own conviction upon the subject  but i have been actually assured that he is the man by the very hangman himself go on  go on  your tale certainly is a strange one  and i do not say it either to compliment you or to cast a doubt upon you  but  except from the lips of an old  and valued friend  such as you yourself are  i should not believe it i am not surprised to hear you say that  replied the doctor  nor should i be offended even now if you were to entertain a belief that i might  after all  be mistaken no  no  you would not be so positive upon the subject  i well know  if there was the slightest possibility of an error indeed i should not let us have the sequel  then it is this  i was most anxious to effect an immediate resuscitation  if it were possible  of the hanged man  a little manipulation soon convinced me that the neck was not broken  which left me at once every thing to hope for  the hangman was more prudent than i was  and before i commenced my experiments  he said doctor  have you duly considered what you mean to do with this fellow in case you should be successful in restoring him to life not i  said i well  he said  you can do as you like  but i consider that it is really worth thinking of i was headstrong on the matter  and could think of nothing but the success or the non success  in a physiological point of view  of my plan for restoring the dead to life  so i set about my experiments without any delay  and with a completeness and a vigour that promised the most completely successful results  if success could at all be an ingredient in what sober judgment would doubtless have denominated a mad headed and wild scheme for more than half an hour i tried in vain  by the assistance of the hangman  who acted under my directions  not the least symptom of vitality presented itself  and he had a smile upon his countenance  as he said in a bantering tone i am afraid  sir  it is much easier to kill than to restore their patients with doctors before i could make him any reply  for i felt that his observation had a good amount of truth in it  joined to its sarcasm the hanged man uttered a loud scream  and opened his eyes i must own i was myself rather startled  but i for some moments longer continued the same means which had produced such an effect  when suddenly he sprang up and laid hold of me  at the same time exclaiming death  death  where is the treasure i had fully succeeded too fully  and while the executioner looked on with horror depicted in his countenance  i fled from the room and the house  taking my way home as fast as i possibly could a dread came over me  that the restored man would follow me if he should find out  to whom it was he was indebted for the rather questionable boon of a new life  i packed up what articles i set the greatest store by  bade adieu to london  and never have i since set foot within that city and you never met the man you had so resuscitated not till i saw varney  the vampyre  and  as i tell you  i am now certain that he is the man that is the strangest yarn that ever i heard  said the admiral a most singular circumstance  said henry you may have noticed about his countenance  said dr  chillingworth  a strange distorted look yes  yes well  that has arisen from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles  in consequence of his having been hanged  he will never lose it  and it has not a little contributed to give him the horrible look he has  and to invest him with some of the seeming outward attributes of the vampyre and that man who is now in the hall with him  doctor  said henry  is the very hangman who executed him the same  he tells me that after i left  he paid attention to the restored man  and completed what i had nearly done  he kept him in his house for a time  and then made a bargain with him  for a large sum of money per annum  all of which he has regularly been paid  although he tells me he has no more idea where varney gets it  than the man in the moon it is very strange  but  hark  do you not hear the sound of voices in angry altercation yes  yes  they have met  let us approach the windows now  we may chance to hear something of what they say to each other chapter lxxviii the altercation between varney and the executioner in the hall the mutual agreement illustration there was certainly a loud wrangling in the hall  just as the doctor finished his most remarkable revelation concerning sir francis varney  a revelation which by no means attacked the fact of his being a vampyre or not  but rather on the contrary  had a tendency to confirm any opinion that might arise from the circumstance of his being restored to life after his execution  favourable to that belief they all three now carefully approached the windows of the hall  to listen to what was going on  and after a few moments they distinctly heard the voice of the hangman  saying in loud and rather angry accents i do not deny but that you have kept your word with me our bargain has been  as you say  a profitable one  but  still i cannot see why that circumstance should give you any sort of control over my actions but what do you here  said varney  impatiently what do you  cried the other nay  to ask another question  is not to answer mine  i tell you that i have special and most important business in this house  you can have no motive but curiosity can i not  indeed  what  too  if i have serious and important business here impossible well  i may as easily use such a term as regards what you call important business  but here i shall remain here you shall not remain and will you make the somewhat hazardous attempt to force me to leave yes  much as i dislike lifting my hand against you  i must do so  i tell you that i must be alone in this house  i have most special reasons reasons which concern my continued existence your continued existence you talk of tell me  now  how is it that you have acquired so frightful a reputation in this neighbourhood  go where i will  the theme of conversation is varney  the vampyre  and it is implicitly believed that you are one of those dreadful characters that feed upon the life blood of others  only now and then revisiting the tomb to which you ought long since to have gone in peace indeed yes  what  in the name of all that s inexplicable  has induced you to enact such a character enact it  you say  can you  then  from all you have heard of me  and from all you know of me  not conceive it possible that i am not enacting any such character  why may it not be real  look at me  do i look like one of the inhabitants of the earth in sooth  you do not and yet i am  as you see  upon it  do not  with an affected philosophy doubt all that may happen to be in any degree repugnant to your usual experiences i am not one disposed to do so  nor am i prepared to deny that such dreadful beings may exist as vampyres  however  whether or not you belong to so frightful a class of creatures  i do not intend to leave here  but  i will make an agreement with you varney was silent  and after a few moments  pause  the other exclaimed there are people  even now  watching the place  and no doubt you have been seen coming into it no  no  i was satisfied no one was here but you then you are wrong  a doctor chillingworth  of whom you know something is here  and him  you have said  you would do no harm to  even to save your life i do know him  you told me that it was to him that i was mainly indebted for my mere existence  and although i do not consider human life to be a great boon  i cannot bring myself to raise my hand against the man who  whatever might have been the motives for the deed  at all events  did snatch me from the grave upon my word  whispered the admiral  there is something about that fellow that i like  after all hush  said henry  listen to them  this would all have been unintelligible to us  if you had not related to us what you have i have just told you in time  said chillingworth  it seems will you  then  said the hangman  listen to proposals yes  said varney come along  then  and i will show you what i have been about  and i rather think you have already a shrewd guess as to my motive  this way this way they moved off to some other part of the mansion  and the sound of their voices gradually died away  so that after all  the friends had not got the least idea of what that motive was  which still induced the vampyre and the hangman  rather than leave the other on the premises  to make an agreement to stay with each other what s to be done now  said henry wait  said dr  chillingworth  wait  and watch still  i see nothing else that can be done with any degree of safety but what are we to wait for  said the admiral by waiting  we shall  perhaps  find out  was the doctor s reply  but you may depend that we never shall by interfering well  well  be it so  it seems that we have no other resource  and when either or both of those fellows make their appearance  and seem about to leave  what is to be done with them they must be seized then  and in order that that may be done without any bloodshed  we ought to have plenty of force here  henry  could you get your brother  and charles  if he be sufficiently recovered  to come certainly  and jack pringle no  said the admiral  no jack pringle for me  i have done with him completely  and i have made up my mind to strike him off the ship s books  and have nothing more to do with him well  well  added the doctor  we will not have him  then  and it is just as well  for  in all likelihood  he would come drunk  and we shall be let me see five strong without him  which ought to be enough to take prisoners two men yes  said henry  although one of them may be a vampyre that makes no difference  said the admiral  i d as soon take a ship manned with vampyres as with frenchmen henry started off upon his errand  certainly leaving the admiral and the doctor in rather a critical situation while he was gone  for had varney the vampyre and the hangman chosen  they could certainly easily have overcome so inefficient a force the admiral would  of course  have fought  and so might the doctor  as far as his hands would permit him  but if the others had really been intent upon mischief  they could  from their downright superior physical power  have taken the lives of the two that were opposed to them but somehow the doctor appeared to have a great confidence in the affair  whether that confidence arose from what the vampyre had said with regard to him  or from any hidden conviction of his own that they would not yet emerge from the hall  we cannot say  but certain it is  he waited the course of events with great coolness no noise for some time came from the house  but then the sounds  as if workmen were busy within it  were suddenly resumed  and with more vigour than before it was nearly two hours before henry made the private signal which had been agreed upon as that which should proclaim his return  and then he and his brother  with charles  who  when he heard of the matter  would notwithstanding the persuasions of flora to the contrary  come  got quietly over the fence at a part of the garden which was quite hidden from the house by abundant vegetation  and the whole three of them took up a position that tolerably well commanded a view of the house  while they were themselves extremely well hidden behind a dense mass of evergreens did you see that rascal  jack pringle  said the admiral yes  said henry  he is drunk ah  to be sure and we had no little difficulty in shaking him off  he suspected where we were going  but i think  by being peremptory  we got fairly rid of him the vagabond  if he comes here  i ll brain him  i will  the swab  why lately he s done nothing but drink  that s the way with him  he ll go on sometimes for a year and more  and not take more than enough to do him good  and then all at once  for about six or eight weeks  he does nothing but drink well  well  we can do without him  said henry without him  i should think so  do you hear those fellows in the hall at work  d n me  if i haven t all of a sudden thought what the reason of it all is what what  said the doctor  anxiously why  that rascal varney  you know  had his house burnt down yes  well yes  well  i dare say he didn t think it well  but  however  he no doubt wants another  so  you see  my idea is  that he s stealing the material from bannerworth hall oh  is that your notion yes  and a very natural one  i think  too  master doctor  whatever you may think of it  come  now  have you a better oh  dear  no  certainly not  but i have a notion that something to eat would comfort the inward man much and so would something to drink  blow me if it wouldn t  said jack pringle  suddenly making his appearance the admiral made a rush upon him  but he was restrained by the others and jack  with a look of triumph  said why  what s amiss with you now  i ain t drunk now  come  come  you have something dangerous in the wind  i know  so i ve made up my mind to be in it  so don t put yourself out of the way  if you think i don t know all about it  you are mistaken  for i do  the vampyre is in the house yonder  and i m the fellow to tackle him  i believe you  my boys good god  said the doctor  what shall we do nothing  said jack  as he took a bottle from his pocket and applied the neck of it to his lips nothing nothing at all there s something to begin with  said the admiral  as with his stick he gave the bottle a sudden blow that broke it and spilt all its contents  leaving jack petrified  with the bit of the neck of it still in his mouth my eye  admiral  he said  was that done like a british seaman  my eye was that the trick of a lubber  or of a thorough going first rater first rater  my eye hold your noise  will you  you are not drunk yet  and i was determined that you should not get so  which you soon would with that rum bottle if i had not come with a broadside across it  now you may stay  but mark me  you are on active service now  and must do nothing without orders ay  ay  your honour  said jack  as he dropped the neck of the bottle and looked ruefully upon the ground  from whence arose the aroma of rum ay  ay  but it s a hard case  take it how you will  to have your grog stopped  but  d n it  i never had it stopped yet when it was in my mouth henry and charles could not forbear a smile at jack s discomfiture which  however  they were very glad of  for they knew full well his failing  and that in the course of another half hour he would have been drunk  and incapable of being controlled  except  as on some former occasions  by the exercise of brute force but jack was evidently displeased  and considered himself to be grievously insulted  which  after all  was the better  inasmuch as while he was brooding over his wrongs  he was quiet  when  otherwise  it might have been a very difficult matter to make him so they partook of some refreshments  and  as the day advanced  the brothers bannerworth  as well as charles holland  began to get very anxious upon the subject of the proceedings of sir francis varney in the hall they conversed in low tones  exhausting every  as they considered possible conjecture to endeavour to account for his mysterious predilection for that abode  but nothing occurred to them of a sufficiently probable motive to induce them to adopt it as a conclusion they more than suspected dr  chillingworth  because he was so silent and hazarded no conjecture at all of knowing something  or of having formed to himself some highly probable hypothesis upon the subject  but they could not get him to agree that such was the case when they challenged him upon the subject  all he would say was my good friends  you perceive that  there is a great mystery somewhere and i do hope that to night it will be cleared up satisfactorily with this they were compelled to be satisfied  and now the soft and sombre shades of evening began to creep over the scene  enveloping all objects in the dimness and repose of early night the noise from the house had ceased  and all was profoundly still  but more than once henry fancied he heard footsteps outside the garden he mentioned his suspicions to charles holland  who immediately said the same thing has come to my ears indeed  then it must be so  we cannot both of us have merely imagined such a thing  you may depend that this place is beleaguered in some way and that to night will be productive of events which will throw a great light upon the affairs connected with this vampyre that have hitherto baffled conjecture hush  said charles  there  again  i am quite confident i heard a sound as of a broken twig outside the garden wall  the doctor and the admiral are in deep discussion about something shall we tell them no  let us listen  as yet they bent all their attention to listening  inclining their ears towards the ground  and  after a few moments  they felt confident that more than one footstep was creeping along  as cautiously as possible  under the garden wall  after a few moments  consultation  henry made up his mind he being the best acquainted with the localities of the place to go and reconnoitre  so he  without saying anything to the doctor or the admiral  glided from where he was  in the direction of a part of the fence which he knew he could easily scale chapter lxxix the vampyre s danger the last refuge the ruse of henry bannerworth illustration yet knowing to what deeds of violence the passions of a lawless mob will sometimes lead them  and having the experience of what had been attempted by the alarmed and infuriated populace on a former occasion against the hall  henry bannerworth was  reasonably enough  not without his fears that something might occur of a nature yet highly dangerous to the stability of his ancient house he did not actually surmount the fence  but he crept so close to it that he could get over in a moment  if he wished  and  if any one should move or speak on the other side  he should be quite certain to hear them for a few moments all was still  and then suddenly he heard some one say  in a low voice hist  hist  did you hear nothing i thought i did  said another  but i now am doubtful listen again what  thought henry  can be the motives of these men lying secreted here  it is most extraordinary what they can possibly want  unless they are brewing danger for the hall most cautiously now he raised himself  so that his eyes could just look over the fence  and then  indeed  he was astonished he had expected to see two or three persons  at the utmost  what was his surprise  to find a compact mass of men crouching down under the garden wall  as far as his eye could reach for a few moments  he was so surprised  that he continued to gaze on heedless of the danger there might be from a discovery that he was playing the part of a spy upon them when  however  his first sensations of surprise were over  he cautiously removed to his former position  and  just as he did  so  he heard those who had before spoken  again  in low tones  breaking the stillness of the night i am resolved upon it  said one  i am quite determined  i will please god  rid the country of that dreadful man don t call him a man  said the oilier well  well  it is a wrong name to apply to a vampyre it is varney  after all  then  said henry  bannerworth  to himself it is his life that they seek  what can be done to save him for saved he shall be if i can compass such an object  i feel that there is yet a something in his character which is entitled to consideration  and he shall not be savagely murdered while i have an arm to raise in his defence  but if anything is now to be done  it must be done by stratagem  for the enemy are  by far  in too great force to be personally combatted with henry resolved to take the advice of his friends  and with that view he went silently and quietly back to where they were  and communicated to them the news that he had so unexpectedly discovered they were all much surprised  and then the doctor said you may depend  that since the disappointment of the mob in the destruction of this place  they have had their eye upon varney  he has been dogged here by some one  and then by degrees that assemblage has sought the spot he s a doomed man  then  remarked the admiral  for what can save him from a determined number of persons  who  by main force  will overcome us  let us make what stand we may in his defence is there no hiding place in the house  said charles  where you might after warning him of his danger  conceal him there are plenty  but of what avail would that be  if they burn down the hall  which in all probability they will none  certainly there is but one chance  said henry  and that is to throw them off the scent  and induce them to think that he whom they seek is not here i think that may possibly be done by boldness but how i will go among them and make the effort he at once left the friends  for he felt that there might be no time to lose  and hastening to the same part of the wall  over which he had looked so short a time before  he clambered over it  and cried  in a loud voice stop the vampyre  stop the vampyre where  where  shouted a number of persons at once  turning their eyes eagerly towards the spot where henry stood there  across the fields  cried henry  i have lain in wait for him long  but he has eluded me  and is making his way again towards the old ruins  where i am sure he has some hiding place that he thinks will elude all search  there  i see his dusky form speeding onwards come on  cried several  to the ruins  to the ruins  we ll smoke him out if he will not come by fair means  we must have him  dead or alive yes  to the ruins  shouted the throng of persons  who up to this time had preserved so cautious a silence  and  in a few moments more  henry bannerworth had the satisfaction of finding that his ruse had been perfectly successful  for bannerworth hall and its vicinity were completely deserted  and the mob  in a straggling mass  went over hedge and ditch towards those ruins in which there was nothing to reward the exertions they might choose to make in the way of an exploration of them  but the dead body of the villain marchdale  who had come there to so dreadful  but so deserved a death chapter lxxx the discovery of the body of marchdale in the ruins by the mob the burning of the corpse the murder of the hangman illustration the mob reached the ruins of bannerworth hall  and crowded round it on all sides  with the view of ascertaining if a human creature  dead or alive  were there  various surmises were afloat  and some were for considering that everybody but themselves  or their friends  must be nothing less than vampyres  indeed  a strange man  suddenly appearing among them  would have caused a sensation  and a ring would no doubt have been formed round him  and then a hasty council held  or  what was more probable  some shout  or word uttered by some one behind  who could not understand what was going on in front  would have determined them to commit some desperate outrage  and the sacrifice of life would have been the inevitable result of such an unfortunate concurrence of circumstances there was a pause before anyone ventured among the ruins  the walls were carefully looked to  and in more than one instance  but they were found dangerous  what were remaining  some parts had been so completely destroyed  that there were nothing but heaps of rubbish however  curiosity was exerted to such an extraordinary pitch that it overcame the fear of danger  in search of the horrible  for they believed that if there were any one in the ruins he must be a vampyre of course  and they were somewhat cautious in going near such a creature  lest in so doing they should meet with some accident  and become vampyres too this was a dreadful reflection  and one that every now and then impressed itself upon the individuals composing the mob  but at the same time any new impulse  or a shout  and they immediately became insensible to all fear  the mere impulse is the dominant one  and then all is forgotten the scene was an impressive one  the beautiful house and grounds looked desolate and drear  many of the trees were stripped and broken down  and many scorched and burned  while the gardens and flower beds  the delight of the bannerworth family  were rudely trodden under foot by the rabble and all those little beauties so much admired and tended by the inhabitants  were now utterly destroyed  and in such a state that their site could not even be detected by the former owners it was a sad sight to see such a sacrilege committed such violence done to private feelings  as to have all these places thrown open to the scrutiny of the brutal and vulgar  who are incapable of appreciating or understanding the pleasures of a refined taste the ruins presented a remarkable contrast to what the place had been but a very short time before  and now the scene of desolation was complete there was no one spot in which the most wretched could find shelter to be sure  under the lee of some broken and crumbling wall  that tottered  rather than stood  a huddled wretch might have found shelter from the wind  but it would have been at the risk of his life  and not there complete the mob became quiet for some moments  but was not so long  indeed  a mob of people which is  in fact  always composed of the most disorderly characters to be found in a place  is not exactly the assembly that is most calculated for quietness  somebody gave a shout and then somebody else shouted  and the one wide throat of the whole concourse was opened  and sent forth a mighty yell after this exhibition of power  they began to run about like mad traverse the grounds from one end to the other  and then the ruins were in progress of being explored this was a tender affair  and had to be done with some care and caution by those who were so engaged  and they walked over crumbling and decayed masses in one or two places  they saw what appeared to be large holes  into which the building materials had been sunk  by their own weight  through the flooring  that seemed as roofs to some cellars or dungeons seeing this  they knew not how soon some other part might sink in  and carry their precious bodies down with the mass of rubbish  this gave an interest to the scene a little danger is a sort of salt to an adventure  and enables those who have taken part in it to talk of their exploits  and of their dangers  which is pleasant to do  and to hear in the ale house  and by the inglenook in the winter however  when a few had gone some distance  others followed  when they saw them enter the place in safety  and at length the whole ruins were covered with living men  and not a few women  who seemed necessary to make up the elements of mischief in this case there were some shouting and hallooing from one to the other as they hurried about the ruins at length they had explored the ruins nearly all over  when one man  who had stood a few minutes upon a spot  gazing intently upon something suddenly exclaimed hilloa  hurrah  here we are  altogether come on i ve found him i ve found recollect it s me  and nobody else has found hurrah then  with a wild kind of frenzy  he threw his hat up into the air  as if to attract attention  and call others round him  to see what it was he had found what s the matter  bill  exclaimed one who came up to him  and who had been close at hand the matter  why  i ve found him  that s the matter  old man  replied the first what  a whale no  a wampyre  the blessed wampyre  there he is don t you see him under them ere bricks oh  that s not him  he got away i don t care  replied the other  who got away  or who didn t  i know this much  that he s a wampyre he wouldn t be there if he warn t this was an unanswerable argument  and nobody could deny it consequently  there was a cessation of talk  and the people then came up  as the two first were looking at the body whose is it  inquired a dozen voices illustration not sir francis varney s  said the second speaker  the clothes are not his no  no  not sir francis s but i tell you what  mates  said the first speaker  that if it isn t sir francis varney s  it is somebody else s as bad  i dare say  now he s a wictim a what a wictim to the wampyre  and  if he sees the blessed moonlight  he will be a wampyre hisself  and so shall we be  too  if he puts his teeth into us so we shall so we shall  said the mob  and their flesh begin to run cold  and there was a feeling of horror creeping over the whole body of persons within hearing i tell you what it is  our only plan will be to get him out of the ruins  then  remarked another what  said one  who s going to handle such cattle  if you ve a sore about you  and his blood touches you  who s to say you won t be a vampyre  too no  no you won t  said an old woman i won t try  was the happy rejoinder  i ain t a going to carry a wampyre on my two legs home to my wife and small family of seven children  and another a coming there was a pause for a few moments  and then one man more adventurous than the rest  exclaimed well  vampyre  or no vampyre  his dead body can harm no one  so here goes to get it out  help me who will  once have it out  and then we can prevent any evil  by burning it  and thus destroying the whole body hurrah  shouted three or four more  as they jumped down into the hole formed by the falling in of the materials which had crushed marchdale to death  for it was his body they had discovered they immediately set to work to displace such of the materials as lay on the body  and then  having cleared it of all superincumbent rubbish they proceeded to lift it up  but found that it had got entangled  as they called it  with some chains  with some trouble they got them off and the body was lifted out to a higher spot now  what s to be done  inquired one burn it  said another hurrah  shouted a female voice  we ve got the wampyre  run a stake through his body  and then place him upon some dry wood there s plenty to be had about here  i am sure and then burn him to a cinder that s right  old woman that s right  said a man  nothing better the devil must be in him if he come to life after that  i should say there might be something in that  and the mob shouted its approbation as it was sure to do as anything stupid or senseless  and the proposal might be said to have been carried by acclamation  and it required only the execution this was soon done  there were plenty of laths and rafters  and the adjoining wood furnished an abundant supply of dry sticks  so there was no want of fuel there was a loud shout as each accession of sticks took place  and  as each individual threw his bundle into the heap  each man felt all the self devotion to the task as the scottish chieftain who sacrificed himself and seven sons in the battle for his superior  and  when one son was cut down  the man filled up his place with the exclamation another for hector  until he himself fell as the last of his race soon now the heap became prodigious  and it required an effort to get the mangled corpse upon this funeral bier  but it was then a shout from the mob that rent the air announced  both the fact and their satisfaction the next thing to be done was to light the pile this was no easy task but like all others  it was accomplished  and the dead body of the vampyre s victim was thrown on to prevent that becoming a vampyre too in its turn there  boys  said one  he ll not see the moonlight  that s certain and the sooner we put a light to this the better  for it may be  the soldiers will be down upon us before we know anything of it  so now who s got a light this was a question that required a deal of searching  but  at length one was found by one of the mob coming forward  and after drawing his pipe vigorously for some moments  he collected some scraps of paper upon which he emptied the contents of the pipe  with the hope they would take fire in this  however  he was doomed to disappointment  for it produced nothing but a deal of smoke  and the paper burned without producing any flame this act of disinterestedness  however was not without its due consequences  for there were several who had pipes  and  fired with the hope of emulating the first projector of the scheme for raising the flame  they joined together  and potting the contents of their pipes together on some paper  straw  and chips  they produced  after some little trouble  a flame then there was a shout  and the burning mass was then placed in a favourable position nearer the pile of materials collected for burning and then  in a few moments  it began to take light  one piece communicated the fire to another  until the whole was in a blaze when the first flame fairly reached the top  a loud and tremendous shout arose from the mob  and the very welkin re echoed with its fulness then the forked flames rushed through the wood  and hissed and crackled as they flew  throwing up huge masses of black smoke  and casting a peculiar reflection around  not a sound was heard save the hissing and roaring of the flames  which seemed like the approaching of a furious whirlwind at length there was nothing to be seen but the blackened mass  it was enveloped in one huge flame  that threw out a great heat  so much so that those nearest to it felt induced to retire from before it i reckon  said one  that he s pretty well done by this time he s had a warm berth of it up there yes  said another  farmer walkings s sheep he roasted whole at last harvest home hadn t such a fire as this  i ll warrant  there s no such fire in the county why  it would prevent a frost  i do believe it would so it would  neighbour  answered another yes  replied a third  but you d want such a one corner of each field though                                    there was much talk and joking going on among the men who stood around in the midst of which  however  they were disturbed by a loud shout  and upon looking in the quarter whence it came  they saw stealing from among the ruins  the form of a man he was a strange  odd looking man  and at the time it was very doubtful among the mob as to whom it was nobody could tell  and more than one looked at the burning pile  and then at the man who seemed to be so mysteriously present  as if they almost imagined that the body had got away who is it  exclaimed one danged if i knows  said another  looking very hard  and very white at the same time i hope it ain t the chap what we ve burned here jist now no  said the female  that you may be sure of  for he s had a stake through his body  and as you said  he can never get over that  for as the stake is consumed  so are his vitals  and that s a sure sign he s done for yes  yes  she s right a vampyre may live upon blood  but cannot do without his inside this was so obvious to them all  that it was at once conceded  and a general impression pervaded the mob that it might be sir francis varney a shout ensued hurrah after him there s a vampyre there he goes after him catch him burn him and a variety of other exclamations were uttered  at the same time  the victim of popular wrath seemed to be aware that he was now discovered and made off with all possible expedition  towards some wood away went the mob in pursuit  hooting and hallooing like demons  and denouncing the unfortunate being with all the terrors that could be imagined  and which naturally added greater speed to the unfortunate man however  some among the mob  seeing that there was every probability of the stranger s escaping at a mere match of speed  brought a little cunning to bear upon matter  and took a circuit round  and thus intercepted him this was not accomplished without a desperate effort  and by the best runners  who thus reached the spot he made for  before he could get there when the stranger saw himself thus intercepted  he endeavoured to fly in a different direction  but was soon secured by the mob  who made somewhat free with his person  and commenced knocking him about have mercy on me  said the stranger  what do you want  i am not rich but take all i have what do you do here  inquired twenty voices  come  tell us that what do you do here  and who are you a stranger  quite a stranger to these parts oh  yes  he s a stranger  but that s all the worse for him he s a vampyre there s no doubt about that good god  said the man  i am a living and breathing man like yourselves  i have done no wrong  and injured no man be merciful unto me  i intend no harm of course not  send him to the fire take him back to the ruins to the fire ay  and run a stake through his body  and then he s safe for life  i am sure he has something to do with the vampyre  and who knows  if he ain t a vampyre  how soon he may become one ah  that s very true  bring him back to the fire  and we ll try the effects of the fire upon his constitution i tell you what  neighbour  it s my opinion  that as one fool makes many  so one vampyre makes many so it does  so it does  there s much truth and reason in that neighbour  i am decidedly of that opinion  too come along then  cried the mob  cuffing and pulling the unfortunate stranger with them mercy  mercy but it was useless to call for mercy to men whose superstitious feelings urged them on  for when the demon of superstition is active  no matter what form it may take  it always results in cruelty and wickedness to all various were the shouts and menaces of the mob  and the stranger saw no hope of life unless he could escape from the hands of the people who surrounded him they had now nearly reached the ruins  and the stranger  who was certainly a somewhat odd and remarkable looking man  and who appeared in their eyes the very impersonation of their notions of a vampyre  was thrust from one to the other  kicked by one  and then cuffed by the other  as if he was doomed to run the gauntlet down with the vampyre  said the mob i am no vampyre  said the stranger  i am new to these parts  and i pray you have mercy upon me  i have done you no wrong  hear me i know nothing of these people of whom you speak that won t do  you ve come here to see what you can do  i dare say and  though you may have been hurt by the vampyre  and may be only your misfortune  and not your fault  yet the mischief is as great as ever it was or can be  you become  in spite of yourself  a vampyre  and do the same injury to others that has been done to you there s no help for you no help we can t help it  shouted the mob  he must die throw him on the pile put a stake through him first  though  exclaimed the humane female put a stake through him  and then he s safe this horrible advice had an electric effect on the stranger  who jumped up  and eluded the grasp of several hands that were stretched forth to seize him throw him upon the burning wood  shouted one and a stake through his body  suggested the humane female again  who seemed to have this one idea in her heart  and no other  and  upon every available opportunity  she seemed to be anxious to give utterance to the comfortable notion seize him  exclaimed one never let him go  said another  we ve gone too far to hang back now and  if he escape  he will visit us in our sleep  were it only out of spite the stranger made a dash among the ruins  and  for a moment out stripped his pursuers  but a few  more adventurous than the rest succeeded in driving him into an angle formed by two walls  and the consequence was  he was compelled to come to a stand seize him seize him  exclaimed all those at a distance the stranger  seeing he was now nearly surrounded  and had no chance of escape  save by some great effort  seized a long piece of wood  and struck two of his assailants down at once  and then dashed through the opening he immediately made for another part of the ruins  and succeeded in making his escape for some short distance  but was unable to keep up the speed that was required  for his great exertion before had nearly exhausted him  and the fear of a cruel death before his eyes was not enough to give him strength  or lend speed to his flight  he had suffered too much from violence  and  though he ran with great speed yet those who followed were uninjured  and fresher he had no chance they came very close upon him at the corner of a field  which he endeavoured to cross  and had succeeded in doing  and he made a desperate attempt to scramble up the bank that divided the field from the next  but he slipped back  almost exhausted  into the ditch  and the whole mob came up however  he got on the bank  and leaped into the next field  and then he was immediately surrounded by those who pursued him  and he was struck down down with the vampyre kill him he s one of em run a stake through him  were a few of the cries of the infuriated mob of people who were only infuriated because he attempted to escape their murderous intentions it was strange to see how they collected in a ring as the unfortunate man lay on the ground  panting for breath  and hardly able to speak their infuriated countenances plainly showing the mischief they were intent upon have mercy upon me  he exclaimed  as he lay on the earth  i have no power to help myself the mob returned no answer  but stood collecting their numbers as they came up have mercy on me  it cannot be any pleasure to you to spill my blood  i am unable to resist i am one man among many you surely cannot wish to beat me to death we want to hurt no one  except in our own defence  and we won t be made vampyres of because you don t like to die no  no  we won t be vampyres  exclaimed the mob  and there arose a great shout from the mob are you men fathers have you families  if so  i have the same ties as you have  spare me for their sakes do not murder me you will leave one an orphan if you do  besides  what have i done  i have injured no one i tell you what  friends  if we listen to him we shall all be vampyres and all our children will all be vampyres and orphans so we shall  so we shall  down with him the man attempted to get up  but  in doing so  he received a heavy blow from a hedge stake  wielded by the herculean arm of a peasant  the sound of the blow was heard by those immediately around  and the man fell dead  there was a pause  and those nearest  apparently fearful of the consequences  and hardly expecting the catastrophe  began to disperse and the remainder did so very soon afterwards chapter lxxxi the vampyre s flight his danger  and the last place of refuge illustration leaving the disorderly and vicious mob  who were thus sacrificing human life to their excited passions  we return to the brothers bannerworth and the doctor  who together with admiral bell  still held watch over the hall no indication of the coming forth of varney presented itself for some time longer  and then  at least they thought  they heard a window open and  turning their eyes in the direction whence the sound proceeded they could see the form of a man slowly and cautiously emerging from it as far as they could judge  from the distance at which they were  that form partook much of the appearance and the general aspect of sir francis varney  and the more they looked and noticed its movements  the more they felt convinced that such was the fact there comes your patient  doctor  said the admiral don t call him my patient  said the doctor  if you please why you know he is  and you are  in a manner of speaking  bound to look after him  well  what is to be done he must not  on any account  said dr  chillingworth  be allowed to leave the place  believe me  i have the very strongest reasons for saying so he shall not leave it then  said henry even as he spoke  henry bannerworth darted forward  and sir francis varney dropped from the window  out of which he had clambered  close to his feet hold  cried henry  you are my prisoner with the most imperturbable coolness in the world  sir francis varney turned upon him  and replied and pray  henry bannerworth  what have i done to provoke your wrath what have you done have you not  like a thief  broken into my house can you ask what you have done ay  said the vampyre  like a thief  perchance  and yet no thief  may i ask you  what there is to steal  in the house by the time this short dialogue had been uttered  the rest of the party had come up  and varney was  so far as regarded numbers  a prisoner well  gentlemen  he said  with that strange contortion of countenance which  now they all understood  arose from the fact of his having been hanged  and restored to life again  well  gentlemen  now that you have beleaguered me in such a way  may i ask you what it is about if you will step aside with me  sir francis varney  for a moment  said dr  chillingworth  i will make to you a communication which will enable you to know what it is all about oh  with pleasure  said the vampyre  i am not ill at present  but still  sir  i have no objection to hear what you have to say he stepped a few paces on one side with the doctor  while the others waited  not without some amount of impatience for the result of the communication  all that they could hear was  that varney said suddenly you are quite mistaken and then the doctor appeared to be insisting upon something  which the vampyre listened to patiently  and  at the end  burst out with why  doctor  you must be dreaming at this  dr  chillingworth at once left him  and advancing to his friends  he said sir francis varney denies in toto all that i have related to you concerning him  therefore  i can say no more than that i earnestly recommend you  before you let him go  to see that he takes nothing of value with him why  what can you mean  said varney search him  said the doctor  i will tell you why  very shortly indeed indeed  said sir francis varney  now  gentlemen  i will give you a chance of behaving justly and quietly  so saving yourself the danger of acting otherwise  i have made repeated offers to take this house  either as a tenant or as a purchaser  all of which offers have been declined  upon  i dare say  a common enough principle  namely  one which induces people to enhance the value of anything they have for disposal  if it be unique  by making it difficult to come at  seeing that you had deserted the place  i could make no doubt but that it was to be had  so i came here to make a thorough examination of its interior  to see if it would suit me  i find that it will not therefore  i have only to apologise for the intrusion  and to wish you a remarkably good evening that won t do  said the doctor what won t do  sir this excuse will not do  sir francis varney  you are  although you deny it  the man who was hanged in london some years ago for a highway robbery varney laughed  and held up his hands  exclaiming alas  alas  our good friend  the doctor  has studied too hard  his wits  probably  at the best of times  none of the clearest  have become hopelessly entangled do you deny  said henry  then  that you are that man most unequivocally i assert it  said the doctor  and now  i will tell you all  for i perceive you hesitate about searching  sir francis varney  i tell you all why it is that he has such an affection for bannerworth hall before you do  said varney  there is a pill for you  which you may find more nauseous and harder of digestion  than any your shop can furnish as varney uttered these words  he suddenly drew from his pocket a pistol  and  levelling it at the unfortunate doctor  he fired it full at him the act was so sudden  so utterly unexpected  and so stunning  that it was done before any one could move hand or foot to prevent it  henry bannerworth and his brother were the furthest off from the vampyre  and unhappily  in the rush which they  as soon us possible  made towards him  they knocked down the admiral  who impeded them much  and  before they could spring over  or past him  sir francis varney was gone so sudden  too  had been his departure  that they had not the least idea in which direction he had gone  so that to follow him would have been a work of the greatest possible difficulty notwithstanding  however  both the difficulty and the danger  for no doubt the vampyre was well enough armed  henry and his brother both rushed after the murderer  as they now believed him to be  in the route which they thought it was most probable he would take  namely  that which led towards the garden gate they reached that spot in a few moments  but all was profoundly still not the least trace of any one could be seen  high or low  and they were compelled  after a cursory examination  to admit that sir francis varney had again made his escape  despite the great odds that were against him in point of numbers he has gone  said henry  let us go back  and see into the state of poor dr  chillingworth  who  i fear  is a dead man they hurried back to the spot  and there they found the admiral looking as composed as possible  and solacing himself with a pinch of snuff  as he gazed upon the apparently lifeless form at his feet is he dead  said henry i should say he was  replied the admiral  such a shot as that was don t want to be repeated  well  i liked the doctor with all his faults he only had one foolish way with him  and that was  that he shirked his grog this is an awful catastrophe  said henry  as he knelt down by the side of the body  assist me  some of you  where is charles i ll be hanged  said the admiral  if i know  he disappeared somewhere this is a night of mystery as well as terror  alas  poor dr chillingworth  i little thought that you would have fallen a victim to the man whom you preserved from death  how strange it is that you should have snatched from the tomb the very individual who was  eventually  to take your own life the brothers gently raised the body of the doctor  and carried it on to the glass plot  which was close at hand farewell  kind and honest hearted chillingworth  said henry  i shall many and many a time  feel your loss  and now i will rest not until i have delivered up to justice your murderer  all consideration  or feeling  for what seemed to be latent virtues in that strange and inexplicable man  varney  shall vanish  and he shall reap the consequences of the crime he has now committed it was a cold blooded  cowardly murder  said his brother it was  but you may depend the doctor was about to reveal something to us  which varney so much dreaded  that he took his life as the only effectual way  at the moment  of stopping him it must be so  said henry and now  said the admiral  it s too late  and we shall not know it at all  that s the way  a fellow saves up what he has got to tell till it is too late to tell it  and down he goes to davy jones s locker with all his secrets aboard not always  said dr  chillingworth  suddenly sitting bolt upright not always henry and his brother started back in amazement  and the admiral was so taken by surprise  that had not the resuscitated doctor suddenly stretched out his hand and laid hold of him by the ankle  he would have made a precipitate retreat hilloa  murder  he cried  let me go  how do i know but you may be a vampyre by now  as you were shot by one henry soonest recovered from the surprise of the moment  and with the most unfeigned satisfaction  he cried thank god you are unhurt  dr  chillingworth  why he must have missed you by a miracle not at all  said the doctor  help me up thank you all right  i m only a little singed about the whiskers  he hit me safe enough then how have you escaped why from the want of a bullet in the pistol  to be sure  i can understand it all well enough  he wanted to create sufficient confusion to cover a desperate attempt to escape  and he thought that would be best done by seeming so shoot me  the suddenness of the shock  and the full belief  at the moment  that he had sent a bullet into my brains made me fall  and produced a temporary confusion of ideas  amounting to insensibility from which you are happily recovered  thank heaven that  after all  he is not such a villain as this act would have made him ah  said the admiral  it takes people who have lived a little in these affairs to know the difference in sound between a firearm with a bullet in it  and one without  i knew it was all right then why did you not say so  admiral what was the use  i thought the doctor might be amused to know what you should say of him  so you see i didn t interfere  and  as i am not a good hand at galloping after anybody  i didn t try that part of the business  but just remained where i was alas  alas  cried the doctor  i much fear that  by his going  i have lost all that i expected to be able to do for you  henry  it s of not the least use now telling you or troubling you about it  you may now sell or let bannerworth hall to whomever you please  for i am afraid it is really worthless what on earth do you mean  said henry  why  doctor  will you keep up this mystery among us  if you have anything to say  why not say it at once because  i tell you it s of no use now  the game is up  sir francis varney has escaped  but still i don t know that i need exactly hesitate there can be no reason for your hesitating about making a communication to us  said henry  it is unfriendly not to do so my dear boy  you will excuse me for saying that you don t know what you are talking about can you give any reason yes  respect for the living  i should have to relate something of the dead which would be hurtful to their feelings henry was silent for a few moments  and then he said what dead  and who are the living another time  whispered the doctor to him  another time  henry  do not press me now  but you shall know all another time i must be content  but now let us remember that another man yet lingers in bannerworth hall  i will endure suspense on his account no longer  he is an intruder there  so i go at once to dislodge him no one made any opposition to this move  not even the doctor  so henry preceded them all to the house  they passed through the open window into the long hall  and from thence into every apartment of the mansion without finding the object of their search  but from one of the windows up to which there grew great masses of ivy  there hung a rope  by which any one might easily have let himself down  and no doubt  therefore existed in all their minds that the hangman had sufficiently profited by the confusion incidental to the supposed shooting of the doctor  to make good his escape from the place and so  after all  said henry  we are completely foiled we may be  said dr  chillingworth  but it is  perhaps  going too far to say that we actually are  one thing  however  is quite clear  and that is  no good can be done here then let us go home  said the admiral  i did not think from the first that any good would be done here they all left the garden together now  so that almost for the first time  bannerworth hall was left to itself  unguarded and unwatched by any one whatever  it was with an evident and a marked melancholy that the doctor proceeded with the party to the cottage house of the bannerworths  but  as after what he had said  henry forbore to question him further upon those subjects which he admitted he was keeping secret and as none of the party were much in a cue for general conversation the whole of them walked on with more silence than usually characterised them chapter lxxxii charles holland s pursuit of the vampyre the dangerous interview illustration it will be recollected that the admiral had made a remark about charles holland having suddenly disappeared  and it is for us now to account for that disappearance and to follow him to the pathway he had chosen the fact was  that he  when varney fired the shot at the doctor  or what was the supposed shot  was the farthest from the vampyre  and he  on that very account  had the clearest and best opportunity of marking which route he took when he had discharged the pistol he was not confused by the smoke  as the others were  nor was he stunned by the noise of the discharge  but he distinctly saw varney dart across one of the garden beds  and make for the summer house  instead of for the garden gate  as henry had supposed was the most probable path he had chosen now  charles holland either had an inclination  for some reasons of his own  to follow the vampyre alone  or  on the spur of the moment  he had not time to give an alarm to the others  but certain it is that he did unaided  rush after him  he saw him enter the summer house  and pass out of it again at the back portion of it  as he had once before done  when surprised in his interview with flora but the vampyre did not now  as he had done on the former occasion  hide immediately behind the summer house  he seemed to be well aware that that expedient would not answer twice  so he at once sped onwards clearing the garden fence  and taking to the meadows it formed evidently no part of the intentions of charles holland to come up with him  he was resolved upon dogging his footsteps  to know where he should go  so that he might have a knowledge of his hiding place  if he had one i must and will  said charles to himself  penetrate the mystery that hangs about this most strange and inexplicable being  i will have an interview with him  not in hostility  for i forgive him the evil he has done me  but with a kindly spirit  and i will ask him to confide in me charles  therefore  did not keep so close upon the heels of the vampyre as to excite any suspicions of his intention to follow him  but he waited by the garden paling long enough not only for varney to get some distance off  but long enough likewise to know that the pistol which had been fired at the doctor had produced no real bad effects  except singing some curious tufts of hair upon the sides of his face  which the doctor was pleased to call whiskers i thought as much  was charles s exclamation when he heard the doctor s voice  it would have been strikingly at variance with all varney s other conduct  if he had committed such a deliberate and heartless murder then  as the form of the vampyre could be but dimly seen  charles ran on for some distance in the direction he had taken  and then paused again so that if varney heard the sound of footsteps  and paused to listen they had ceased again probably  and nothing was discernible in this manner he followed the mysterious individual  if we may really call him such  for above a mile  and then varney made a rapid detour and took his way towards the town he went onwards with wonderful precision now in a right line  not stopping at any obstruction  in the way of fences  hedges  or ditches so that it took charles some exertion  to which  just then  he was scarcely equal  to keep up with him at length the outskirts of the town were gained  and then varney paused and looked around him  scarcely allowing charles  who was now closer to him than he had been  time to hide himself from observation  which however  he did accomplish  by casting himself suddenly upon the ground so that he could not be detected against the sky  which then formed a back ground to the spot where he was apparently satisfied that he had completely now eluded the pursuit  if any had been attempted  of those whom he had led in such a state of confusion  the vampyre walked hastily towards a house that was to let and which was only to be reached by going up an avenue of trees  and then unlocking a gate in a wall which bounded the premises next to the avenue  but the vampyre appeared to be possessed of every facility for effecting an entrance to the place and  producing from his pocket a key he at once opened the gate  and disappeared within the precincts of those premises he  no doubt  felt that he was hunted by the mob of the town  and hence his frequent change of residence  since his own had been burnt down and  indeed  situated as he was  there can be no manner of doubt that he would have been sacrificed to the superstitious fury of the populace  if they could but have got hold of him he had  from his knowledge  which was no doubt accurate and complete  of what had been done  a good idea of what his own fate would be  were he to fall into the hands of that ferocious multitude  each individual composing which  felt a conviction that there would be no peace  nor hope of prosperity or happiness  on the place  until he  the arch vampyre of all the supposed vampyres  was destroyed illustration charles did pause for a few moments  after having thus become roused  to consider whether he should then attempt to have the interview he had resolved upon having by some means or another  or defer it  now that he knew where varney was to be found  until another time but when he came to consider how extremely likely it was that  even in the course of a few hours  varney might shift his abode for some good and substantial reasons  he at once determined upon attempting to see him but how to accomplish such a purpose was not the easiest question in the world to answer  if he rung the bell that presented itself above the garden gate  was it at all likely that varney  who had come there for concealment  would pay any attention to the summons after some consideration  he did  however  think of a plan by which  at all events  he could ensure effecting an entrance into the premises  and then he would take his chance of finding the mysterious being whom he sought  and who probably might have no particular objection to meeting with him  charles holland  because their last interview in the ruins could not be said to be otherwise than of a peaceable and calm enough character he saw by the board  which was nailed in the front of the house  that all applications to see it were to be made to a mr  nash  residing close at hand  and  as charles had the appearance of a respectable person  he thought he might possibly have the key entrusted to him  ostensibly to look at the house  preparatory possibly to taking it  and so he should at all events  obtain admission he  accordingly  went at once to this mr  nash  and asked about the house  of course he had to affect an interest in its rental and accommodations  which he did not feel  in order to lull any suspicion and  finally  he said i should like to look over it if you will lend me the key  which i will shortly bring back to you there was an evident hesitation about the agent when this proposal was communicated by charles holland  and he said i dare say  sir  you wonder that i don t say yes  at once  but the fact is there came a gentleman here one day when i was out  and got a key for we have two to open the house  from my wife  and he never came back again that this was the means by which varney  the vampyre  had obtained the key  by the aid of which charles had seen him effect so immediate an entrance to the house  there could be no doubt how long ago were you served that trick  he said about two days ago  sir well  it only shows how  when one person acts wrongly  another is at once suspected of a capability to do so likewise  there is my name and my address  i should like rather to go alone to see the house  because i always fancy i can judge better by myself of the accommodation  and i can stay as long as i like  and ascertain the sizes of all the rooms without the disagreeable feeling upon my mind  which no amount of complaisance on your part  could ever get me over  that i was most unaccountably detaining somebody from more important business of their own oh  i assure you  sir  said mr  nash  that i should not be at all impatient  but if you would rather go alone indeed i would oh  then  sir  there is the key  a gentleman who leaves his name and address  of course  we can have no objection to  i only told you of what happened  sir  in the mere way of conversation  and i hope you won t imagine for a moment that i meant to insinuate that you were going to keep the key oh  certainly not certainly not  said charles  who was only too glad to get the key upon any terms  you are quite right  and i beg you will say no more about it  i quite understand he then walked off to the empty house again  and  proceeding to the avenue  he fitted the key to the lock  and had the satisfaction of finding the gate instantly yield to him when he passed through it  and closed the door after him  which he did carefully  he found himself in a handsomely laid out garden  and saw the house a short distance in front of him  standing upon a well got up lawn he cared not if varney should see him before he reached the house because the fact was sufficiently evident to himself that after all he could not actually enforce an interview with the vampyre  he only hoped that as he had found him out it would be conceded to him he  therefore  walked up the lawn without making the least attempt at concealment  and when he reached the house he allowed his footsteps to make what noise they would upon the stone steps which led up to it  but no one appeared  nor was there  either by sight or by sound  any indication of the presence of any living being in the place besides himself insensibly  as he contemplated the deserted place around him  the solemn sort of stillness began to have its effect upon his imagination  and without being aware that he did so  he had  with softness and caution glided onwards  as if he were bent on some errand requiring the utmost amount of caution and discrimination in the conduction of it and so he entered the hall of the house  where he stood some time  and listened with the greatest attention  without  however  being able to hear the least sound throughout the whole of the house and yet he must be here  thought charles to himself  i was not gone many minutes  and it is extremely unlikely that in so short a space of time he has left  after taking so much trouble  by making such a detour around the meadows to get here  without being observed  i will examine every room in the place  but i will find him charles immediately commenced going from room to room of that house in his search for the vampyre  there were but four apartments upon the ground floor  and these  of course  he quickly ran through  nothing whatever at all indicative of any one having been there met his gaze and with a feeling of disappointment creeping over him  he commenced the ascent of the staircase the day had now fairly commenced  so that there was abundance of light although  even for the country  it was an early hour  and probably mr nash had been not a little surprised to have a call from one whose appearance bespoke no necessity for rising with the lark at such an hour all these considerations  however  sank into insignificance in charles s mind  compared with the object he had in view  namely  the unravelling the many mysteries that hung around that man  he ascended to the landing of the first story  and then  as he could have no choice  he opened the first door that his eyes fell upon  and entered a tolerably large apartment  it was quite destitute of furniture  and at the moment charles was about to pronounce it empty  but then his eyes fell upon a large black looking bundle of something  that seemed to be lying jammed up under the window on the floor that being the place of all others in the room which was enveloped in the most shadow he started back involuntarily at the moment  for the appearance was one so shapeless  that there was no such thing as defining  from even that distance  what it really was then he slowly and cautiously approached it  as we always approach that of the character of which we are ignorant  and concerning the powers of which to do injury we can consequently have no defined idea that it was a human form there  was the first tangible opinion he had about it  and from its profound stillness  and the manner in which it seemed to be laid close under the window  he thought that he was surely upon the point of finding out that some deed of blood had been committed  the unfortunate victim of which was now lying before him upon a nearer examination  he found that the whole body  including the greater part of the head and face  was wrapped in a large cloak  and there  as he gazed  he soon found cause to correct his first opinion at to the form belonging to the dead  for he could distinctly hear the regular breathing  as of some one in a sound and dreamless sleep closer he went  and closer still  then  as he clasped his hands  he said  in a voice scarcely above a whisper it is it is the vampyre yes  there could be no doubt of the fact  it was sir francis varney who lay there  enveloped in the huge horseman s cloak  in which  on two or three occasions during the progress of this narrative  he had figured there he lay  at the mercy completely of any arm that might be raised against him  apparently so overcome by fatigue that no ordinary noise would have awakened him well might charles holland gaze at him with mingled feelings  there lay the being who had done almost enough to drive the beautiful flora bannerworth distracted the being who had compelled the bannerworth family to leave their ancient house  to which they had been bound by every description of association  the same mysterious existence  too who  the better to carry on his plots and plans  had  by dint of violence  immured him  charles  in a dungeon  and loaded him with chains  there he lay sleeping  and at his mercy shall i awaken him  said charles  or let him sleep off the fatigue which  no doubt  is weighing down his limbs  and setting heavily on his eyelids  no  my business with him is too urgent he then raised his voice  and cried varney  varney  awake the sound disturbed  without altogether breaking up  the deep slumber of the vampyre  and he uttered a low moan  and moved one hand restlessly then  as if that disturbance of the calm and deep repose which had sat upon him  had given at once the reins to fancy  he begin to mutter strange words in his sleep  some of which could be heard by charles distinctly  while others were too incoherently uttered to be clearly understood where is it  he said  where where hidden pull the house down murder  no  no  no  no murder i will not  i dare not  blood enough is upon my hands the money the money  down  villains  down down  down what these incoherent words alluded to specifically  charles  of course could not have the least idea  but he listened attentively  with a hope that something might fall from his lips that would afford a key to some of the mysterious circumstances with which he was so intimately connected now  however  there was a longer silence than before  only broken occasionally by low moans  but suddenly  as charles was thinking of again speaking  he uttered some more disjointed sentences no harm  he said  no harm marchdale is a villain not a hair of his head injured no  no  set him free yes  i will set him free beware  beware  marchdale  and you mortimer  the scaffold  ay  the scaffold  but where is the bright gold  the memory of the deed of blood will not cling to it  where is it hidden  the gold  the gold  the gold it is not in the grave it cannot be there no  no  no not there  not there  load the pistols  there  there  down  villain  down down down despairing  now  of obtaining anything like tangible information from these ravings  which  even if they did  by accident  so connect themselves together as to seem to mean something  charles again cried aloud varney  awake  awake but  as before  the sleeping man was sufficiently deaf to the cry to remain  with his eyes closed  still in a disturbed slumber  but yet a slumber which might last for a considerable time i have heard  said charles  that there are many persons whom no noise will awaken  while the slightest touch rouses them in an instant  i will try that upon this slumbering being as he spoke  he advanced close to sir francis varney  and touched him slightly with the toe of his boot the effect was as startling as it was instantaneous  the vampyre sprang to his feet  as he had been suddenly impelled up by some powerful machinery  and  casting his cloak away from his arms  so as to have them at liberty  he sprang upon charles holland  and hurled him to the ground  where he held him with a giant s gripe  as he cried rash fool  be you whom you may  why have you troubled me to rid the world of your intrusive existence the attack was so sudden and so terrific  that resistance to it  even if charles had had the power  was out of the question  all he could say was varney  varney  do you not know me  i am charles holland  will you now in your mad rage  take the life you might more easily have taken when i lay in the dungeon from which you released me the sound of his voice at once convinced sir francis varney of his identity  and it was with a voice that had some tones of regret in it that he replied and wherefore have you thought proper  when you were once free and unscathed  to cast yourself into such a position of danger as to follow me to my haunt i contemplated no danger  said charles  because i contemplated no evil  i do not know why you should kill me you came here  and yet you say you do not know why i should kill you young man  have you a dozen lives that you can afford to tamper with them thus  i have  at much chance of imminence to myself  already once saved you  when another  with a sterner feeling  would have gladly taken your life  but now  as if you were determined to goad me to an act which i have shunned committing  you will not let me close my eyes in peace take your hand from off my throat  varney  and i will then tell you what brought me here sir francis varney did so rise  he said rise  i have seen blood enough to be sickened at the prospect of more  but you should not have come here and tempted me nay  believe me  i came here for good and not for evil  sir francis varney  hear me out  and then judge for yourself whether you can blame the perseverance which enabled me to find out this secret place of refuge  but let me first say that now it is as good a place of concealment to you as before it was  for i shall not betray you go on  go on  what is it you desire during the long and weary hours of my captivity  i thought deeply  and painfully too  as may be well imagined  of all the circumstances connected with your appearance at bannerworth hall  and your subsequent conduct  then i felt convinced that there was something far more than met the eye  in the whole affair  and  from what i have been informed of since  i am the more convinced that some secret  some mystery  which it is in your power only perhaps to explain  lurks at the bottom of all your conduct well  proceed  said varney have i not said enough now to enable you to divine the object of my visit  it is that you should shake off the trammels of mystery in which you have shrouded yourself  and declare what it is you want  what it is you desire  that has induced you to set yourself up as such a determined foe of the bannerworth family and that  you say  is the modest request that brings you here you speak as if you thought it was idle curiosity that prompts me  but you know it is not  your language and manner are those of a man of too much sagacity not to see that i have higher notions name them you have yourself  in more than one instance  behaved with a strange sort of romantic generosity  as if  but for some great object which you felt impelled to seek by any means  and at any sacrifice  you would be a something in character and conduct very different from what you are  one of my objects  then  is to awaken that better nature which is slumbering within you  only now and then rousing itself to do some deed which should be the character of all your actions for your own sake i have come but not wholly not wholly  as you say  there is another than whom  the whole world is not so dear to me  that other one was serene as she was beautiful happiness danced in her eyes  and she ought for not more lovely is the mind that she possesses than the glorious form that enshrines it to be happy  her life should have passed like one long summer s day of beauty sunshine  and pure heavenly enjoyment  you have poisoned the cup of joy that the great god of nature had permitted her to place to her lips and taste of mistrustingly  why have you done this  i ask you why have you done this have you said all that you came to say i have spoken the substance of my message  much could i elaborate upon such a theme  but it is not one  varney  which is congenial to my heart for your sake  however  and for the sakes of those whom i hold most dear  let me implore you to act in this matter with a kindly consideration  proclaim your motives  you cannot say that they are not such as we may aid you in varney was silent for several moments  he seemed perceptibly moved by the manner of the young man  as well as by the matter of his discourse in fact  one would suppose that charles holland had succeeded in investing what he said with some sort of charm that won much upon the fancy of sir francis varney  for when he ceased to speak  the latter said in a low voice go on  go on  you have surely much more to say no  varney  i have said enough  and not thus much would i have said had i not been aware  most certainly and truly aware  without the shadow of a doubt  by your manner  that you were most accessible to human feeling i accessible to human feeling  know you to whom you speak  am i not he before whom all men shudder  whose name has been a terror and a desolation  and yet you can talk of my human feelings  nay  if i had had any  be sure they would have been extinguished by the persecutions i have endured from those who  you know  with savage ferocity have sought my life no  varney  i give you credit for being a subtler reasoner than thus to argue  you know well that you were the aggressor to those parties who sought your life  you know well that with the greatest imaginable pains you held yourself up to them as a thing of great terror i did i did you cannot  then  turn round upon ignorant persons  and blame them because your exertions to make yourself seem what you wish were but too successful you use the word seem  said varney  with a bitterness of aspect  as if you would imply a doubt that i am that which thousands  by their fears  would testify me to be thousands might  said charles holland  but not among them am i varney  i will not be made the victim of superstition  were you to enact before my very eyes some of those feats which  to the senses of others would stamp you as the preternatural being you assume to be  i would doubt the evidence of my own senses ere i permitted such a bugbear to oppress my brain go  said sir francis varney  go  i have no more words for you  i have nothing to relate to you nay  you have already listened sufficiently to me to give me a hope that i had awakened some of the humanity that was in your nature  do not  sir francis varney  crush that hope  even as it was budding forth not for my own sake do i ask you for revelations  that may perhaps must be painful for you  but for the sake of flora bannerworth to whom you owe abundance of reparation no  no in the name of all that is great  and good  and just  i call upon you for justice what have i to do with such an invocation  utter such a sentiment to men who  like yourself  are invested with the reality as well as the outward show of human nature nay  sir francis varney  now you belie yourself  you have passed through a long  and  perchance  a stormy life  can you look back upon your career  and find no reminiscences of the past that shall convince you that you are of the great family of man  and have had abundance of human feelings and of human affections peace  peace nay  sir francis varney  i will take your word  and if you will lay your hand upon your heart  and tell me truly that you never felt what it was to love to have all feeling  all taste  and all hope of future joy concentrated in one individual  i will despair  and leave you  if you will tell me that never  in your whole life  you have felt for any fair and glorious creature  as i now feel for flora bannerworth  a being for whom you could have sacrificed not only existence  but all the hopes of a glorious future that bloom around it if you will tell me  with the calm  dispassionate aspect of truth  that you have held yourself aloof from such human feelings  i will no longer press you to a disclosure which i shall bring no argument to urge the agitation of sir francis varney s countenance was perceptible  and charles holland was about to speak again  when  striking him upon the breast with his clinched hand  the vampyre checked him  saying do you wish to drive me mad  that you thus  from memory s hidden cells conjure up images of the past then there are such images to conjure up there are such shadows only sleeping  but which require only  as you did even now  but a touch to awaken them to life and energy  oh  sir francis varney  do not tell me that you are not human the vampyre made a furious gesture  as if he would have attacked charles holland  but then he sank nearly to the floor  as if soul stricken by some recollection that unnerved his arm  he shook with unwonted emotion and  from the frightful livid aspect of his countenance  charles dreaded some serious accession of indisposition  which might  if nothing else did  prevent him from making the revelation he so much sought to hear from his lips varney  he cried  varney  be calm  you will be listened to by one who will draw no harsh no hasty conclusions  by one  who  with that charity  i grieve to say  is rare  will place upon the words you utter the most favourable construction  tell me all  i pray you  tell me all this is strange  said the vampyre  i never thought that aught human could thus have moved me  young man  you have touched the chords of memory  they vibrate throughout my heart  producing cadences and sounds of years long past  bear with me awhile and you will speak to me i will having your promise  then  i am content  varney but you must be secret  not even in the wildest waste of nature  where you can well presume that naught but heaven can listen to your whisperings  must you utter one word of that which i shall tell to you alas  said charles  i dare not take such a confidence  i have said that it is not for myself  i seek such knowledge of what you are  and what you have been  but it is for another so dear to me  that all the charms of life that make up other men s delights  equal not the witchery of one glance from her  speaking as it does of the glorious light from that heaven which is eternal  from whence she sprung and you reject my communication  said varney  because i will not give you leave to expose it to flora bannerworth it must be so and you are most anxious to hear that which i have to relate most anxious  indeed indeed  most anxious then have i found in that scruple which besets your mind  a better argument for trusting you  than had ye been loud in protestation  had your promises of secrecy been but those which come from the lip  and not from the heart  my confidence would not have been rejected on such grounds  i think that i dare trust you with leave to tell to flora that which you shall communicate you may whisper it to her  but to no one else  without my special leave and licence i agree to those terms  and will religiously preserve them i do not doubt you for one moment  and now i will tell to you what never yet has passed my lips to mortal man  now will i connect together some matters which you may have heard piecemeal from others what others are they dr  chillingworth  and he who once officiated as a london hangman i have heard something from those quarters listen then to me  and you shall better understand that which you have heard  some years ago  it matters not the number  on a stormy night towards the autumn of the year  two men sat alone in poverty  and that species of distress which beset the haughty  profligate  daring man  who has been accustomed all his life to its most enticing enjoyments  but never to that industry which alone ought to produce them  and render them great and magnificent two men  and who were they i was one  look upon me  i was of those men  and strong and evil passions were battling in my heart and the other was marmaduke bannerworth gracious heaven  the father of her whom i adore  the suicide yes  the same  that man stained with a thousand vices blasted by a thousand crimes the father of her who partakes nothing of his nature who borrows nothing from his memory but his name was the man who there sat with me  plotting and contriving how  by fraud or violence  we were to lead our usual life of revelry and wild audacious debauch go on  go on  believe me  i am deeply interested i can see as much  we were not nice in the various schemes which our prolific fancies engendered  if trickery  and the false dice at the gaming table  sufficed not to fill our purses  we were bold enough for violence  if simple robbery would not succeed  we could take a life murder ay  call it by its proper name  a murder  we sat till the midnight hour had passed  without arriving at a definite conclusion  we saw no plan of practicable operation  and so we wandered onwards to one of those deep dens of iniquity  a gaming house  wherein we had won and lost thousands we had no money  but we staked largely  in the shape of a wager  upon the success of one of the players  we knew not  or cared not  for the consequence  if we had lost  but  as it happened  we were largely successful  and beggars as we had walked into that place  we might have left it independent men but when does the gambler know when to pause in his career  if defeat awakens all the raging passions of humanity within his bosom  success but feeds the great vice that has been there engendered  to the dawn of morn we played  the bright sun shone in  and yet we played the midday came  and went the stimulant of wine supported us  and still we played then came the shadows of evening  stealing on in all their beauty  but what were they to us  amid those mutations of fortune  which  at one moment  made us princes  and placed palaces at our control  and  at another  debased us below the veriest beggar  that craves the stinted alms of charity from door to door and there was one man who  from the first to the last  stayed by us like a very fiend  more than man  i thought he was not human  we won of all  but of him  people came and brought their bright red gold  and laid it down before us  but for us to take it up  and then  by a cruel stroke of fortune  he took it from us the night came on  we won  and he won of us  the clock struck twelve we were beggars  god knows what was he we saw him place his winnings about his person we saw the smile that curved the corners of his lips  he was calm  and we were maddened  the blood flowed temperately through his veins  but in ours it was burning lava  scorching as it went through every petty artery  and drying up all human thought all human feeling the winner left  and we tracked his footsteps  when he reached the open air  although he had taken much less than we of the intoxicating beverages that are supplied gratis to those who frequent those haunts of infamy  it was evident that some sort of inebriation attacked him  his steps were disordered and unsteady  and  as we followed him  we could perceive  by the devious track that he took  that he was somewhat uncertain of his route we had no fixed motive in so pursuing this man  it was but an impulsive proceeding at the best  but as he still went on and cleared the streets getting into the wild and open country  and among the hedge rows  we began to whisper together  and to think that what we did not owe to fortune  we might to our own energy and courage at such a moment i need not hesitate to say so  since  to hide the most important feature of my revelation from you  would be but to mock you  we resolved upon robbing him and was that all it was all that our resolution went to  we were not anxious to spill blood  but still we were resolved that we would accomplish our purpose even if it required murder for its consummation  have you heard enough i have not heard enough  although i guess the rest you may well guess it  from its preface  he turned down a lonely pathway  which  had we chosen it ourselves  could not have been more suitable for the attack we meditated there were tall trees on either side  and a hedge row stretching high up between them  we knew that that lane led to a suburban village which  without a doubt  was the object of his destination then marmaduke bannerworth spoke  saying what we have to do  must be done now or never  there needs not two in this adventure  shall you or i require him to refund what he has won from us i care not  i said  but if we are to accomplish our purpose without arousing even a shadow of resistance  it is better to show him its futility by both appearing  and take a share in the adventure this was agreed upon  and we hastened forward  he heard footsteps pursuing him and quickened his pace  i was the fleetest runner  and overtook him  i passed him a pace or two  and then turning  i faced him and impeded his progress the lane was narrow  and a glance behind him showed him marmaduke bannerworth  so that he was hemmed in between two enemies  and could move neither to the right nor to the left  on account of the thick brushwood that intervened between the trees then  with an assumed courage  that sat but ill upon him  he demanded of us what we wanted  and proclaimed his right to pass despite the obstruction we placed in his way the dialogue was brief  i  being foremost  spoke to him your money  i said  your winnings at the gaming table  we cannot and we will not lose it so suddenly  that he had nearly taken my life  he drew a pistol from his pocket  and levelling it at my head  he fired upon me perhaps  had i moved  it might have been my death  but  as it was  the bullet furrowed my cheek  leaving a scar  the path of which is yet visible in a white cicatrix i felt a stunning sensation  and thought myself a dead man  i cried aloud to marmaduke bannerworth  and he rushed forward  i knew not that he was armed  and that he had the power about him to do the deed which he then accomplished  but there was a groan  a slight struggle  and the successful gamester fell upon the green sward  bathed in his blood and this is the father of her whom i adore it is  are you shocked to think of such a neat relationship between so much beauty and intelligence and a midnight murderer  is your philosophy so poor  that the daughter s beauty suffers from the commission of a father s crime no  no  it is not so  do not fancy that  for one moment  i can entertain such unworthy opinions  the thought that crossed me was that i should have to tell one of such a gentle nature that her father had done such a deed on that head you can use your own discretion  the deed was done  there was sufficient light for us to look upon the features of the dying man ghastly and terrific they glared upon us  while the glazed eyes  as they were upturned to the bright sky  seemed appealing to heaven for vengeance against us  for having done the deed many a day and many an hour since at all times and all seasons  i have seen those eyes  with the glaze of death upon them  following me  and gloating over the misery they had the power to make  i think i see them now indeed yes  look look see how they glare upon me with what a fixed and frightful stare the bloodshot pupils keep their place there  there  oh save me from such a visitation again  it is too horrible  i dare not i cannot endure it  and yet why do you gaze at me with such an aspect dread visitant  you know that it was not my hand that did the deed who laid you low  you know that not to me are you able to lay the heavy charge of your death varney  you look upon vacancy  said charles holland no  no  vacancy it may be to you  but to me tis full of horrible shapes compose yourself  you have taken me far into your confidence already  i pray you now to tell me all  i have in my brain no room for horrible conjectures such as those which might else torment me varney was silent for a few minutes  and then he wiped from his brow the heavy drops of perspiration that had there gathered  and heaved a deep sigh speak to me  added charles  nothing will so much relieve you from the terrors of this remembrance as making a confidence which reflection will approve of  and which you will know that you have no reason to repent charles holland  said varney  i have already gone too far to retract much too far  i know  and can well understand all the danger of half confidence  you already know so much  that it is fit you should know more go on then  varney  i will listen to you i know not if  at this juncture  i can command myself to say more  i feel that what next has to be told will be most horrible for me to tell most sad for you to hear told i can well believe  varney  from your manner of speech  and from the words you use  that you have some secret to relate beyond this simple fact of the murder of this gamester by marmaduke bannerworth you are right such is the fact  the death of that man could not have moved me as you now see me moved  there is a secret connected with his fate which i may well hesitate to utter a secret even to whisper to the winds of heaven i although i did not do the deed  no  no i i did not strike the blow not i not i illustration varney  it is astonishing to me the pains you take to assure yourself of your innocence of this deed  no one accuses you  but still  were it not that i am impressed with a strong conviction that you re speaking to me nothing but the truth  the very fact of your extreme anxiety to acquit yourself  would engender suspicion i can understand that feeling  charles holland  i can fully understand it  i do not blame you for it it is a most natural one  but when you know all  you will feel with me how necessary it must have been to my peace to seize upon every trivial circumstance that can help me to a belief in my own innocence it may be so  as yet  you well know  i speak in ignorance  but what could there have been in the character of that gambler  that has made you so sympathetic concerning his decease nothing nothing whatever in his character  he was a bad man  not one of those free  open spirits which are seduced into crime by thoughtlessness not one of those whom we pity  perchance  more than we condemn  but a man without a redeeming trait in his disposition a man so heaped up with vices and iniquities  that society gained much by his decease  and not an individual could say that he had lost a friend and yet the mere thought of the circumstances connected with his death seems almost to drive you to the verge of despair you are right  the mere thought has that effect you have aroused all my curiosity to know the causes of such a feeling varney paced the apartment in silence for many minutes  he seemed to be enduring a great mental struggle  and at length  when he turned to charles holland and spoke  there were upon his countenance traces of deep emotion i have said  young man  that i will take you into my confidence  i have said that i will clear up many seeming mysteries  and that i will enable you to understand what was obscure in the narrative of dr chillingworth  and of that man who filled the office of public executioner  and who has haunted me so long it is true  then  as the doctor states  that you were executed in london i was and resuscitated by the galvanic process  put into operation by dr chillingworth as he supposed  but there are truths connected with natural philosophy which he dreamed not of  i bear a charmed life  and it was but accident which produced a similar effect upon the latent springs of my existence in the house to which the executioner conducted me  to what would have been produced had i been sufficed  in the free and open air  to wait until the cool moonbeams fell upon me varney  varney  said charles holland  you will not succeed in convincing me of your supernatural powers  i hold such feelings and sensations at arm s length  i will not i cannot assume you to be what you affect i ask for no man s belief  i know that which i know  and  gathering experience from the coincidences of different phenomena  i am compelled to arrive at certain conclusions  believe what you please  doubt what you please  but i say again that i am not as other men i am in no condition to depute your proposition  i wish not to dispute it  but you are wandering  varney  from the point  i wait anxiously for a continuation of your narrative i know that i am wandering from it i know well that i am wandering from it  and that the reason i do so is that i dread that continuation that dread will nor be the less for its postponement you are right  but tell me  charles holland  although you are young you have been about in the great world sufficiently to form correct opinions  and to understand that which is related to you  drawing proper deductions from certain facts  and arriving possibly at more correct conclusions than some of maturer years with less wisdom i will freely answer  varney  any question you may put to me i know it  tell me then what measure of guilt you attach to me in the transaction i have noticed to you it seems then to me that  not contemplating the man s murder  you cannot be accused of the act  although a set of fortuitous circumstances made you appear an accomplice to its commission you think i may be acquitted you can acquit yourself  knowing that you did not contemplate the murder i did not contemplate it  i know not what desperate deed i should have stopped short at then  in the height of my distress  but i neither contemplated taking that man s life  nor did i strike the blow which sent him from existence there is even some excuse as regards the higher crime for marmaduke bannerworth think you so yes  he thought that you were killed  and impulsively he might have struck the blow that made him a murderer be it so  i am willing  extremely willing that anything should occur that should remove the odium of guilt from any man  be it so  i say with all my heart  but now  charles holland  i feel that we must meet again ere i can tell you all  but in the meantime let flora bannerworth rest in peace she need dread nothing from me  avarice and revenge  the two passions which found a home in my heart  are now stifled for ever revenge  did you say revenge i did  whence the marvel  am i not sufficiently human for that but you coupled it with the name of flora bannerworth i did  and that is part of my mystery a mystery  indeed  to imagine that such a being as flora could awaken any such feeling in your heart a most abundant mystery it is so  i do not affect to deny it  but yet it is true  although so greatly mysterious  but tell her that although at one time i looked upon her as one whom i cared not if i injured  her beauty and distress changed the current of my thoughts  and won upon me greatly  from the moment i found i had the power to become the bane of her existence  i ceased to wish to be so  and never again shall she experience a pang of alarm from varney  the vampyre your message shall be faithfully delivered  and doubt not that it will be received with grateful feelings  nevertheless i should have much wished to have been in a position to inform her of more particulars come to me here at midnight to morrow  and you shall know all  i will have no reservation with you  no concealments  you shall know whom i have had to battle against  and how it is that a world of evil passions took possession of my heart and made me what i am are you firm in this determination  varney will you indeed tell me no more to night no more  i have said it  leave me now  i have need of more repose  for of late sleep has seldom closed my eyelids charles holland was convinced  from the positive manner in which he spoke  that nothing more in the shape of information  at that time  was to be expected from varney  and being fearful that if he urged this strange being too far  at a time when he did not wish it  he might refuse all further communication  he thought it prudent to leave him  so he said to him be assured  varney  i shall keep the appointment you have made  with an expectation when we do meet of being rewarded by a recital of some full particulars you shall not be disappointed  farewell  farewell charles holland bade him adieu  and left the place although he had now acquired all the information he hoped to take away with him when varney first began to be communicative  yet  when he came to consider how strange and unaccountable a being he had been in communication with  charles could not but congratulate himself that he had heard so much  for  from the manner of varney  he could well suppose that that was  indeed  the first time he had been so communicative upon subjects which evidently held so conspicuous a place in his heart and he had abundance of hope  likewise  from what had been said by varney  that he would keep his word  and communicate to him fully all else that he required to know  and when he recollected those words which varney had used  signifying that he knew the danger of half confidences that hope grew into a certainty  and charles began to have no doubt but that on the next evening all that was mysterious in the various affairs connected with the vampyre would become clear and open to the light of day he strolled down the lane in which the lone house was situated revolving these matters in his mind  and when he arrived at its entrance  he was rather surprised to see a throng of persons hastily moving onward  with come appearance of dismay about them  and anxiety depicted upon their countenances he stopped a lad  and inquired of him the cause of the seeming tumult why  sir  the fact is  said the boy  a crowd from the town s been burning down bannerworth hall  and they ve killed a man bannerworth hall  you must be mistaken well  sir  i ought not to call it bannerworth hall  because i mean the old ruins in the neighbourhood that are supposed to have been originally bannerworth hall before the house now called such was built  and moreover  as the bannerworths have always had a garden there  and two or three old sheds  the people in the town called it bannerworth hall in common with the other building i understand  and do you say that all have been destroyed yes  sir  all that was capable of being burnt has been burnt  and  what is more  a man has been killed among the ruins  we don t know who he is but the folks said he was a vampyre  and they left him for dead when will these terrible outrages cease  oh  varney  varney  you have much to answer for  even if in your conscience you succeed in acquitting yourself of the murder  some of the particulars concerning which you have informed me of chapter lxxxiii the mysterious arrival at the inn the hungarian nobleman the letter to varney illustration while these affairs are proceeding  and when there seems every appearance of sir francis varney himself quickly putting an end to some of the vexatious circumstances connected with himself and the bannerworth family  it is necessary that we should notice an occurrence which took place at the same inn which the admiral had made such a scene of confusion upon the occasion of his first arrival in the town not since the admiral had arrived with jack pringle  and so disturbed the whole economy of the household  was there so much curiosity excited as on the morning following the interview which charles holland had had with varney  the vampyre the inn was scarcely opened  when a stranger arrived  mounted on a coal black horse  and  alighting  he surrendered the bridle into the hands of a boy who happened to be at the inn door  and stalked slowly and solemnly into the building he was tall  and of a cadaverous aspect  in attire he was plainly apparelled  but there was no appearance of poverty about him  on the contrary  what he really had on was of a rich and costly character although destitute of ornament he sat down in the first room that presented itself  and awaited the appearance of the landlord  who  upon being informed that a guest of apparently ample means  and of some consequence  had entered the place hastily went to him to receive his commands with a profusion of bows  our old friend  who had been so obsequious to admiral bell  entered the room  and begged to know what orders the gentleman had for him i presume  said the stranger  in a deep  solemn voice  i presume that you have no objection  for a few days that i shall remain in this town to board and lodge me for a certain price which you can name to me at once certainly  sir  said the landlord  any way you please  without wine sir  i presume as you please  make your own arrangements well  sir  as we can t tell  of course  what wine a gentleman may drink  but when we come to consider breakfast  dinner  tea  and supper and a bed  and all that sort of thing  and a private sitting room  i suppose  sir certainly you would not  then  think  sir  a matter of four guineas a week will be too much  perhaps i told you to name your own charge  let it be four guineas  if you had said eight i should have paid it good god  said the publican  here s a damned fool that i am  i beg your pardon  sir  i didn t mean you  now i could punch my own head will you have breakfast at once  sir  and then we shall begin regular  you know  sir have what breakfast  breakfast  you know  sir  tea  coffee  cocoa  or chocolate ham  eggs  or a bit of grilled fowl  cold sirloin of roast beef  or a red herring anything you like  sir i never take breakfast  so you may spare yourself the trouble of providing anything for me not take breakfast  sir  not take breakfast  would you like to take anything to drink then  sir  people say it s an odd time  at eight o clock in the morning  to drink  but  for my part  i always have thought that you couldn t begin a good thing too soon i live upon drink  said the stranger  but you have none in the cellar that will suit me indeed  sir no  no  i am certain why  we ve got some claret now  sir  said the landlord which may look like blood  and yet not be it like what  sir damn my rags begone  begone the stranger uttered these words so peremptorily that the landlord hastily left the room  and going into his own bar  he gave himself so small a tap on the side of the head  that it would not have hurt a fly as he said i could punch myself into bits  i could tear my hair out by the roots and then he pulled a little bit of his hair  so gently and tenderly that it showed what a man of discretion he was  even in the worst of all his agony of passion the idea  he added  of a fellow coming here  paying four guineas a week for board and lodging  telling me he would not have minded eight and then not wanting any breakfast  it s enough to aggravate half a dozen saints  but what an odd fish he looks at this moment the ostler came in  and  standing at the bar  he wiped his mouth with his sleeve  as he said i suppose you ll stand a quart for that  master a quart for what  you vagabond  a quart because i ve done myself up in heaps  a quart because i m fit to pull myself into fiddlestrings no  said the ostler  because i ve just put up the gentleman s horse what gentleman s horse why  the big looking fellow with the white face  now in the parlour what  did he come on a horse  sam  what sort of a looking creature is it  you may judge of a man from the sort of horse company he keeps well  then  sir  i hardly know  it s coal black  and looks as knowing as possible  it s tried twice to get a kick at me  but i was down upon him  and put the bucket in his way  howsomdever  i don t think it s a bad animal  as a animal  mind you  sir  though a little bit wicious or so well  said the publican  as he drew the ostler half a pint instead of a quart  you re always drinking  take that blow me  said the ostler  half a pint  master plague take you  i can t stand parleying with you  there s the parlour bell  perhaps  after all  he will have some breakfast while the landlord was away the ostler helped himself to a quart of the strongest ale  which  by a singular faculty that he had acquired  he poured down his throat without any effort at swallowing  holding his head back  and the jug at a little distance from his mouth having accomplished this feat  he reversed the jug  giving it a knowing tap with his knuckles as though he would have signified to all the world that it was empty  and that he had accomplished what he desired in the meantime  the landlord had made his way to his strange guest  who said to him  when he came into the room is there not one sir francis varney residing in this town the devil  thought the landlord  this is another of them  i ll bet a guinea  sir francis varney  sir  did you say  why  sir  there was a sir francis varney  but folks seem to think as how he s no better than he should be a sort of vampyre  sir  if you know what that is i have  certainly  heard of such things  but can you not tell me varney s address  i wish to see him well  then  sir  i cannot tell it to you  for there s really been such a commotion and such a riot about him that he s taken himself off  i think  altogether  and we can hear nothing of him  lord bless you  sir they burnt down his house  and hunted him about so  that i don t think that he ll ever show his face here again and cannot you tell me where he was seen last that i cannot  sir  but  if anybody knows anything about him  it s mr henry bannerworth  or perhaps dr  chillingworth  for they have had more to do with him than anybody else indeed  and can you tell me the address of the former individual that i can t  sir  for the bannerworths have left the hall  as for the doctor  sir  you ll see his house in the high street  with a large brass plate on the door  so that you cannot mistake it  it s no   on the other side of the way i thank you for so much information  said the stranger  and rising  he walked to the door  before  however  he left  he turned  and added you can say  if you should by chance meet mr  bannerworth  that a hungarian nobleman wishes to speak to him concerning sir francis varney  the vampyre a what  sir a nobleman from hungary  was the reply the deuce  said the landlord  as he looked after him  he don t seem at all hungry here  not thirsty neither  what does he mean by a nobleman from hungary  the idea of a man talking about hungry  and not taking any breakfast  he s queering me  i ll be hanged if i ll stand it  here i clearly lose four guineas a week  and then get made game of besides  a nobleman  indeed  i think i see him  why  he isn t quite so big as old slaney  the butcher  it s a do  i ll have at him when he comes back meanwhile  the unconscious object of this soliloquy passed down the high street  until he came to dr  chillingworth s  at whose door he knocked now mrs  chillingworth had been waiting the whole night for the return of the doctor  who had not yet made his appearance  and  consequently that lady s temper had become acidulated to an uncommon extent and when she heard a knock at the door  something possessed her that it could be no other than her spouse  and she prepared to give him that warm reception which she considered he had a right  as a married man  to expect after such conduct she hurriedly filled a tolerably sized hand basin with not the cleanest water in the world  and then  opening the door hurriedly with one hand she slouced the contents into the face of the intruder  exclaiming now you ve caught it d n  said the hungarian nobleman  and then mrs  chillingworth uttered a scream  for she feared she had made a mistake oh  sir  i m very sorry  but i thought it was my husband but if you did  said the stranger  there was no occasion to drown him with a basin of soap suds  it is your husband i want  madam  if he be dr  chillingworth then  indeed  you must go on wanting him  sir  for he s not been to his own home for a day and a night  he takes up all his time in hunting after that beastly vampyre ah  sir francis varney  you mean i do  and i d varney him if i caught hold of him can you give me the least idea of where he can be found of course i can indeed  where  said the stranger  eagerly in some churchyard  to be sure  gobbling up the dead bodies with this mrs  chillingworth shut the door with a bang that nearly flattened the hungarian s nose with his face  and he was fain to walk away  quite convinced that there was no information to be had in that quarter he returned to the inn  and having told the landlord that he would give a handsome reward to any one who would discover to him the retreat of sir francis varney  he shut himself up in an apartment alone  and was busy for a time in writing letters although the sum which the stranger offered was an indefinite one  the landlord mentioned the matter across the bar to several persons  but all of them shook their heads  believing it to be a very perilous adventure indeed to have anything to do with so troublesome a subject as sir francis varney  as the day advanced  however  a young lad presented himself  and asked to see the gentleman who had been inquiring for varney the landlord severely questioned and cross questioned him  with the hope of discovering if he had any information  but the boy was quite obdurate  and would speak to no one but the person who had offered the reward  so that mine host was compelled to introduce him to the hungarian nobleman  who  as yet  had neither eaten nor drunk in the house the boy wore upon his countenance the very expression of juvenile cunning  and when the stranger asked him if he really was in possession of any information concerning the retreat of sir francis varney  he said i can tell you where he is  but what are you going to give what sum do you require  said the stranger a whole half crown it is your s  and  if your information prove correct  come to morrow and i ll add another to it  always provided  likewise  you keep the secret from any one else trust me for that  said the boy  i live with my grandmother  she s precious old  and has got a cottage  we sell milk and cakes  sticky stuff  and pennywinkles a goodly collection  go on well  sir  this morning  there comes a man in with a bottle  and he buys a bottle full of milk and a loaf  i saw him  and i knew it was varney  the vampyre you followed him of course i did  sir  and he s staying at the house that s to let down the lane  round the corner  by mr  biggs s  and past lee s garden leaving old slaney s stacks on your right hand  and so cutting on till you come to grants s meadow  when you ll see old madhunter a brick field staring of you in the face  and  arter that peace peace you shall yourself conduct me  come to this place at sunset  be secret  and  probably  ten times the reward you have already received may be yours  said the stranger what  ten half crowns yes  i will keep my word with you what a go  i know what i ll do  i ll set up as a show man  and what a glorious treat it will be  to peep through one of the holes all day myself  and get somebody to pull the strings up and down  and when i m tired of that  i can blaze away upon the trumpet like one o clock  i think i see me  here you sees the duke of marlborough a whopping of everybody  and here you see the frenchmen flying about like parched peas in a sifter chapter lxxxiv the excited populace varney hunted the place of refuge illustration there seemed  now a complete lull in the proceedings as connected with varney  the vampyre  we have reason to believe that the executioner who had been as solicitous as varney to obtain undisputed possession of bannerworth hall  has fallen a victim to the indiscriminating rage of the mob  varney himself is a fugitive  and bound by the most solemn ties to charles holland  not only to communicate to him such particulars of the past  as will bring satisfaction to his mind  but to abstain from any act which  for the future  shall exercise a disastrous influence upon the happiness of flora the doctor and the admiral  with henry  had betaken themselves from the hall as we had recorded  and  in due time  reached the cottage where flora and her mother had found a temporary refuge mrs  bannerworth was up  but flora was sleeping  and  although the tidings they had to tell were of a curious and mixed nature  they would not have her disturbed to listen to them and  likewise  they were rather pleased than otherwise  since they knew not exactly what had become of charles holland  to think that they would probably be spared the necessity of saying they could not account for his absence that he had gone upon some expedition  probably dangerous  and so one which he did not wish to communicate the particulars of to his friends lest they should make a strong attempt to dissuade him from it  they were induced to believe but yet they had that confidence in his courage and active intellectual resources  to believe that he would come through it unscathed  and probably  shortly show himself at the cottage in this hope they were not disappointed  for in about two hours charles made his appearance  but  until he began to be questioned concerning his absence by the admiral  he scarcely considered the kind of dilemma he had put himself into by the promise of secrecy he had given to varney and was a little puzzled to think how much he might tell  and how much he was bound in honour to conceal avast there  cried the admiral  what s become of your tongue charles  you ve been on some cruize  i ll be bound  haul over the ship s books  and tell us what s happened i have been upon an adventure  said charles  which i hope will be productive of beneficial results to us all  but  the fact is  i have made a promise  perhaps incautiously  that i will not communicate what i know whew  said the admiral  that s awkward  but  however  if a man said under sealed instructions  there s an end of it  i remember when i was off candia once ha  interposed jack  that was the time you tumbled over the blessed binnacle  all in consequence of taking too much madeira  i remember it too it s an out and out good story  that ere  you took a rope s end you know  and laid into the bowsprit  and  says you  get up  you lubber  says you  all the while a thinking  i supposes  as it was long jack ingram  the carpenter s mate  laying asleep  what a lark this scoundrel will be the death of me  said the admiral  there isn t one word of truth in what he says  i never got drunk in all my life  as everybody knows  jack  affairs are getting serious between you and i we must part  and for good  it s a good many times that i ve told you you ve forgot the difference between the quarter deck and the caboose now  i m serious you re off the ship s books  and there s an end of you very good  said jack  i m willing i ll leave you  do you think i want to keep you any longer  good bye  old bloak i ll leave you to repent and when old grim death comes yard arm and yard arm with you  and you can t shake off his boarding tackle  you ll say  where s jack pringle says you  and then what s his mane oh ah  echo you call it echo ll say  it s d d if it knows jack turned upon his heel  and  before the admiral could make any reply he left the place what s the rascal up to now  said the admiral  i really didn t think he d have taken me at my word oh  then  after all  you didn t mean it  uncle  said charles what s that to you  you lubber  whether i mean it  or not  you shore going squab  of course i expect everybody to desert an old hulk rats and all and now jack pringle s gone  the vagabond  couldn t he stay  and get drunk as long as he liked  didn t he say what he pleased and do what he pleased  the mutinous thief  didn t he say i run away from a frenchman off cape ushant  and didn t i put up with that but  my dear uncle  you sent him away yourself i didn t  and you know i didn t  but i see how it is  you ve disgusted jack among you  a better seaman never trod the deck of a man of war but his drunkenness  uncle it s a lie  i don t believe he ever got drunk  i believe you all invented it  and jack s so good natured  he tumbled about just to keep you in countenance but his insolence  uncle  his gross insolence towards you his inventions  his exaggerations of the truth avast  there avast  there none of that  master charlie  jack couldn t do anything of the sort  and i means to say this  that if jack was here now  i d stick up for him  and say he was a good seaman tip us your fin  then  said jack  darting into the room  do you think i d leave you  you d d old fool  what would become of you  i wonder if i wasn t to take you in to dry nurse  why  you blessed old babby what do you mean by it jack  you villain ah  go on and call me a villain as much as you like  don t you remember when the bullets were scuttling our nobs i do  i do  jack  tip us your fin  old fellow  you ve saved my life more than once it s a lie it ain t  you did  i say you bed d and thus was the most serious misunderstanding that these two worthies ever had together made up  the real fact is  that the admiral could as little do without jack  as he could have done without food  and as for pringle  he no more thought of leaving the old commodore  than of what shall we say  forswearing him  jack himself could not have taken a stronger oath but the old admiral had suffered so much from the idea that jack had actually left him  that although he abused him as usual often enough  he never again talked of taking him off the ship s books  and  to the credit of jack be it spoken  he took no advantage of the circumstance and only got drunk just as usual  and called his master an old fool whenever it suited him chapter lxxxv the hungarian nobleman gets into danger he is fired at  and shows some of his quality illustration considerably delighted was the hungarian  not only at the news he had received from the boy  but as well for the cheapness of it  probably he did not conceive it possible that the secret of the retreat of such a man as varney could have been attained so easily he waited with great impatience for the evening  and stirred not from the inn for several hours  neither did he take any refreshment notwithstanding he had made so liberal an arrangement with the landlord to be supplied all this was a matter of great excitement and speculation in the inn  so much so  indeed  that the landlord sent for some of the oldest customers of his house  regular topers  who sat there every evening  indulging in strong drinks  and pipes and tobacco  to ask their serious advice as to what he should do  as if it were necessary he should do anything at all but  somehow or another  these wiseacres who assembled at the landlord s bidding  and sat down  with something strong before them  in the bar parlour  never once seemed to think that a man might  if he choosed come to an inn  and agree to pay four guineas a week for board and lodging  and yet take nothing at all no  they could not understand it  and therefore they would not have it it was quite monstrous that anybody should attempt to do anything so completely out of the ordinary course of proceeding  it was not to be borne  and as in this country it happens  free and enlightened as we are  that no man can commit a greater social offence than doing something that his neighbours never thought of doing themselves  the hungarian nobleman was voted a most dangerous character  and  in fact not to be put up with i shouldn t have thought so much of it  said the landlord  but only look at the aggravation of the thing  after i have asked him four guineas a week  and expected to be beaten down to two  to be then told that he would not have cared if it had been eight  it is enough to aggravate a saint well  i agree with you there  said another  that s just what it is and i only wonder that a man of your sagacity has not quite understood it before understood what why  that he is a vampyre  he has heard of sir francis varney  that s the fact  and he s come to see him  birds of a feather  you know  flock together  and now we shall have two vampyres in the town instead of one illustration the party looked rather blank at this suggestion  which  indeed  seemed rather uncomfortable probably  the landlord had just opened his mouth to make some remark  when he was stopped by the violent ringing of what he now called the vampyre s bell  since it proceeded from the room where the hungarian nobleman was have you an almanack in the house  was the question of the mysterious guest an almanack  sir  well  i really don t know  let me see  an almanack but  perhaps  you can tell me  i was to know the moon s age the devil  thought the landlord  he s a vampyre  and no mistake  why sir  as to the moon s age  it was a full moon last night  very bright and beautiful  only you could not see it for the clouds a full moon last night  said the mysterious guest  thoughtfully  it may shine  then  brightly  to night  and if so  all will be well  i thank you leave the room do you mean to say  sir  you don t want anything to eat now what i want i ll order but you have ordered nothing then presume that i want nothing the discomfited landlord was obliged to leave the room  for there was no such a thing as making any answer to this  and so  still further confirmed in his opinion that the stranger was a vampyre that came to see sir francis varney from a sympathetic feeling towards him  he again reached the bar parlour you may depend  he said  as sure as eggs is eggs  that he is a vampyre  hilloa  he s going off after him after him  he thinks we suspect him  there he goes down the high street the landlord ran out  and so did those who were with him  one of whom carried his brandy and water in his hand  which  being too hot for him to swallow all at once  he still could not think of leaving behind it was now gelling rapidly dark  and the mysterious stranger was actually proceeding towards the lane to keep his appointment with the boy who had promised to conduct him to the hiding place of sir francis varney he had not proceeded far  however  before he began to suspect that he was followed  as it was evident on the instant that he altered his course  for  instead of walking down the lane  where the boy was waiting for him  he went right on  and seemed desirous of making his way into the open country between the town and bannerworth hall his pursuers for they assumed that character when they saw this became anxious to intercept him  and thinking that the greater force they had the better  they called out aloud as they passed a smithy  where a man was shoeing a horse jack burdon  here is another vampyre the deuce there is  said the person who was addressed  i ll soon settle him  here s my wife gets no sleep of a night as it is  all owing to that varney  who has been plaguing us so long  i won t put up with another so saying  he snatched from a hook on which it hung  an old fowling piece  and joined the pursuit  which now required to be conducted with some celerity  for the stranger had struck into the open country  and was getting on at good speed the last remnants of the twilight were fading away  and although the moon had actually risen  its rays were obscured by a number of light fleecy clouds  which  although they did not promise to be of long continuance  as yet certainly impeded the light where is he going  said the blacksmith  he seems to be making his way towards the mill stream no  said another  don t you see he is striking higher up towards the old ford  where the stepping stones are he is he is  cried the blacksmith  run on run on  don t you see he is crossing it now  tell me  all of you  are you quite sure he is a vampyre  and no mistake  he ain t the exciseman  landlord  now  is he the exciseman  the devil  do you think i want to shoot the exciseman very good then here goes  exclaimed the smith he stooped  and just as the brisk night air blew aside the clouds from before the face of the moon  and as the stranger was crossing the slippery stones  he fired at him                                    how silently and sweetly the moon s rays fall upon the water  upon the meadows  and upon the woods  the scenery appeared the work of enchantment  some fairy land  waiting the appearance of its inhabitants no sound met the ear  the very wind was hushed  nothing was there to distract the sense of sight  save the power of reflection this  indeed  would aid the effect of such a scene  a cloudless sky  the stars all radiant with beauty  while the moon  rising higher and higher in the heavens  increasing in the strength and refulgence of her light and dimming the very stars  which seemed to grow gradually invisible as the majesty of the queen of night became more and more manifest the dark woods and the open meadows contrasted more and more strongly like light and shade  the earth and sky were not more distinct and apart  and the ripling stream  that rushed along with all the impetuosity of uneven ground the banks are clothed with verdure  the tall sedges  here and there lined the sides  beds of bulrushes raised their heads high above all else  and threw out their round clumps of blossoms like tufts  and looked strange in the light of the moon here and there  too  the willows bent gracefully over the stream  and their long leaves were wafted and borne up and down by the gentler force of the stream below  the stream widened  and ran foaming over a hard  stony bottom and near the middle is a heap of stones of large stones  that form the bed of the river  from which the water has washed away all earthy particles  and left them by themselves these stones in winter could not be seen  they were all under water  and the stream washed over in a turbulent and tumultuous manner  but now when the water was clear and low  they are many of them positively out of the water  the stream running around and through their interstices the water weeds here and there lying at the top of the stream  and blossoming beautifully the daisy like blossoms danced and waved gently on the moving flood  at the same time they shone in the moonlight  like fairy faces rising from the depths of the river  to receive the principle of life from the moon s rays tis sweet to wander in the moonlight at such an hour  and it is sweet to look upon such a scene with an unruffled mind  and to give way to the feelings that are engendered by a walk by the river side see  the moon is rising higher and higher  the shadows grow shorter and shorter  the river  which in places was altogether hidden by the tall willow trees  now gradually becomes less and less hidden  and the water becomes more and more lit up the moonbeams play gracefully on the rippling surface  here and there appearing like liquid silver  that each instant changed its position and surface exposed to the light such a moment such a scene  were by far too well calculated to cause the most solemn and serious emotions of the mind  and he must have been but at best insensible  who could wander over meadow and through grove and yet remain untouched by the scene of poetry and romance in which he breathed and moved at such a time  and in such a place  the world is alive with all the finer essences of mysterious life  tis at such an hour that the spirits quit their secret abodes  and visit the earth  and whirl round the enchanted trees tis now the spirits of earth and air dance their giddy flight from flower to flower  tis now they collect and exchange their greetings the wood is filled with them  the meadows teem with them  the hedges at the river side have them hidden among the deep green leaves and blades but what is that yonder  on the stones  partially out of the water what can it be  the more it is looked at  the more it resembles the human form and yet it is still and motionless on the hard stones and yet it is a human form  the legs are lying in the water  the arms appear to be partially in and partially out  they seem moved by the stream now and then  but very gently so slightly  indeed  that it might well be questioned if it moved at all the moon s rays had not yet reached it  the bank on the opposite side of the stream was high  and some tall trees rose up and obscured the moon but she was rising higher and higher each moment  and  finally  when it has reached the tops of those trees  then the rays will reach the middle of the river  and then  by degrees  it will reach the stones in the river  and  finally  the body that lies there so still and so mysteriously how it came there it would be difficult to say  it appeared as though when the waters were high  the body had floated down  and  at the subsidence of the waters  it had been left upon the stones  and now it was exposed to view it was strange and mysterious  and those who might look upon such a sight would feel their blood chill  and their body creep  to contemplate the remains of humanity in such a place  and in such a condition as that must be in a human life had been taken  how  who could tell  perhaps accident alone was the cause of it  perhaps some one had taken a life by violent means and thrown the body in the waters to conceal the fact and the crime the waters had brought it down  and deposited it there in the middle of the river  without any human creature being acquainted with the fact but the moon rises the beams come trembling through the tree tops and straggling branches  and fall upon the opposite bank  and there lies the body  mid stream  and in comparative darkness by the time the river is lit up by the moon s rays  then the object on the stones will be visible  then it can be ascertained what appears now only probable  namely  is the dark object a human form or not in the absence of light it appears to be so  but when the flood of silver light falls upon it  it would be placed then beyond a doubt the time is approaching the moon each moment approaches her meridian and each moment do the rays increase in number and in strength  while the shadows shorten the opposite bank each moment becomes more and more distinct  and the side of the stream  the green rushes and sedges  all by degrees come full into view now and then a fish leaps out of the stream  and just exhibits itself as much as to say  there are things living in the stream  and i am one of them the moment is one of awe the presence of that mysterious and dreadful looking object  even while its identity remains doubt  chills the heart it contracts the expanding thoughts to that one object all interest in the scene lies centered in that one point what could it be  what else but a human body  what else could assume such a form  but see  nearly half the stream is lit by the moonbeams struggling through the tree tops  and now rising above them  the light increases  and the shadows shorten the edge of the bed of stones now becomes lit up by the moonlight  the rippling stream  the bubbles  and the tiny spray that was caused by the rush of water against the stones  seemed like sparkling flashes of silver fire then came the moonbeams upon the body  for it was raised above the level of the water  and shewed conspicuously  for the moonbeams reached the body before they fell on the surrounding water  for that reason then it was the body presented a strange and ghastly object against a deep  dark background  by which it was surrounded but this did not last long the water in another minute was lit up by the moon s pale beams  and then indeed could be plainly enough seen the body of a man lying on the heap of stones motionless and ghastly the colourless hue of the moonlight gave the object a most horrific and terrible appearance  the face of the dead man was turned towards the moon s rays  and the body seemed to receive all the light that could fall upon it it was a terrible object to look upon  and one that added a new and singular interest to the scene  the world seemed then to be composed almost exclusively of still life  and the body was no impediment to the stillness of the scene it was  all else considered  a calm  beautiful scene  lovely the night gorgeous the silvery rays that lit up the face of nature  the hill and dale  meadow  and wood  and river  all afforded contrasts strong striking  and strange but strange  and more strange than any contrast in nature  was that afforded to the calm beauty of the night and place by the deep stillness and quietude imposed upon the mind by that motionless human body the moon s rays now fell upon its full length  the feet were lying in the water  the head lay back  with its features turned towards the quarter of the heavens where the moon shone from  the hair floated on the shallow water  while the face and body were exposed to all influences  from its raised and prominent position the moonbeams had scarcely settled upon it scarce a few minutes when the body moved  was it the water that moved it  it could not be  surely that the moonbeams had the power of recalling life into that inanimate mass  that lay there for some time still and motionless as the very stones on which it lay it was endued with life  the dead man gradually rose up  and leaned himself upon his elbow  he paused a moment like one newly recalled to life  he seemed to become assured he did live  he passed one hand through his hair  which was wet  and then rose higher into a sitting posture  and then he leaned on one hand  inclining himself towards the moon his breast heaved with life  and a kind of deep inspiration  or groan came from him  as he first awoke to life  and then he seemed to pause for a few moments  he turned gradually over  till his head inclined down the stream just below  the water deepened  and ran swiftly and silently on amid meads and groves of trees  the vampyre was revived  he awoke again to a ghastly life  he turned from the heap of stones  he gradually allowed himself to sink into deep water  and then  with a loud plunge  he swam to the centre of the river slowly and surely did he swim into the centre of the river  and down the stream he went  he took long  but easy strokes  for he was going down the stream  and that aided him for some distance might he be heard and seen through the openings in the trees  but he became gradually more and more indistinct  till sound and sight both ceased  and the vampyre had disappeared during the continuance of this singular scene  not one word had passed between the landlord and his companions  when the blacksmith fired the fowling piece  and saw the stranger fall  apparently lifeless  upon the stepping stones that crossed the river  he became terrified at what he had done  and gazed upon the seeming lifeless form with a face on which the utmost horror was depicted they all seemed transfixed to the spot  and although each would have given worlds to move away  a kind of nightmare seemed to possess them which stunned all their faculties  and brought over them a torpidity from which they found it impossible to arouse themselves but  when the apparently dead man moved again  and when  finally  the body  which appeared so destitute of life  rolled into the stream  and floated away with the tide  their fright might be considered to have reached its climax  the absence of the body  however  had seemingly  at all events  the effect of releasing them from the mental and physical thraldom in which they were  and they were enabled to move from the spot  which they did immediately  making their way towards the town with great speed as they got near  they held a sort of council of war as to what they should do under the circumstances  the result of which was  that they came to a conclusion to keep all that they had done and seen to themselves  for  if they did not  they might be called upon for some very troublesome explanations concerning the fate of the supposed hungarian nobleman whom they had taken upon themselves to believe was a vampyre  and to shoot accordingly  without taking the trouble to inquire into the legality of such an act how such a secret was likely to be kept  when it was shared amongst seven people  it is hard to say  but  if it were so kept  it could only be under the pressure of a strong feeling of self preservation they were forced individually  of course  to account for their absence during the night at their respective homes  and how they managed to do that is best known to themselves as to the landlord  he felt compelled to state that  having his suspicions of his guest aroused  he followed him on a walk that he pretended to take  and he had gone so far  that at length he had given up the chase  and lost his own way in returning thus was it  then  that this affair still preserved all its mystery with a large superadded amount of fear attendant upon it  for  if the mysterious guest were really anything supernatural  might he not come again in a much more fearful shape  and avenge the treatment he had received the only person who fell any disappointment in the affair  or whose expectations were not realised  was the boy who had made the appointment with the supposed vampyre at the end of the lane  and who was to have received what he considered so large a reward for pointing out the retreat of sir francis varney he waited in vain for the arrival of the hungarian nobleman  and  at last  indignation got the better of him  and he walked away  feeling that he had been jilted  he resolved to proceed to the public house and demand the half crowns which had been so liberally promised him  but when he reached there he found that the party whom he sought was not within  nor the landlord either  for that was the precise time when that worthy individual was pursuing his guest over meadow and bill  through brake and through briar  towards the stepping stones on the river what the boy further did on the following day  when he found that he was to reap no more benefit for the adventure  we shall soon perceive as for the landlord  he did endeavour to catch a few hours  brief repose  but as he dreamed that the hungarian nobleman came in the likeness of a great toad  and sat upon his chest  feeling like the weight of a mountain  while he  the landlord  tried to scream and cry for help  but found that he could neither do one thing nor the other  we may guess that his repose did not at all invigorate him as he himself expressed it  he got up all of a shake  with a strong impression that he was a very ill used individual  indeed  to have had the nightmare in the day time and now we will return to the cottage where the bannerworth family were at all events  making themselves quite as happy as they did at their ancient mansion  in order to see what is there passing  and how dr chillingworth made an effort to get up some evidence of something that the bannerworth family knew nothing of  therefore could not very well be expected to render him much assistance  that he did  however  make what he considered an important discovery  we shall perceive in the course of the ensuing chapter  in which it will be seen that the best hidden things will  by the merest accident  sometimes come to light  and that too  when least expected by any one at all connected with the result chapter lxxxvi the discovery of the pocket book of marmaduke bannerworth its mysterious contents illustration the little episode had just taken place which we have recorded between the old admiral and jack pringle  when henry bannerworth and charles holland stepped aside to converse charles  said henry  it has become absolutely necessary that i should put an end to this state of dependence in which we all live upon your uncle  it is too bad to think  that because  through fighting the battles of his country  he has amassed some money  we are to eat it up my dear friend  said charles  does it not strike you  that it would be a great deal worse than too bad  if my uncle could not do what he liked with his own yes  but  charles  that is not the question i think it is  though i know not what other question you can make of it we have all talked it over  my mother  my brother  and flora  and my brother and i have determined  if this state of things should last much longer  to find out some means of honourable exertion by which we may at all events  maintain ourselves without being burdensome to any well  well  we will talk of that another time nay  but hear me  we were thinking that if we went into some branch of the public service  your uncle would have the pleasure  such we are quite sure it would be to him  of assisting us greatly by his name and influence well  well  henry  that s all very well  but for a little time do not throw up the old man and make him unhappy  i believe i am his only relative in the world  and  as he has often said  he intended leaving me heir to all he possesses  you see there is no harm done by you receiving a small portion of it beforehand and  said henry  by that line of argument  we are to find an excuse for robbing your uncle  in the fact  that we are robbing you likewise no  no  indeed  you do not view the matter rightly well  all i can say is  charles  that while i feel  and while we all feel  the deepest debt of gratitude towards your uncle  it is our duty to do something  in a box which we have brought with us from the hall and which has not been opened since our father s death  i have stumbled over some articles of ancient jewellery and plate  which  at all events will produce something but which you must not part with nay  but  charles  these are things i knew not we possessed  and most ill suited do they happen to be to our fallen fortunes  it is money we want  not the gewgaws of a former state  to which we can have now no sort of pretension nay  i know you have all the argument  but still is there something sad and uncomfortable to one s feelings in parting with such things as those which have been in families for many years but we knew not that we had them  remember that  charles  come and look at them  those relics of a bygone age may amuse you  and  as regards myself  there are no circumstances whatever associated with them that give them any extrinsic value  so laugh at them or admire them  as you please  i shall most likely be able to join with you in either feeling well  be it so i will come and look at them  but you must think better of what you say concerning my uncle  for i happen to know which you ought likewise by this time how seriously the old man would feel any rejection on your part of the good he fancies he is doing you  i tell you  henry  it is completely his hobby  and let him have earned his money with ten times the danger he has  he could not spend it with anything like the satisfaction that he does  unless he were allowed to dispose of it in this way well  well  be it so for a time the fact is  his attachment to flora is so great which is a most fortunate circumstance for me that i should not be at all surprised that she cuts me out of one half my estate  when the old man dies  but come  we will look at your ancient bijouterie henry led charles into an apartment of the cottage where some of the few things had been placed that were brought from bannerworth hall  which were not likely to be in constant and daily use among these things happened to be the box which henry had mentioned  and from which he had taken a miscellaneous assortment of things of an antique and singular character there were old dresses of a season and of a taste long gone by  ancient articles of defence  some curiously wrought daggers  and a few ornaments  pretty  but valueless  along with others of more sterling pretensions  which henry pointed out to charles i am almost inclined to think  said the latter  that some of these things are really of considerable value  but i do not i profess to be an accurate judge  and  perhaps  i am more taken with the beauty of an article  than the intrinsic worth  what is that which you have just taken from the box it seems a half mask  said henry  made of silk  and here are initial letters within it m  b to what do they apply marmaduke bannerworth  my father i regret i asked you nay  charles  you need not  years have now elapsed since that misguided man put a period to his own existence  in the gardens of bannerworth hall  of course  the shock was a great one to us all  although i must confess that we none of us knew much of a father s affections  but time reconciles one to these dispensations  and to a friend  like yourself  i can talk upon these subjects without a pang he laid down the mask  and proceeded further in his search in the old box towards the bottom of it there were some books  and  crushed in by the side of them  there was an ancient looking pocket book  which charles pointed out  saying there  henry  who knows but you may find a fortune when you least expect it those who expect nothing  said henry  will not be disappointed  at all events  as regards this pocket book  you see it is empty not quite  a card has fallen from it charles took up the card  and read upon it the name of count barrare that name  he said  seems familiar to me  ah  now i recollect  i have read of such a man  he flourished some twenty  or five and twenty years ago  and was considered a roue  of the first water a finished gamester  and  in a sort of brief memoir i read once of him  it said that he disappeared suddenly one day  and was never again heard of indeed  i m not puzzled to think how his card came into my father s pocket book  they met at some gaming house  and  if some old pocket book of the count barrare s were shaken  there might fall from it a card with the name of mr  marmaduke bannerworth upon it is there nothing further in the pocket book no memoranda i will look  stay  here is something upon one of the leaves let me see mem  twenty five thousand pounds  he who robs the robber  steals little  it was not meant to kill him  but it will be unsafe to use the money for a time my brain seems on fire the remotest hiding place in the house is behind the picture what do you think of that  said charles i know not what to think  there is one thing though  that i do know and what is that it is my father s handwriting  i have many scraps of his  and his peculiar hand is familiar to me it s very strange  then  what it can refer to charles charles  there is a mystery connected with our fortunes  that i never could unravel  and once or twice it seemed as if we were upon the point of discovering all  but something has ever interfered to prevent us  and we have been thrown back into the realms of conjecture my father s last words were  the money is hidden  and then he tried to add something  but death stopped his utterance  now  does it not almost seem that this memorandum alluded to the circumstance it does  indeed and then  scarcely had my father breathed his last  when a man comes and asks for him at the garden gate  and  upon hearing that he is dead utters some imprecations  and walks away well  henry  you must trust to time and circumstances to unravel these mysteries  for myself  i own that i cannot do so  i see no earthly way out of the difficulty whatever  but still it does appear to me as if dr chillingworth knew something or had heard something  with which he really ought to make you acquainted do not blame the worthy doctor  he may have made an error of judgment but never one of feeling  and you may depend  if he is keeping anything from me  that he is doing so from some excellent motive  most probably because he thinks it will give me pain  and so will not let me endure any unhappiness from it  unless he is quite certain as regards the facts  when he is so  you may depend he will be communicative  and i shall know all that he has to relate  but  charles  it is evident to me that you  too  are keeping something i yes  you acknowledge to having had an interview  and a friendly one with varney  and you likewise acknowledge that he had told you things which he has compelled you to keep secret i have promised to keep them secret  and i deeply regret the promise that i have made  there cannot be anything to my mind more essentially disagreeable than to have one s tongue tied in one s interview with friends  i hate to hear anything that i may not repeat to those whom i take into my own confidence i can understand the feeling  but here comes the worthy doctor show him the memorandum i will as dr  chillingworth entered the apartments henry handed him the memorandum that had been found in the old pocket book  saying as he did so look at that  doctor  and give us your candid opinion upon it dr  chillingworth fitted on his spectacles  and read the paper carefully  at its conclusion  he screwed up his mouth into an extremely small compass  and doubling up the paper  he put it into his capacious waistcoat pocket  saying as he did so oh  oh  oh  oh  hum well  doctor  said henry  we are waiting for your opinion my opinion  well  then  my dear boy  i must say  my opinion  to the best of my belief is  that i really don t know anything about it then  perhaps  you ll surrender us the memorandum  said charles because  if you don t know anything  we may as well make a little inquiry ha  said the worthy doctor  we can t put old heads upon young shoulders  that s quite clear  now  my good young men  be patient and quiet  recollect  that what you know you re acquainted with  and that that which is hidden from you  you cannot very well come to any very correct conclusion upon  there s a right side and a wrong one you may depend  to every question  and he who walks heedlessly in the dark  is very apt to run his head against a post  good evening  my boys good evening away bustled the doctor well  said charles  what do you think of that  mr  henry i think he knows what he s about that may be  but i ll be hanged if anybody else does  the doctor is by no means favourable to the march of popular information  and i really think he might have given us some food for reflection  instead of leaving us so utterly and entirely at fault as he has  and you know he s taken away your memorandum even let him have it  charles let him have it  it is safe with him  the old man may be  and i believe is  a little whimsical and crotchety  but he means abundantly well  and he s just one of those sort of persons  and always was  who will do good his own way  or not at all  so we must take the good with the bad in those cases  and let dr  chillingworth do as he pleases i cannot say it is nothing to me  although those words were rising to my lips  because you know  henry  that everything which concerns you or yours is something to me  and therefore it is that i feel extremely anxious for the solution of all this mystery  before i hear the sequel of that which varney  the vampyre  has so strongly made me a confidant of  i will  at all events  make an effort to procure his permission to communicate it to all those who are in any way beneficially interested in the circumstances  should he refuse me that permission  i am almost inclined myself to beg him to withhold his confidence nay  do not do so  charles do not do that  i implore you  recollect although you cannot make us joint recipients with you in your knowledge you can make use of it  probably  to our advantage  in saving us perchance  from the different consequences  so that you can make what you know in some way beneficial to us  although not in every way there is reason in that  and i give in at once  be it so  henry  i will wait on him  and if i cannot induce him to change his determination  and allow me to tell some other as well as flora  i must give in  and take the thing as a secret  although i shall not abandon a hope  even after he has told me all he has to tell  that i may induce him to permit me to make a general confidence  instead of the partial one he has empowered me to do it may be so  and  at all events  we must not reject a proffered good because it is not quite so complete as it might be you are right  i will keep my appointment with him  entertaining the most sanguine hope that our troubles and disasters i say our  because i consider myself quite associated in thought  interest  and feelings with your family may soon be over heaven grant it may be so  for your s and flora s sake  but i feel that bannerworth hall will never again be the place it was to us  i should prefer that we sought for new associations  which i have no doubt we may find  and that among us we get up some other home that would be happier because not associated with so many sad scenes in our history be it so  and i am sure that the admiral would gladly give way to such an arrangement  he has often intimated that he thought bannerworth hall a dull place  consequently  although he pretends to have purchased it of you  i think he will be very glad to leave it illustration be it so  then  if it should really happen that we are upon the eve of any circumstances that will really tend to relieve us from our misery and embarrassments  we will seek for some pleasanter abode than the hall  which you may well imagine  since it became the scene of that dreadful tragedy that left us fatherless  has borne but a distasteful appearance to all our eyes i don t wonder at that  and am only surprised that  after such a thing had happened any of you liked to inhabit the place we did not like  but our poverty forced us  you have no notion of the difficulties through which we have struggled  and the fact that we had a home rent free was one of so much importance to us  that had it been surrounded by a thousand more disagreeables than it was  we must have put up with it  but now that we owe so much to the generosity of your uncle  i suppose we can afford to talk of what we like and of what we don t like you can  henry  and it shall not be my fault if you do not always afford to do so  and now  as the time is drawing on  i think i will proceed at once to varney  for it is better to be soon than late  and get from him the remainder of his story                                    there were active influences at work  to prevent sir francis varney from so quickly as he had arranged to do  carrying out his intention of making charles holland acquainted with the history of the eventful period of his life  which had been associated with marmaduke bannerworth one would have scarcely thought it possible that anything now would have prevented varney from concluding his strange narrative  but that he was prevented  will appear the boy who had been promised such liberal payment by the hungarian nobleman  for betraying the place of varney s concealment  we have already stated  felt bitterly the disappointment of not being met according to promise  at the corner of the lane  by that individual it not only deprived him of the half crowns  which already in imagination he had laid out  but it was a great blow to his own importance  for after his discovery of the residence of the vampyre  he looked upon himself as quite a public character  and expected great applause for his cleverness but when the hungarian nobleman came not  all these dreams began to vanish into thin air  and  like the unsubstantial fabric of a vision  to leave no trace behind them he got dreadfully aggravated  and his first thought was to go to varney and see what he could get from him  by betraying the fact that some one was actively in search of him that seemed  however  a doubtful good  and perhaps there was some personal dread of the vampyre mixed up with the rejection of this proposition  but reject it he did  and then he walked moodily into the town without any fixed resolution of what he should do all that he thought of was a general idea that he should like to create some mischief  if possible what it was he cared not  so long as it made a disturbance now  he knew well that the most troublesome and fidgetty man in the town was tobias philpots  a saddler  who was always full of everybody s business but his own  and ever ready to hear any scandal of his neighbours i have a good mind  said the boy  to go to old philpots  and tell him all about it  that i have the good mind soon strengthened itself into a fixed resolution  and full of disdain and indignation at the supposed want of faith of the hungarian nobleman  he paused opposite the saddler s door could he but for a moment have suspected the real reason why the appointment had not been kept with him  all his curiosity would have been doubly aroused  and he would have followed the landlord of the inn and his associate upon the track of the second vampyre that had visited the town but of this he knew nothing  for that proceeding had been conducted with amazing quietness  and the fact of the hungarian nobleman  when he found that he was followed  taking a contrary course to that in which varney was concealed  prevented the boy from knowing anything of his movements hence the thing looked to him like a piece of sheer neglect and contemptuous indifference  which he felt bound to resent he did not pause long at the door of the saddler s  but  after a few moments  he walked boldly in  and said master philpots  i have got something extraordinary to tell you  and you may give me what you like for telling you go on  then  said the saddler  that s just the price i always likes to pay for everything will you keep it secret  said the boy of course i will  when did you ever hear of me telling anything to a single individual never to a single individual  but i have heard you tell things to the whole town confound your impudence  get out of my shop directly oh  very good  i can go and tell old mitchell  the pork butcher no  i say stop  don t tell him  if anybody is to know  let it be me and i ll promise you i ll keep it secret very good  said the boy  returning  you shall know it  and  mind  you have promised me to keep it secret  so that if it gets known  you know it cannot be any fault of mine the fact was  the boy was anxious it should be known  only that in case some consequences might arise  he thought he would quiet his own conscience  by getting a promise of secrecy from tobias philpots  which he well knew that individual would not think of keeping he then related to him the interview he had had with the hungarian nobleman at the inn  how he had promised a number of half crowns  but a very small instalment of which he had received all this master philpots cared very little for  but the information that the dreaded varney  the vampyre  was concealed so close to the town was a matter of great and abounding interest  and at that part of the story he suddenly pricked up his ears amazingly why  you don t mean to say that  he exclaimed  are you sure it was he yes  i am quite certain  i have seen i him more than once  it was sir francis varney  without any mistake why  then you may depend he s only waiting until it s very dark  and then he will walk into somebody  and suck his blood  here s a horrid discovery  i thought we had had enough of master varney  and that he would hardly show himself here again  and now you tell me he is not ten minutes  walk off it s a fact  said the boy  i saw him go in  and he looks thinner and more horrid than ever  i am sure he wants a dollop of blood from somebody i shouldn t wonder now there is mrs  philpots  you know  sir  she s rather big  and seems most ready to burst always  i shouldn t wonder if the vampyre came to her to night wouldn t you  said mrs  philpots  who had walked into the shop  and overheard the whole conversation  wouldn t you  really  i ll vampyre you  and teach you to make these remarks about respectable married women  you young wretch  take that  will you she gave the boy such a box on the ears  that the place seemed to spin round with him  as soon as he recovered sufficiently to be enabled to walk  he made his way from the shop with abundance of precipitation much regretting that he had troubled himself to make a confidant of master philpots but  however  he could not but tell himself that if his object was to make a general disturbance through the whole place  he had certainly succeeded in doing so he slunk home perhaps with a feeling that he might be called upon to take part in something that might ensue  and at all events be compelled to become a guide to the place of sir francis varney s retreat  in which case  for all he knew  the vampyre might  by some more than mortal means  discover what a hand he had had in the matter  and punish him accordingly the moment he hid left the saddler s mrs  philpots  after using some bitter reproaches to her husband for not at once sacrificing the boy upon the spot for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of her  hastily put on her bonnet and shawl  and the saddler  although it was a full hour before the usual time  began putting up the shutters of his shop why  my dear  he said to mrs  philpots  when she came down stairs equipped for the streets  why  my dear  where are you going and pray  sir  what are you shutting up the shop for at this time of the evening oh  why  the fact is  i thought i d just go to the rose and crown  and mention that the vampyre was so near at hand well  mr  philpots  and in that case there can be no harm in my calling upon some of my acquaintance and mentioning it likewise why  i don t suppose there would be much harm  only remember  mrs philpots  remember if you please remember what to tell everybody to keep it secret oh  of course i will  and mind you do it likewise most decidedly the shop was closed  mr  philpots ran off to the rose and crown  and mrs  philpots  with as much expedition as she could  purposed making the grand tour of all her female acquaintance in the town  just to tell them  as a great secret  that the vampyre  sir francis varney  as he called himself  had taken refuge at the house that was to let down the lane leading to higgs s farm but by no means  she said  let it go no further  because it is a very wrong thing to make any disturbance  and you will understand that it s quite a secret she was listened to with breathless attention  as may well be supposed and it was a singular circumstance that at every house she left some other lady put on her bonnet and shawl  and ran out to make the circle of her acquaintance  with precisely the same story  and precisely the same injunctions to secrecy and  as mr  philpots pursued an extremely similar course  we are not surprised that in the short space of one hour the news should have spread through all the town  and that there was scarcely a child old enough to understand what was being talked about  who was ignorant of the fact  that sir francis varney was to be found at the empty house down the lane it was an unlucky time  too  for the night was creeping on  a period at which people s apprehension of the supernatural becomes each moment stronger and more vivid a period at which a number of idlers are let loose for different employments  and when anything in the shape of a row or a riot presents itself in pleasant colours to those who have nothing to lose and who expect  under the cover of darkness  to be able to commit outrages they would be afraid to think of in the daytime  when recognition would be more easy thus was it that sir francis varney s position  although he knew it not became momentarily one of extreme peril  and the danger he was about to run  was certainly greater than any he had as yet experienced  had charles holland but known what was going on  he would undoubtedly have done something to preserve the supposed vampyre from the mischief that threatened him  but the time had not arrived when he had promised to pay him a second visit  so he had no idea of anything serious having occurred perhaps  too  mr  and mrs  philpots scarcely anticipated creating so much confusion  but when they found that the whole place was in an uproar  and that a tumultuous assemblage of persons called aloud for vengeance upon varney  the vampyre  they made their way home again in no small fright and  now  what was the result of all these proceedings will be best known by our introducing the reader to the interior of the house in which varney had found a temporary refuge  and following in detail his proceedings as he waited for the arrival of charles holland chapter lxxxvii the hunt for varney the house tops the miraculous escape the last place of refuge the cottage illustration on the tree tops the moon shines brightly  and the long shadows are shooting its rays down upon the waters  and the green fields appear clothed in a flood of silver light  the little town was quiet and tranquil nature seemed at rest the old mansion in which sir francis varney had taken refuge  stood empty and solitary  it seemed as though it were not associated with the others by which it was surrounded  it was gloomy  and in the moonlight it reminded one of things long gone by  existences that had once been but now no longer of this present time a mere memento of the past sir francis varney reclined upon the house top  he gazed upon the sky and upon the earth  he saw the calm tranquillity that reigned around and could not but admire what he saw  he sighed  he seemed to sigh  from a pleasure he felt in the fact of his security  he could repose there without fear  and breathe the balmy air that fanned his cheek certainly  he muttered  things might have been worse  but not much worse  however  they might have been much better  the ignorant are away the most to be feared  because they have no guide and no control save what can be exerted over them by their fears and their passions he paused to look again over the scene  and  as far as the eye could reach  and that  moonlight as it was  was many miles  the country was diversified with hill and dale  meadow and ploughed land  the open fields  and the darker woods  and the silvery stream that ran at no great distance  all presented a scene that was well calculated to warm the imagination  and to give the mind that charm which a cultivated understanding is capable of receiving there was but one thing wanted to make such a scene one of pure happiness  and that was all absence of care of fears for the future and the wants of life suddenly there was a slight sound that came from the town  it was very slight  but the ears of sir francis varney were painfully acute of late the least sound that came across him was heard in a moment  and his whole visage was changed to one of listening interest the sound was hushed  but his attention was not lulled  for he had been placed in circumstances that made all his vigilance necessary for his own preservation  hence it was  what another would have passed over  or not heard at all  he both heard and noticed  he was not sure of the nature of the sound  it was so slight and so indistinct there it was again  some persons were moving about in the town  the sounds that came upon the night air seemed to say that there was an unusual bustle in the town  which was  to sir francis varney  ominous in the extreme what could people in such a quiet  retired place require out at such an hour at night  it must be something very unusual something that must excite them to a great degree  and sir francis began to feel very uneasy they surely  he muttered to himself they surely cannot have found out my hiding place  and intend to hunt me from it  the blood thirsty hounds  they are never satisfied  the mischief they are permitted to do on one occasion is but the precursor to another  the taste has caused the appetite for more  and nothing short of his blood can satisfy it the sounds increased  and the noise came nearer and nearer  and it appeared as though a number of men had collected together and were coming towards him  yes  they were coming down the lane towards the deserted mansion where he was for once in his life  sir francis varney trembled  he felt sick at heart  though no man was less likely to give up hope and to despair than he  yet this sign of unrelenting hatred and persecution was too unequivocal and too stern not to produce its effect upon even his mind for he had no doubt but that they were coming with the express purpose of seeking him how they could have found him out was a matter he could not imagine  the bannerworths could not have betrayed him he was sure of that  and yet who could have seen him  so cautious and so careful as he had been  and so very sparing had he lived  because he would not give the slightest cause for all that was about to follow  he hoped to have hidden himself but now he could hear the tramp of men distinctly  and their voices came now on the night air  though it was in a subdued tone  as if they were desirous of approaching unheard and unseen by their victim sir francis varney stirred not from his position  he remained silent and motionless  he appeared not to heed what was going on  perhaps he hoped to see them go by to be upon some false scent  or  if they saw no signs of life  they might leave the place  and go elsewhere hark  they stop at the house they go not by  they seem to pause  and then a thundering knock came at the door  which echoed and re echoed through the empty and deserted house  on the top of which sat  in silent expectation  the almost motionless sir francis varney  the redoubted vampyre the knock which came so loud and so hard upon the door caused sir francis to start visibly  for it seemed his own knell  then  as if the mob were satisfied with their knowledge of his presence  and of their victory  and of his inability to escape them  they sent up a loud shout that filled the whole neighbourhood with its sound it seemed to come from below and around the house  it rose from all sides  and that told sir francis varney that the house was surrounded and all escape was cut off  there was no chance of his being able to rush through such a multitude of men as that which now encircled him with the calmest despair  sir francis varney lay still and motionless on the house top  and listened to the sounds that proceeded from below shout after shout arose on the still  calm air of the night  knock after knock came upon the stout old door  which awakened responsive echoes throughout the house that had for many years lain dormant  and which now seemed disturbed  and resounded in hollow murmurs to the voices from without then a loud voice shouted from below  as if to be heard by any one who might be within sir francis varney  the vampyre  come out and give yourself up at discretion  if we have to search for you  you may depend it will be to punish you  you will suffer by burning  come out and give yourself up there was a pause  and then a loud shout sir francis varney paid no attention to this summons  but sat motionless  on the house top  where he could hear all that passed below in the crowd he will not come out  said one ah  he s much too cunning to be caught in such a trap  why  he knows what you would do with him  he knows you would stake him  and make a bonfire about him so he has no taste for roasting  remarked another  but still  it s no use hiding  we have too many hands  and know the house too well to be easily baffled that may be  and  although he don t like burning  yet we will unearth the old fox  somehow or other  we have discovered his haunt at last  and certainly we ll have him out how shall we get in knock in the door break open the door  the front door that is the best  because it leads to all parts of the house  and we can secure any one who attempts to move from one to the other  as they come down hurrah  shouted several men in the crowd hurrah  echoed the mob  with one accord  and the shout rent the air and disturbed the quietude and serenity that scarce five minutes before reigned through the place then  as if actuated by one spirit  they all set to work to force the door in  it was strong  and capable of great defence  and employed them with some labour  for fifteen or twenty minutes  and then  with a loud crash  the door fell in hurrah  again shouted the crowd these shouts announced the fall of the door  and then  and not until then  did sir francis varney stir they have broken in the door  he muttered  well  if die i must  i will sell my life dearly  however  all is not yet lost  and  in the struggle for life  the loss is not so much felt he got up  and crept towards the trap that led into the house  or out of it  as the occasion might require the vampyre  the vampyre  shouted a man who stood on a garden wall holding on by the arm of an apple tree varney  the vampyre  shouted a second hurrah  boys  we are on the right scent  now for a hunt  hurrah  we shall have him now they rushed in a tumultuous riot up the stone steps  and into the hall it was a large  spacious place  with a grand staircase that led up to the upper floor  but it had two ends  and then terminated in a gallery it could not be defended by one man  save at the top  where it could not long be held  because the assailants could unite  and throw their whole weight against the entrance  and thus storm it  this actually happened they looked up  and  seeing nobody  they rushed up  some by one stair and some by the other  but it was dark  there were but few of the moon s rays that pierced the gloom of that place  and those who first reached the place which we have named  were seized with astonishment  staggered and fell sir francis varney had met them  he stood there with a staff something he had found about the house not quite so long as a broom handle  but somewhat thicker and heavier  being made of stout ash this formidable weapon  sir francis varney wielded with strength and resolution  he was a tall man  and one of no mean activity and personal strength  and such a weapon  in his hands  was one of a most fearful character  and  for the occasion  much better than his sword man after man fell beneath the fearful brace of these blows  for though they could not see sir francis  yet he could see them  or the hall lights were behind them at the time  while he stood in the dark and took advantage of this to deal murderous blows upon his assailants this continued for some minutes  till they gave way before such a vigorous defence  and paused on  neighbours  on  cried one  will you be beaten off by one man rush in at once and you must force him from his position push him hard and he must give way ay  said one fellow who sat upon the ground rubbing his head  it s all very well to say push him hard  but if you felt the weight of that d d pole on your head  you wouldn t be in such a blessed hurry however true that might be  there was but little attention paid to it and a determined rush was made at the entrance to the gallery  and they found that it was unoccupied  and that was explained by the slamming of a door  and its being immediately locked upon them  and when the mob came to the door  they found they had to break their way through another door this did not take long in effecting  and in less than five minutes they had broken through that door which led into another room  but the first man who entered it fell from a crashing blow on the head from the ashen staff of sir francis varney  who hurried and fled  closely pursued until he came to another door  through which he dashed here he endeavoured to make a stand and close it  but was immediately struck and grappled with  but he threw his assailant  and turned and fled again his object had been to defend each inch of the ground as long as he was able  but he found they came too close upon his steps  and prevented his turning in time to try the strength of his staff upon the foremost he dashed up the first staircase with surprising rapidity  leaving his pursuers behind  and when he had gained the first landing  he turned upon those who pursued him  who could hardly follow him two abreast down with the vampyre  shouted the first  who rushed up heedless of the staff down with a fool  thundered varney  as he struck the fellow a terrific blow  which covered his face with blood  and he fell back into the arms of his companions a bitter groan and execration arose from them below  and again they shouted  and rushed up headlong down with the vampyre  was again shouted  and met by a corresponding but deep guttural sound of down with a fool and sure enough the first again came to the earth without any preparation  save the application of an ashen stick to his skull  which by the bye  no means aided the operation of thinking several more shared a similar fate  but they pressed hard  and sir francis was compelled to give ground to keep them at the necessary length from him  as they rushed on regardless of his blows  and if he had not he would soon have been engaged in a personal struggle  for they were getting too close for him to use the staff down with the vampyre  was the renewed cry  as they drove him from spot to spot until he reached the roof of the house  and then he ran up the steps to the loft  which he had just reached when they came up to the bottom varney attempted to draw the ladder up but four or five stout men held that down  then by a sudden turn  as they were getting up  he turned it over  threw those on it down  and the ladder too  upon the heads of those who were below down with the vampyre  shouted the mob  as they  with the most untiring energy  set the ladder  or steps  against the loft  and as many as could held it  while others rushed up to attack varney with all the ferocity and courage of so many bull dogs it was strange  but the more they were baffled the more enraged and determined they rushed on to a new attack  with greater resolution than ever on this occasion  however  they were met with a new kind of missile  for sir francis had either collected and placed there for the occasion  or they had been left there for years  a number of old bricks  which lay close at hand  these he took  one by one  and deliberately took aim at them  and flung them with great force  striking down every one they hit this caused them to recoil  the bricks caused fearful gashes in their heads  and the wounds were serious  the flesh being  in many places torn completely off  they however  only paused  for one man said be of good heart  comrades  we can do as he does  he has furnished us with weapons  and we can thus attack him in two ways  and he must give way in the end hurrah  down with the vampyre  sounded from all sides  and the shout was answered by a corresponding rush it was true  sir francis had furnished them with weapons to attack himself  for they could throw them back at him  which they did  and struck him a severe blow on the head  and it covered his face with blood in a moment hurrah  shouted the assailants  another such a blow  and all will be over with the vampyre he s got press him sharp  now  cried another man  as he aimed another blow with a brick  which struck varney on the arm  causing him to drop the brick he held in his hand  he staggered back  apparently in great pain up  up  we have him now  he cannot get away  he s hurt  we have him we have him and up they went with all the rapidity they could scramble up the steps but this had given varney time to recover himself  and though his right arm was almost useless  yet he contrived  with his left  to pitch the bricks so as to knock over the first three or four  when  seeing that he could not maintain his position to advantage  he rushed to the outside of the house  the last place he had capable of defence there was a great shout by those outside  when they saw him come out and stand with his staff  and those who came first got first served  for the blows resounded  while he struck them  and sent them over below then came a great shout from within and without  and then a desperate rush was made at the door  and  in the next instant  varney was seen flying  followed by his pursuers  one after the other  some tumbling over the tiles  to the imminent hazard of their necks sir francis varney rushed along with a speed that appeared by far too great to admit of being safely followed  and yet those who followed appeared infected by his example  and appeared heedless of all consequences by which their pursuit might be attended to themselves hurrah  shouted the mob below hurrah  answered the mob on the tiles then  over several housetops might be seen the flying figure of sir francis varney  pursued by different men at a pace almost equal to his own they  however  could keep up the same speed  and not improve upon it while he kept the advantage he first obtained in the start then suddenly he disappeared it seemed to the spectators below that he had dropped through a house and they immediately surrounded the house  as well as they could  and then set up another shout this took place several times  and as often was the miserable man hunted from his place of refuge only to seek another  from which he was in like manner hunted by those who thirsted for his blood on one occasion  they drove him into a house which was surrounded  save at one point  which had a long room  or building in it  that ran some distance out  and about twenty feet high at the entrance to the roof of this place  or leads  he stood and defended himself for some moments with success  but having received a blow himself  he was compelled to retire  while the mob behind forced those in front forward faster than he could by any exertion wield the staff that had so much befriended him on this occasion he was  therefore  on the point of being overwhelmed by numbers  when he fled  but  alas  there was no escape  a bare coping stone and rails ran round the top of that there was not much time for hesitation  but he jumped over the rails and looked below  it was a great height  but if he fell and hurt himself  he knew he was at the mercy of the bloodhounds behind him  who would do anything but show him any mercy  or spare him a single pang he looked round and beheld his pursuers close upon him  and one was so close to him that he seized upon his arm  saying  as he shouted to his companions hurrah  boys  i have him with an execration  sir francis wielded his staff with such force  that he struck the fellow on the head  crushing in his hat as if it had been only so much paper  the man fell  but a blow followed from some one else which caused varney to relax his hold  and finding himself falling  he to save himself  sprang away the rails  at that moment  were crowded with men who leaned over to ascertain the effect of the leap he ll be killed  said one he s sure to be smashed  said another i ll lay any wager he ll break a limb  said a third varney came to the earth for a moment he lay stunned  and not able to move hand or foot hurrah  shouted the mob their triumph was short  for just as they shouted varney arose  and after a moment or two s stagger he set off at full speed  which produced another shout from the mob  and just at that moment  a body of his pursuers were seen scaling the walls after him there was now a hunt through all the adjoining fields from cover after cover they pursued him until he found no rest from the hungry wolves that beset him with cries  resembling beasts of prey rather than any human multitude sir francis heard them  at the same time  with the despair of a man who is struggling for life  and yet knows he is struggling in vain  he knew his strength was decaying his immense exertions and the blows he had received  all weakened him  while the number and strength of his foes seemed rather to increase than to diminish once more he sought the houses  and for a moment he believed himself safe  but that was only a momentary deception  for they had traced him he arrived at a garden wall  over which he bounded  and then he rushed into the house  the door of which stood open  for the noise and disturbance had awakened most of the inhabitants  who were out in all directions he took refuge in a small closet on the stairs  but was seen to do so by a girl  who screamed out with fear and fright murder  murder the wampyre the wampyre  with all her strength  and in the way of screaming that was no little  and then she went off into a fit this was signal enough  and the house was at once entered  and beset on all sides by the mob  who came impatient of obtaining their victim who had so often baffled them there he is there he is  said the girl  who came to as soon as other people came up where where in that closet  she said  pointing to it with her finger  i see d him go in the way above sir francis  finding himself betrayed  immediately came out of the closet  just as two or three were advancing to open it  and dealt so hard a blow on the head of the first that came near him that he fell without a groan  and a second shared the same fate  and then sir francis found himself grappled with  but with a violent effort he relieved himself and rushed up stairs oh  murder the wampyre  what shall i do fire fire these exclamations were uttered in consequence of varney in his haste to get up stairs  having inadvertently stepped into the girl s lap with one foot  while he kicked her in the chin with the other  besides scratching her nose till it bled after him stick to him  shouted the mob  but the girl kicked and sprawled so much they were impeded  till  regardless of her cries  they ran over her and pursued varney  who was much distressed with the exertions he had made after about a minute s race he turned upon the head of the stair  not so much with the hope of defending it as of taking some breathing time  but seeing his enemies so close  he drew his sword  and stood panting  but prepared never mind his toasting fork  said one bulky fellow  and  as he spoke he rushed on  but the point of the weapon entered his heart and he fell dead there was a dreadful execration uttered by those who came up after him and there was a momentary pause  for none liked to rush on to the bloody sword of sir francis varney  who stood so willing and so capable of using it with the most deadly effect  they paused  as well they might and this pause was the most welcome thing next to life to the unfortunate fugitive  for he was dreadfully distressed and bleeding on to him boys  he can hardly stand  see how he pants  on to him  i say push him hard he pushes hard  i tell you  said another  i felt the point of his sword  as it came through giles s back i ll try my luck  then  said another  and he rushed up  but he was met by the sword of sir francis  who pierced it through his side  and he fell back with a groan sir francis  fearful of stopping any longer to defend that point appeared desirous of making good his retreat with some little advantage and he rushed up stairs before they had recovered from the momentary consternation into which they had been thrown by the sudden disaster they had received illustration but they were quickly after him  and before he  wearied as he was  could gain the roof  they were up the ladder after him the first man who came through the trap was again set upon by varney who made a desperate thrust at him  and it took effect  but the sword snapped by the handle with an execration  sir francis threw the hilt at the head of the next man he saw  then rushing  with headlong speed  he distanced his pursuers for some house tops but the row of houses ended at the one he was then at  and he could go no further  what was to be done  the height was by far too great to be jumped  death was certain  a hideous heap of crushed and mangled bones would be the extent of what would remain of him  and then  perhaps  life not extinct for some hours afterwards he turned round  he saw them coming hallooing over the house tops  like a pack of hounds  sir francis struck his hands together  and groaned  he looked round  and perceived some ivy peeping over the coping stone  a thought struck him  and he instantly ran to the spot and leaned over saved saved  he exclaimed then  placing his hand over  he felt for the ivy  then he got over  and hung by the coping stone  in a perilous position  till he found a spot on which he could rest his foot  and then he grasped the ivy as low down as he could  and thus he lowered himself a short way  till he came to where the ivy was stronger and more secure to the wall  as the upper part was very dangerous with his weight attached to it the mob came on  very sure of having sir francis varney in their power and they did not hurry on so violently  as their position was dangerous at that hour of the night easy  boys  easy  was the cry  the bird is our own  he can t get away  that s very certain they  however  came on  and took no time about it hardly  but what was their amazement and rage at finding he had disappeared where is he  was the universal inquiry  and i don t know  an almost universal answer there was a long pause  while they searched around  but they saw no vestige of the object of their search there s no trap door open  remarked one  and i don t think he could have got in at any one perhaps  finding he could not get away  he has taken the desperate expedient of jumping over  and committing suicide  and so escape the doom he ought to be subjected to probably he has  but then we can run a stake through him and burn him all the same they now approached the extreme verge of the houses  and looked over the sides  but they could see nothing  the moon was up  and there was light enough to have seen him if he had fallen to the earth  and they were quite sure that he could not have got up after such a fall as he must have received we are beaten after all  neighbours i am not so sure of that  was the reply  he may now be hidden about for he was too far spent to be able to go far  he could not do that  i am sure i think not either might he not have escaped by means of that ivy  yonder  said one of the men  pointing to the plant  as it climbed over the coping stones of the wall yes  it may be possible  said one  and yet it is very dangerous  if not certain destruction to get over oh  yes  there is no possibility of escape that way  why  it wouldn t bear a cat  for there are no nails driven into the wall at this height never mind  said another  we may as well leave no stone unturned  as the saying is  but at once set about looking out for him the individual who spoke now leant over the coping stone  for some moments  in silence  he could see nothing  but yet he continued to gaze for some moments do you see him  inquired one no  was the answer ay  ay  i thought as much  was the reply  he might as well have got hold of a corner of the moon  which  i believe  is more likely a great deal more likely hold still a moment  said the man  who was looking over the edge of the house what s the matter now  a gnat flew into your eye no  but i see him by jove  i see him see who see who varney  the vampyre  shouted the man  i see him about half way down clinging  like a fly  to the wall  odd zounds  i never saw the like afore hurrah  after him then  boys not the same way  if you please  go yourself  and welcome  but i won t go that way just as you please  said the man  but what s good for the goose is good for the gander is an old saying  and so is jack as good as his master so it may be  but cuss me if you ain t a fool if you attempt that the man made no reply  but did as varney had done before  got over the coping stone  and then laid hold of the ivy  but  whether his weight was heavier than varney s  or whether it was that the latter had loosened the hold of the ivy or not  but he had no sooner left go of the coping stone than the ivy gave way  and he was precipitated from the height of about fifty feet to the earth a dreadful fall there was a pause no one spoke  the man lay motionless and dead he had dislocated his neck the fall had not  however  been without its effect upon varney  for the man s heels struck him so forcibly on his head as he fell  that he was stunned  and let go his hold  and he  too  fell to the earth  but not many feet he soon recovered himself  and was staggering away  when he was assailed by those above with groans  and curses of all kinds  and then by stones and tiles  and whatever the mob could lay their hands upon some of these struck him  and he was cut about in various places  so that he could hardly stand the hoots and shouts of the mob above had now attracted those below to the spot where sir francis varney was trying to escape  but he had not gone far before the loud yells of those behind him told him that he was again pursued half dead  and almost wholly spent  unarmed  and defenceless  he scarce knew what to do  whether to fly  or to turn round and die as a refuge from the greater evil of endeavouring to prolong a struggle which seemed hopeless  instinct  however  urged him on  at all risks  and though he could not go very far  or fast  yet on he went  with the crowd after him down with the vampyre seize him hold him burn him  he must be down presently  he can t stand this gave them new hopes  and rendered varney s fate almost certain they renewed their exertions to overtake him  while he exerted himself anew  and with surprising agility  considering how he had been employed for more than two hours there were some trees and hedges now that opposed the progress of both parties  the height of sir francis varney gave him a great advantage and  had he been fresh  he might have shown it to advantage in vaulting over the hedges and ditches  which he jumped when obliged  and walked through when he could every now and then  the party in pursuit  who had been behind him some distance  now they gained on him  however  they kept  every now and then  losing sight of him among the trees and shrubs  and he made direct for a small wood  hoping that when there  he should to be able to conceal himself for some time  so as to throw his pursuers off the track they were well aware of this  for they increased their speed  and one or two swifter of foot than the others  got a head of them and cried out aloud as they ran keep up  keep up  he s making for the wood he can t stop there long  there are too many of us to beat that cover without finding our game  push  lads  he s our own now  as sure as we know he s on a head they did push on  and came in full sight as they saw sir francis enter the wood  with what speed he could make  but he was almost spent  this was a cheering sight to them  and they were pretty certain he would not leave the wood in the state he was then he must seek concealment however  they were mistaken  for sir francis varney  as soon as he got into the wood  plunged into the thickest of it  and then paused to gain breath so far safe  he muttered  but i have had a narrow escape  they are not yet done  though  and it will not be safe here long  i must away and seek shelter and safety elsewhere  if i can curses on the hounds that run yelping over the fields he heard the shouts of his pursuers  and prepared to quit the wood when he thought the first had entered it they will remain here some time in beating about  he muttered  that is the only chance i have had since the pursuit  curse them  i say again  i may now get free  this delay must save my life  but nothing else will he moved away  and  at a slow and lazy pace  left the wood  and then made his way across some fields  towards some cottages  that lay on the left the moon yet shone on the fields  he could hear the shouts of the mob as various parties went through the wood from one covert to another  and yet unable to find him then came a great shout upon his ears  as though they had found out he had left the wood  this caused him to redouble his speed  and  fearful lest he should be seen in the moonlight  he leaped over the first fence that he came to  with almost the last effort he could make  and then staggered in at an open door through a passage into a front parlour and there fell  faint  and utterly spent and speechless  at the feet of flora bannerworth chapter lxxxviii the reception of the vampyre by flora varney subdued illustration we must say that the irruption into the house of the bannerworths by sir francis varney  was certainly unpremeditated by him  for he knew not into whose house he had thus suddenly rushed for refuge from the numerous foes who were pursuing him with such vengeful ire  it was a strange and singular incident  and one well calculated to cause the mind to pause before it passed it by  and consider the means to an end which are sometimes as wide of the mark  as it is in nature possible to be but truth is stronger than fiction by far  and the end of it was  that pressed on all sides by danger  bleeding  faint  and exhausted  he rushed into the first house he came to  and thus placed himself in the very house of those whom he had brought to such a state of misfortune flora bannerworth was seated at some embroidery  to pass away an hour or so  and thus get over the tedium of time  she was not thinking  either upon the unhappy past  some trifling object or other engaged her attention  but what was her anguish when she saw a man staggering into the room bleeding  and bearing the marks of a bloody contest  and sinking at her feet her astonishment was far greater yet  when she recognised that man to be sir francis varney save me save me  miss bannerworth  save me only you can save me from the ruthless multitude which follows  crying aloud for my blood as he spoke  he sank down speechless  flora was so much amazed  not to say terrified  that she knew not what to do  she saw sir francis a suppliant at her feet  a fugitive from his enemies  who would show him no mercy she saw all this at a moment s glance  and yet she had not recovered her speech and presence of mind enough to enable her to make any reply to him save me  miss flora bannerworth  save me  he again said  raising himself on his hands  i am beset  hunted like a wild beast they seek my life they have pursued me from one spot to another  and i have unwittingly intruded upon you  you will save me  i am sure your kindness and goodness of heart will never permit me to be turned out among such a crew of blood thirsty butchers as those who pursue me are rise  sir francis varney  said flora  after a moment s hesitation  in such an extremity as that which you are in  it would be inhuman indeed to thrust you out among your enemies oh  it would  said varney  i had thought  until now  i could have faced such a mob  until i was in this extremity  and then  disarmed and thrown down  bruised  beaten  and incapable of stemming such a torrent i fled from one place to another  till hunted from each  and then instinct alone urged me to greater exertion than before  and here i am this is now my last and only hope rise  sir francis you will not let me be torn out and slaughtered like an ox  i am sure you will not sir francis  we are incapable of such conduct  you have sought refuge here  and shall find it as far as we are able to afford it to you and your brother and yes yes all who are here will do the same  but here they come to speak for themselves as she spoke  mrs  bannerworth entered  also charles holland  who both started on seeing the vampyre present  sir francis varney  who was too weak to rise without assistance sir francis varney  said flora  speaking to them as they entered  has sought refuge here  his life is in peril  and he has no other hope left you will  i am sure  do what can be done for him mr  holland  said sir francis  i am  as you may see by my condition a fugitive  and have been beaten almost to death  instinct alone urged me on to save my life  and i  unknowingly  came in here rise  sir francis  said charles holland  i am not one who would feel any pleasure in seeing you become the victim of any brutal mob  i am sure there are none amongst us who would willingly do so  you have trusted to those who will not betray you thank you  said sir francis  faintly  i thank you  your conduct is noble  and miss bannerworth s especially so are you much hurt  sir francis  inquired charles i am much hurt  but not seriously or dangerously  but i am weak and exhausted let me assist you to rise  said charles holland thank you  said sir francis  as he accepted of the assistance  and when he stood up  he found how incapable he really was  for a child might have grappled with him i have been sore beset  mrs  bannerworth  he said  endeavouring to bow to that lady  and i have suffered much ill usage  i am not in such a plight as i could wish to be seen in by ladies  but my reasons for coming will be an excuse for my appearance in such disorder we will not say anything about that  said charles holland  under the circumstances  it could not be otherwise it could not  said sir francis  as he took the chair miss flora bannerworth placed for him i will not ask you for any explanation as to how this came about  but you need some restorative and rest i think i suffer more from exhaustion than anything else  the bruises i have  of course  are not dangerous can you step aside a few moments  said mrs  bannerworth  i will show you where you can remove some of those stains  and make yourself more comfortable thank you  madam thank you  it will be most welcome to me  i assure you sir francis rose up  and  with the aid of charles holland  he walked to the next room  where he washed himself  and arranged his dress as well as it would admit of its being done mr  holland  he said  i cannot tell you how grateful i feel for this i have been hunted from the house where you saw me  from what source they learned my abode my place of concealment i know not  but they found me out i need hardly say  sir francis  that it could not have occurred through me  said charles holland my young friend  said sir francis  i am quite sure you were not  and moreover  i never  for one moment  suspected you  no  no  some accidental circumstance alone has been the cause  i have been very cautious i may say extremely so but at the same time  living  as i have  surrounded by enemies on all sides  it is not to be wondered at that i should be seen by some one  and thus traced to my lair  whither they followed me at their leisure they have been but too troublesome in this matter  when they become a little reasonable  it will be a great miracle  for  when their passions and fears are excited  there is no end to the extremes they will perpetrate it is so  said varney  as the history of these last few days amply testifies to me  i could never have credited the extent to which popular excitement could be carried  and the results it was likely to produce it is an engine of very difficult control  pursued charles holland but what will raise it will not allay it  but add fuel to the fire that burns so fiercely already true enough  said sir francis if you have done  will you again step this way sir francis varney followed charles holland into the sitting room  and sat down with them  and before him was spread a light supper  with some good wine eat  sir francis  said mrs  bannerworth  such a state as that in which you are  must  of necessity  produce great exhaustion  and you must require food and drink sir francis bowed as well as he was able  and even then  sore and bruised as he was  fugitive as he had been  he could not forget his courtesy  but it was not without an effort  his equanimity was  however much disturbed  by finding himself in the midst of the bannerworths i owe you a relation  he said  of what occurred to drive me from my place of concealment we should like to hear it  if you are not too far fatigued to relate it  said charles i will  i was sitting at the top of that house in which i sought to hide myself  when i heard sounds come that were of a very suspicious nature  but did not believe that it could happen that they had discovered my lurking place  far from it  though  of late  i had been habitually cautious and suspicious  yet i thought i was safe  till i heard the noise of a multitude coming towards me  i could not be mistaken in it  for the sounds are so peculiar that they are like nothing else  i heard them coming i moved not  and when they surrounded the house as far as was practicable  they gave an immense shout  and made the welkin ring with the sound i heard a confused noise at a distance  remarked flora  but i had no idea that anything serious was contemplated  i imagined it was some festival among some trade  or portion of the townspeople  who were shouting from joy oh  dear no  said sir francis  but i am not surprised at the mistake because there are such occurrences occasionally  but whenever the mob gained any advantage upon me they shouted  and when i was able to oppose them with effect  they groaned at me most horribly the deuce  said charles  the sound  suppose  serves to express their feelings  and to encourage each other something of the sort  i dare say  said varney  but at length  after defending the house with all the desperation that despair imparted to me  i was compelled to fly from floor to floor  until i had reached the roof  there they followed me  and i was compelled again to fly  house after house they followed me to  until i could go no farther  said varney how did you escape fortunately i saw some ivy growing and creeping over the coping stones and by grasping that i got over the side  and so let myself down by degrees  as well as i was able good heavens  what a dreadful situation  exclaimed flora  it is really horrible i could not do it again  under  i think  any circumstances not the same  said mrs  bannerworth i really doubt if i could  said varney  the truth is  the excitement of the moment was great  and i at that moment thought of nothing but getting away the same circumstances  the same fear of death  could hardly be produced in me again  and i am unable to account for the phenomenon on this occasion your escape was very narrow indeed  said flora  it makes me shudder to think of the dangers you have gone through  it is really terrible to think of it you  said sir francis  are young and susceptible  and generous in your disposition  you can feel for me  and do  but how little i could have expected it  it is impossible to say  but your sympathy sinks into my mind and causes such emotions as never can be erased from my soul but to proceed  you may guess how dreadful was my position  by the fact that the first man who attempted to get over tore the ivy away and fell striking me in his fall  he was killed  and i thrown down and stunned  i then made for the wood  closely pursued and got into it  then i baffled them  they searched the wood  and i went through it  i then ran across the country to these houses here  i got over the fence  and in at the back door did they see you come  inquired charles holland i cannot say  but i think that they did not  i heard them give a loud shout more than once when on this side of the wood you did  how far from here were you when you heard the shouts inquired mrs  bannerworth i was close here  and  as i jumped over the fence  i heard them shout again  but i think they cannot see so far  the night was moonlight  to be sure  but that is all  the shadow of the hedge  and the distance together  would make it  if not impossible  at least very improbable that is very likely  said mrs  bannerworth in that case  said charles holland  you are safe here  for none will suspect your being concealed here it is the last place i should myself have thought of  said varney and i may say the last place i would knowingly have come to  but had i before known enough of you  i should have been well assured of your generosity  and have freely come to claim your aid and shelter  which accident has so strangely brought me to be a candidate for  and which you have so kindly awarded me the night is wearing away  said flora  and sir francis is doubtless fatigued to an excess  sleep  i dare say  will be most welcome to him it will indeed  miss bannerworth  said varney  but i can do that under any circumstances  do not let me put you to any inconvenience  a chair  and at any hour  will serve me for sleep we cannot do for you what we would wish  said flora  looking at her mother  but something better than that  at all events  we can and will provide for you i know not how to thank you  said sir francis varney  i assure you of late i have not been luxuriously lodged  and the less trouble i give you the greater i shall esteem the favour the hour was late  and sir francis varney  before another half hour had elapsed  was consigned to his own reflections  in a small but neat room there to repose his bruised and battered carcass  and court the refreshing influence of sleep his reflections were  for nearly an hour  of the most contradictory character  some one passion was trying to overcome the other  but he seemed quite subdued i could not have expected this  he muttered  flora bannerworth has the soul of a heroine  i deserved not such a reception from them  and yet  in my hour of utmost need  they have received me like a favoured friend  and yet all their misfortunes have taken their origin from me  i am the cause of all filled with these thoughts  he fell asleep  he slept till morning broke he was not disturbed  it seemed as though the influence of sleep was sweeter far there  in the cottage of the bannerworths  than ever he had before received it was late on that morning before sir francis rose  and then only through hearing the family about  and  having performed his toilet  so far as circumstances permitted  he descended  and entered the front parlour  the room he had been in the night before flora bannerworth was already there  indeed  breakfast was waiting the appearance of sir francis varney good morning  miss bannerworth  said sir francis  bowing with his usual dignified manner  but in the kindest and sincerest way he was able to assume good morning  sir francis  said flora  rising to receive him  and she could not avoid looking at him as he entered the room  i hope you have had a pleasant night it has been the best night s rest i have had for some time  miss bannerworth  i assure you i have to express my gratitude to you for so much kindness  i have slept well  and soundly i am glad to hear it i think yet i shall escape the search of these people who have hunted me from so many places i hope you may  indeed  sir francis you  miss bannerworth  and do you hope i may escape the vengeance of these people the populace i do  sir francis  most sincerely hope so  why should i wish evil to you  especially at their hands sir francis did not speak for a minute or two  and then he said  turning full upon flora i don t know why  miss bannerworth  that i should think so  but perhaps it is because there are peculiar circumstances connected with myself that have made me feel conscious that i have not deserved so much goodness at your hands you have not deserved any evil  sir francis  we could not do that if it were in our power  we would do you a service at any time you have done so  miss bannerworth the greatest that can be performed you have saved my life at that moment charles holland entered  and sir francis bowed  as he said i hope you  mr  holland  have slept as well  and passed as good a night as i have passed i am glad you  at least  have passed a quiet one  said charles holland  you  i dare say  feel all the better for it  how do you feel yourself  are you much hurt not at all  not at all  said sir francis varney  only a few bruises and so forth  some of which  as you may perceive  do not add to one s personal appearance  a week or two s quiet would rid me of them  at all events  i would it may do the same with my enemies i wish they were as easily gotten rid of myself  said charles  but as that cannot be  we must endeavour to baffle them in the best way we may i owe a debt to you i shall never be able to repay  but where there is a will  they say there is a way  and if the old saying be good for anything  i need not despair  though the way is by no means apparent at present time is the magician  said flora  whose wand changes all things the young to the aged  and the aged to nothing certainly  that is true  said varney  and many such changes have i seen  my mind is stored with such events  but this is sadness  and i have cause to rejoice    the breakfast was passed off in pleasing conversation  and varney found himself much at home with the bannerworths  whose calm and even tenour was quite new to him he could not but admit the charms of such a life as that led by the bannerworths  but what it must have been when they were supplied by ample means  with nothing to prey upon their minds  and no fearful mystery to hang on and weigh down their spirits  he could scarcely imagine they were amiable  accomplished  they were in the same mind at all times and nothing seemed to ruffle them  and when night came  he could not but acknowledge to himself that he had never formed half the opinion of them they were deserving of of course during that day he was compelled to lie close  so as not to be seen by any one  save the family  he sat in a small room  which was overlooked by no other in the neighbourhood  and he remained quiet sometimes conversing  and sometimes reading  but at the same time ever attentive to the least sound that appeared at all of a character to indicate the approach of persons for any purpose whatever at supper time he spoke to flora and to charles holland  saying there are certain matters connected with myself i may say with you now sure all that has happened will make it so of which you would be glad to hear some thing you mean upon the same subject upon which i had some conversation with you a day or two back yes  the same  allow me one week  and you shall know all  i will then relate to you that which you so much desire to know one week  and all shall be told well  said charles holland  this has not been exacted from you as the price of your safety  but you can choose your own time  of course  what you promise is most desired  for it will render those happy who now are much worse than they were before these occurrences took place i am aware of all that  grant me but one week  and then you shall be made acquainted with all i am satisfied  sir francis  said flora  but while here under our roof  we should never have asked you a question of this  miss bannerworth  the little i have seen of you assures me you would not do so  however  i am the more inclined to make it i am under so deep an obligation to you all  that i can never repay it                                    sir francis varney retired to rest that night his promise to the bannerworths filled his mind with many reflections the insecurity of his own position  and the frail tenure which he even held in the hands of those whom he had most injured this produced a series of reflections of a grave and melancholy nature and he sat by his window  watching the progress of the clouds  as they appeared to chase each other over the face of the scene now casting a shade over the earth  and then banishing the shadows  and throwing a gentle light over the earth s surface  which was again chased away  and shadows again fell upon the scene below how long he had sat there in melancholy musing he knew not  but suddenly he was aroused from his dreams by a voice that shook the skies  and caused him to start to his feet hurrah hurrah hurrah  shouted the mob  which had silently collected around the cottage of the bannerworths curses  muttered sir francis  as he again sank in his chair  and struck his head with his hand  i am hunted to death they will not leave me until my body has graced a cross road hurrah down with the vampyre pull him out then came an instant knocking at the doors  and the people on the outside made so great a din  that it seemed as though they contemplated knocking the house down at once  without warning the inmates that they waited there there was a cessation for about a minute  when one of the family hastened to the door  and inquired what was wanted varney  the vampyre  was the reply you must seek him elsewhere we will search this place before we go further  replied a man but he is not here we have reason to believe otherwise  open the door  and let us in no one shall be hurt  or one single object in the house  but we must come in  and search for the vampyre come to morrow  then that will not do  said the voice  open  or we force our way in without more notice at the same a tremendous blow was bestowed upon the door  and then much force was used to thrust it in  a consultation was suddenly held among the inmates  as to what was to be done  but no one could advise  and each was well aware of the utter impossibility of keeping the mob out i do not see what is to become of me  said sir francis varney suddenly appearing before them  you must let them in  there is no chance of keeping them off  neither can you conceal me  you will have no place  save one  that will be sacred from their profanation and which is that flora s own room all started at the thought that flora s chamber could in any way be profaned by any such presence as sir francis varney s however  the doors below were suddenly burst open  amid loud cries from the populace  who rushed in in great numbers  and began to search the lower rooms  immediately all is lost  said sir francis varney  as he dashed away and rushed to the chamber of flora  who  alarmed at the sounds that were now filling the house  stood listening to them miss bannerworth  began varney sir francis yes  it is indeed i  miss bannerworth  hear me  for one moment what is the matter i am again in peril in more imminent peril than before  my life is not worth a minute s purchase  unless you save me  you  and you alone  can now save me  oh  miss bannerworth  if ever pity touched your heart  save me from those only whom i now fear  i could meet death in any shape but that in which they will inflict it upon me  hear their execrations below death to the vampyre  death to varney  burn him  run a stake through his body illustration what can i do  sir francis admit me to your chamber sir francis  are you aware of what you are saying i am well  it is a request which you would justly scorn to reply to but now my life recollect you have saved me once my life do not now throw away the boon you have so kindly bestowed  save me  miss bannerworth it is not possible  i nay  miss bannerworth  do you imagine this is a time for ceremony  or the observances of polished life  on my honour  you run no risk of censure where is varney  where is the vampyre  he ain t far off hear hear them  miss bannerworth  they are now at the foot of the stairs  not a moment to lose  one minute more  and i am in the hands of a crew that has no mercy hurrah  upstairs  he s not below  upstairs  neighbours  we shall have him yet these words sounded on the stairs  half a dozen more steps  and varney would be seen  it was a miracle he was not heard begging for his life varney cast a look of despair at the stairhead and felt for his sword but it was not there  he had lost it  he struck his head with his clenched hand  and was about to rush upon his foes  when he heard the lock turn  he looked  and saw the door opened gently  and flora stood there  he passed in  and sank cowering into a chair  at the other end of the room  behind some curtains the door was scarcely shut ere some tried to force it  and then a loud knocking came at the door open  open  we want varney  the vampyre  open  or we will burst it open flora did open it  but stood resolutely in the opening  and held up her hand to impose silence are you men  that you can come thus to force yourselves upon the privacy of a female  is there nothing in the town or house  that you must intrude in numbers into a private apartment  is no place sacred from you but  ma am miss we only want varney  the vampyre and can you find him nowhere but in a female s bedroom  shame on you shame on you  have you no sisters  wives  or mothers  that you act thus he s not there  you may be sure of that  jack  said a gruff voice let the lady be in quiet  she s had quite enough trouble with him to sicken her of a vampyre  you may be sure that s the last place to find him in with this they all turned away  and flora shut the door and locked it upon them  and varney was safe you have saved me  said varney hush  said flora  speak not  there maybe some one listening sir francis varney stood in the attitude of one listening most anxiously to catch some sounds  the moon fell across his face  and gave it a ghastly hue  that  added to his natural paleness and wounds  gave him an almost unearthly aspect the sounds grew more and more distant  the shouts and noise of men traversing the apartments subsided  and gradually the place became restored to its original silence  the mob  after having searched every other part of the house  and not finding the object of their search they concluded that he was not there  but must have made his escape before                                    this most desperate peril of sir francis varney seemed to have more effect upon him than anything that had occurred during his most strange and most eventful career when he was assured that the riotous mob that had been so intent upon his destruction was gone  and that he might emerge from his place of concealment  he did so with an appearance of such utter exhaustion that the bannerworth family could not but look upon him as a being who was near his end at any time his countenance  as we long have had occasion to remark  was a strange and unearthly looking one  but when we come to superadd to the strangeness of his ordinary appearance the traces of deep mental emotion  we may well say that varney s appearance was positively of the most alarming character when he was seated in the ordinary sitting apartment of the bannerworths  he drew a long sighing breath  and placing his hand upon his heart  he said  in a faint tone of voice it beats now laboriously  but it will soon cease its pulsations for ever these words sounded absolutely prophetic  there was about them such a solemn aspect  and he looked at the same time that he uttered them so much like one whose mortal race was run  and who was now a candidate for the grave do not speak so despairingly  said charles holland  remember  that if your life has been one of errors hitherto  how short a space of time may suffice to redeem some of them at least  and the communication to me which you have not yet completed may to some extent have such an effect no  no  it may contribute to an act of justice  but it can do no good to me  and yet do not suppose that because such is my impression that i mean to hesitate in finishing to you that communication i rejoice to hear you say so  and if you would  now that you must be aware of what good feelings towards you we are all animated with  remove the bar of secrecy from the communication  i should esteem it a great favour varney appeared to be considering for a few moments  and then he said well  well  let the secrecy no longer exist  have it removed at once  i will no longer seek to maintain it  tell all  charles holland tell all thus empowered by the mysterious being  charles holland related briefly what varney had already told him  and then concluded by saying that is all that i have myself as yet been made aware of  and i now call upon sir francis varney to finish his narration i am weak  said varney  and scarcely equal to the task  but yet i will not shrink from the promise that i have made  you have been the preservers of my life  and more particularly to you  flora bannerworth am i indebted for an existence  which otherwise must have been sacrificed upon the altar of superstition but you will recollect  master varney  said the admiral  who had sat looking on for some time in silent wonder  you must recollect  master varney  that the people are  after all  not so much to blame for their superstition  because  whether you are a vampyre or not  and i don t pretend to come to a positive opinion now  you took good care to persuade them you were i did  said varney  with a shudder  but why did i well  you know best it was  then  because i did believe  and do believe  that there is something more than natural about my strangely protracted existence  but we will waive that point  and  before my failing strength  for it appears to me to be failing  completely prevents me from doing so  let me relate to you the continued particulars of the circumstances that made me what i am flora bannerworth  although she had heard before from the lips of charles holland the to her dreadful fact  that her father  in addition to having laid violent hands upon his own life  was a murderer  now that that fearful circumstance was related more publicly  felt a greater pang than she had done when it was whispered to her in the accents of pure affection  and softened down by a gentleness of tone  which charles holland s natural delicacy would not allow him to use even to her whom he loved so well in the presence of others she let her beautiful face be hidden by her hands  and she wept as she listened to the sad detail varney looked inquiringly in the countenance of charles holland because  having given him leave to make flora acquainted with the circumstance  he was rather surprised at the amount of emotion which it produced in her charles holland answered the appealing look by saying flora is already aware of the facts  but it naturally affects her much to hear them now repeated in the presence of others  and those too towards whom she cannot feel what charles holland was going to say was abruptly stopped short by the admiral  who interposed  exclaiming why  what do you mean  you son of a sea cook  the presence of who do you mean  do you mean to say that i don t feel for miss flora  bless her heart  quite as much as a white faced looking swab like you  why  i shall begin to think you are only fit for a marine nay  uncle  now do not put yourself out of temper  you must be well aware that i could not mean anything disrespectful to you  you should not suppose such a state of things possible  and although  perhaps  i did not express myself so felicitously as i might  yet what i intended to say  was oh  bother what you intended to say  you go on  mr  vampyre  with your story  i want to know what became of it all  just you get on as quick as you can  and let us know what you did after the man was murdered when the dreadful deed was committed  said varney  and our victim lay weltering in his blood  and had breathed his last  we stood like men who for the first time were awakened to the frightful consequences of what they had done i saw by the dim light that hovered round us a great change come over the countenance of marmaduke bannerworth  and he shook in every limb this soon passed away  however  and the powerful and urgent necessity which arose of avoiding the consequences of the deed that we had done restored us to ourselves  we stooped and took from the body the ill gotten gains of the gambler  they amounted to an immense sum  and i said to marmaduke bannerworth take you the whole of this money and proceed to your own home with it where you will be least suspected  hide it in some place of great secrecy  and to morrow i will call upon you  when we will divide it  and will consider of some means of safely exchanging the notes for gold he agreed to this  and placed the money in his pocket  after which it became necessary that we should dispose of the body  which  if we did not quickly remove  must in a few hours be discovered  and so perchance  accompanied by other criminating circumstances  become a frightful evidence against us  and entail upon us all those consequences of the deed which we were so truly anxious to escape from it is ever the worst part of the murderer s task  that after he has struck the blow that has deprived his victim of existence  it becomes his frightful duty to secrete the corpse  which  with its dead eyes ever seems to be glaring upon him such a world of reproach that it is which should make people pause ere they dipped their hands in the blood of others  and that it is which becomes the first retribution that the murderer has to endure for the deep crime that he has committed we tore two stakes from a hedge  and with their assistance we contrived to dig a very superficial hole  such a hole as was only sufficient  by placing a thin coating of earth over it  to conceal the body of the murdered man and then came the loathsome task of dragging him into it a task full of horror  and from which we shrunk aghast  but it had to be done  and therefore  we stooped  and grasping the clothes as best we might  we dragged the body into the chasm we had prepared for its reception  glad were we then to be enabled to throw the earth upon it and to stamp upon it with such vehemence as might well be supposed to actuate men deeply anxious to put out of sight some dangerous and loathsome object when we had completed this  and likewise gathered handsfull of dust from the road  and dry leaves  and such other matter  to sprinkle upon the grave  so as to give the earth an appearance of not having been disturbed  we looked at each other and breathed from our toil then  and not till then  was it that we remembered that among other things which the gambler had won of marmaduke were the deeds belonging to the dearbrook property the dearbrook property  exclaimed henry bannerworth  i know that there was a small estate going by that name  which belonged to our family  but i always understood that long ago my father had parted with it yes  it was mortgaged for a small sum a sum not a fourth part of its value and it had been redeemed by marmaduke bannerworth  not for the purpose of keeping it  but in order that he might sell it outright  and so partially remedy his exhausted finances i was not aware of that  returned henry doubtless you were not  for of late i mean for the twelve months or so preceding your father s death you know he was much estranged from all the family  so that you none of you knew much of what he was doing except that he was carrying on a very wild and reckless career  such as was sure to end in dishonour and poverty  but i tell you he had the title deeds of the dearbrook property  and that they were only got from him  along with everything else of value that he possessed  at the gaming table  by the man who paid such a fearful penalty for his success it was not until after the body was completely buried  and we had completed all our precautions for more effectually hiding it from observation  that we recollected the fact of those important papers being in his possession  it was marmaduke bannerworth who first remembered it  and he exclaimed by heaven  we have buried the title deeds of the property  and we shall have again to exhume the corpse for the purpose of procuring them now those deeds were nothing to me  and repugnant as i had felt from the first to having anything whatever to do with the dead body  it was not likely that i would again drag it from the earth for such an object marmaduke bannerworth  i said  you can do what you please  and take the consequences of what you do  but i will not again  if i can help it look upon the face of that corpse  it is too fearful a sight to contemplate again  you have a large sum of money  and what need you care now for the title deeds of a property comparatively insignificant well  well  he said  i will not  at the present time  disturb the remains  i will wait to see if anything should arise from the fact of the murder  if it should turn out that no suspicion of any kind is excited  but that all is still and quiet  i can then take measures to exhume the corpse  and recover those papers  which certainly are important by this time the morning was creeping on apace  and we thought it prudent to leave the spot  we stood at the end of the lane for a few moments conversing  and those moments were the last in which i ever saw marmaduke bannerworth answer me a question  said henry i will  ask me what you please  i will answer it was it you that called at bannerworth hall  after my father s melancholy death  and inquired for him i did  and when i heard of the deed that he had done  i at once left in order to hold counsel with myself as to what i should do to obtain at least a portion of the property  one half of which  it was understood was to have been mine  i heard what had been the last words used by marmaduke bannerworth on the occasion of his death  and they were amply sufficient to let me know what had been done with the money at all events  so far as regards the bestowal of it in some secret place  and from that moment the idea of  by some means or another  getting the exclusive possession of it  never forsook my mind i thought over the matter by day and  by night  and with the exception of having a knowledge of the actual hiding place of the money  i could see  in the clearest possible manner  how the whole affair had been transacted  there can be no doubt but that marmaduke bannerworth had reached home safely with the large sum of which he had become possessed and that he had hidden it securely  which was but an ordinary measure of precaution  when we come to consider how the property had been obtained then i suspect that  being alone  and left to the gloom of his own miserable thoughts  they reverted so painfully to the past that he was compelled to drink deeply for the purpose of drowning reflection the natural consequence of this  in his state  was  that partial insanity supervened  and at a moment when frenzy rose far above reflection  he must have committed the dreadful act which hurried him instantaneously to eternity yes  said henry  it must have been so  you have guessed truly  he did on that occasion drink an immense quantity of wine  but instead of stilling the pangs of remorse it must have increased them  and placed him in such a frenzied condition of intellect  that he found it impossible to withstand the impulse of it  unless by the terrific act which ended his existence yes  and which at once crushed all my expectations of the large fortune which was to have been mine  for even the one half of the sum which had been taken from the gamester s pocket would have been sufficient to have enabled me to live for the future in affluence i became perfectly maddened at the idea that so large a sum had passed out of my hands  i constantly hovered about bannerworth hall  hoping and expecting that something might arise which would enable me to get admittance to it  and make an active search through its recesses for the hidden treasure all my exertions were in vain  i could hit upon no scheme whatever  and at length  wearied and exhausted  i was compelled to proceed to london for the sake of a subsistence  it is only in that great metropolis that such persons as myself  destitute of real resources  but infinitely reckless as regards the means by which they acquire a subsistence  can hope to do so  once again  therefore  i plunged into the vortex of london life  and proceeded  heedless of the criminality of what i was about  to cater for myself by robbery  or  indeed  in any manner which presented a prospect of success  it was during this career of mine  that i became associated with some of the most desperate characters of the time  and the offences we committed were of that daring character that it could not be wondered at eventually so formidable a gang of desperadoes must be by force broken up it so occurred  but unknown to us  that the police resolved upon making one of the most vigorous efforts to put an end to the affair  and in consequence a watch was set upon every one of our movements the result of this was  as might have been expected  our complete dispersion  and the arrest of some our members  and among them myself i knew my fate almost from the first  our depredations had created such a sensation  that the legislature  even  had made it a matter of importance that we should be suppressed  and it was an understood thing among the judges  that the severest penalties of the law should be inflicted upon any one of the gang who might be apprehended and convicted my trial scarcely occupied an hour  and then i was convicted and sentenced to execution  with an intimation from the judge that it would be perfectly absurd of me to dream  for one moment  of a remission of that sentence in this state of affairs  and seeing nothing but death before me  i gave myself up to despair  and narrowly missed cheating the hangman of his victim more dead than alive  i was  however  dragged out to be judicially murdered  and i shall never forget the crowd of frightful sensations that came across my mind upon that terrific occasion it seemed as if my fate had then reached its climax  and i have really but a dim recollection of the terrible scene i remember something of the confused murmur arising from an immense throng of persons  i remember looking about me  and seeing nothing but what appeared to me an immense sea of human heads  and then suddenly i heard a loud roar of execration burst from the multitude i shrunk back terrified  and it did  indeed  seem to me a brutal thing thus to roar and shout at a man who was brought out to die  i soon however  found that the mob who came to see such a spectacle was not so debased as i imagined  but that it was at the hangman  who had suddenly made his appearance on the scaffold  at whom they raised that fearful yell some one i think it was one of the sheriffs must have noticed that i was labouring under the impression that the cry from the mob was levelled at me  for he spoke  saying it is at the hangman they shout  and he indicated with his finger that public functionary  in my mind s eye i think i see him now  and i am certain that i shall never forget the expression of his face  it was perfectly fearful  and afterwards  when i learned who and what he was  i was not surprised that he should feel so acutely the painfully degrading office which he had to perform the fatal rope was in a few minutes adjusted to my neck  i felt its pressure  and i heard the confused sounds of the monotonous voice of the clergyman  as he muttered some prayers  that i must confess sounded to me at the time like a mockery of human suffering then suddenly there was a loud shout i felt the platform give way beneath my feet i tried to utter a yell of agony  but could not it seemed to me as if i was encompassed by fire  and then sensation left me  and i knew no more                                    the next feelings of existence that came over me consisted in a frightful tingling sensation throughout my veins  and i felt myself making vain efforts to scream  all the sensations of a person suffering from a severe attack of nightmare came across me  and i was in such an agony  that i inwardly prayed for death to release me from such a cruel state of suffering  then suddenly the power to utter a sound came to me and i made use of it well  for the piercing shriek i uttered  must have struck terror into the hearts of all who heard it  since it appalled even myself then i suppose i must have fainted  but when i recovered consciousness again  i found myself upon a couch  and a man presenting some stimulus to me in a cup  i could not distinguish objects distinctly  but i heard him say  drink  and you will be better i did drink  for a raging thirst consumed me  and then i fell into a sound sleep  which  i was afterwards told  lasted nearly twenty four hours  and when i recovered from that  i heard again the same voice that had before spoken to me  asking me how i was i turned in the direction of the sound  and  as my vision was now clearer  i could see that it was the hangman  whose face had made upon the scaffold such an impression upon me an impression which i then considered my last in this world  but which turned out not to be such by many a mingled one of pain and pleasure since it was some time before i could speak  and when i did  it was only in a few muttered words  to ask what had happened  and where i was do you not remember  he said  that you were hanged i do i do  was my reply  is this the region of damned souls no  you are still in this world  however strange you may think it listen to me  and i will briefly tell you how it is that you have come back again  as it were  from the very grave  to live and walk about among the living i listened to him with a strange and rapt attention  and then he told how a young and enthusiastic medical man had been anxious to try some experiments with regard to the restoration of persons apparently dead and he proceeded to relate how it was that he had given ear to the solicitations of the man  and had consented to bring my body after it was hung for him to experiment upon  he related how the doctor had been successful  but how he was so terrified at his own success  that he hastily fled  and had left london  no one knowing whither he had gone i listened to this with the most profound attention  and then he concluded  by saying to me there can be no doubt but my duty requires of me to give you up again to the offended laws of your country  i will not  however  do that  if you will consent to an arrangement that i shall propose to you i asked him what the arrangement was  and he said that if i would solemnly bind myself to pay to him a certain sum per annum  he would keep my secret  and forsaking his calling as hangman  endeavour to do something that should bring with it pleasanter results  i did so solemnly promise him  and i have kept my word  by one means or another i have succeeded in procuring the required amount  and now he is no more i believe  cried henry  that he has fallen a victim to the blind fury of the populace you are right  he has so  and accordingly i am relieved from the burden of those payments  but it matters little  for now i am so near the tomb myself  that  together with all my obligations  i shall soon be beyond the reach of mortal cavilling you need not think so  varney  you must remember that you are at present suffering from circumstances  the pressure of which will soon pass away  and then you will resume your wonted habits what did you do next  said the admiral let s know all while you are about it i remained at the hangman s house for some time  until all fear of discovery was over  and then he removed me to a place of greater security  providing me from his own resources with the means of existence  until i had fully recovered my health  and then he told me to shift for myself during my confinement though  i had not been idle mentally  for i concocted a plan  by which i should be enabled not only to live well myself  but to pay to the hangman  whose name was mortimore  the annual sum i had agreed upon  i need not go into the details of this plan  of course it was neither an honest nor respectable one  but it succeeded and i soon found myself in a position to enable me thereby to keep my engagement  as well as to supply me with means of plotting and planning for my future fortunes i had never for a moment forgotten that so large a sum of money was somewhere concealed about bannerworth hall  and i still looked forward to obtaining it by some means or another it was in this juncture of affairs  that one night i was riding on horseback through a desolate part of england  the moon was shining sweetly  as i came to a broad stream of water  across which  about a mile further on  i saw that there was a bridge  but being unwilling to waste time by riding up to it  and fancying  by the lazy ripple of the waters  that the river was not shallow  i plunged my horse boldly into the stream when we reached its centre  some sudden indisposition must have seized the horse  for instead of swimming on well and gallantly as it had done before  it paused for a moment  and then plunged headlong into the torrent i could not swim  and so  for a second time  death  with all its terrors  appeared to be taking possession of me  the waters rolled over my head  gurgling and hissing in my ears  and then all was past  i know no more  until i found myself lying upon a bright green meadow  and the full beams of the moon shining upon me i was giddy and sick  but i rose  and walked slowly away  each moment gathering fresh strength  and from that time to this  i never discovered how i came to be rescued from the water  and lying upon that green bank it has ever been a mystery to me  and i expect it ever will then from that moment the idea that i had a sort of charmed life came across me  and i walked about with an impression that such was the case until i came across a man who said that he was a hungarian  and who was full of strange stories of vampyres  among other things  he told me that a vampyre could not be drowned  for that the waters would cast him upon its banks  and  if the moonbeams fell upon him  he would be restored to life this was precisely my story  and from that moment i believed myself to be one of those horrible  but charmed beings  doomed to such a protracted existence  the notion grew upon me day by day  and hour by hour  until it became quite a fixed and strong belief  and i was deceiving no one when i played the horrible part that has been attributed to me but you don t mean to say that you believe you are a vampyre now  said the admiral i say nothing  and know not what to think  i am a desperate man  and what there is at all human in me  strange to say  all of you whom i sought to injure  have awakened heed not that  said henry  but continue your narrative  we have forgiven everything  and that ought to suffice to quiet your mind upon such a subject i will continue  and  believe me  i will conceal nothing from you  i look upon the words i am now uttering as a full  candid  and free confession  and  therefore  it shall be complete the idea struck me that if  by taking advantage of my supposed preternatural gifts  i could drive you from bannerworth hall  i should have it to myself to hunt through at my leisure  and possibly find the treasure  i had heard from marmaduke bannerworth some slight allusion to concealing the money behind a picture that was in a bed room called the panelled chamber  by inquiry  i ascertained that in that bed room slept flora bannerworth i had resolved  however  at first to try pacific measures  and accordingly  as you are well aware  i made various proposals to you to purchase or to rent bannerworth hall  the whole of which you rejected so that i found myself compelled to adopt the original means that had suggested themselves to me  and endeavour to terrify you from the house by prowling about  i made myself familiar with the grounds  and with all the plan of the residence  and then one night made my appearance in flora s chamber by the window but how do you account  said charles holland  for your extraordinary likeness to the portrait it is partly natural  for i belong to a collateral branch of the family  and it was previously arranged  i had seen the portrait in marmaduke bannerworth s time  and i knew some of its peculiarities and dress sufficiently well to imitate them  i calculated upon producing a much greater effect by such an imitation  and it appears that i was not wrong  for i did produce it to the full you did  indeed  said henry  and if you did not bring conviction to our minds that you were what you represented yourself to be  you at least staggered our judgments upon the occasion  and left us in a position of great doubt and difficulty i did  i did all that  i know i did  and  by pursuing that line of conduct  i  at last  i presume  entirely forced you from the house that you did flora fainted when i entered her chamber  and the moment i looked upon her sweet countenance my heart smote me for what i was about  but i solemnly aver  that my lips never touched her  and that  beyond the fright  she suffered nothing from varney  the vampyre and have you succeeded  said henry  in your object now no  the treasure has yet to be found  mortimore  the hangman  followed me into the house  guessing my intention  and indulging a hope that he would succeed in sharing with me its proceeds  but he  as well as myself  was foiled  and nothing came of the toilsome and anxious search but disappointment and bitterness then it is supposed that the money is still concealed i hope so  i hope  as well  that it will be discovered by you and yours  for surely none can have a better right to it than you  who have suffered so much on its account and yet  remarked henry  i cannot help thinking it is too securely hidden from us  the picture has been repeatedly removed from its place and produced no results  so that i fear we have little to expect from any further or more protracted research i think  said varney  that you have everything to expect  the words of the dying marmaduke bannerworth  you may depend  were not spoken in vain  and i have every reason to believe that  sooner or later  you must  without question  become the possessors of that sum but ought we rightly to hold it who ought more rightly to hold it  said varney  answer me that that s a sensible enough idea of your s  said the admiral  and if you were twice over a vampyre  i would tell you so  it s a very sensible idea  i should like to know who has more right to it than those who have had such a world of trouble about it well  well  said henry  we must not dispute  as yet  about a sum of money that may really never come to hand  for my own part  i have little to hope for in the matter  but  certainly  nothing shall be spared  on my part  to effect such a thorough search of the hall as shall certainly bring it to light  if it be in existence i presume  sir francis varney  said charles holland  that you have now completed your narrative i have  after events are well known to you  and  now  i have but to lie down and die  with the hope of finding that rest and consolation in the tomb which has been denied me hitherto in this world  my life has been a stormy one  and full of the results of angry passions  i do hope now that  for the short time i have to live  i shall know something like serenity  and die in peace you may depend  varney  that  as long as you have an asylum with us said the admiral and that you may have as long as you like you may be at peace  i consider that you have surrendered at discretion  and under such circumstances  an enemy always deserves honourable treatment and always gets it on board such a ship as this there you go again  said jack  calling the house a ship what s that to you  if i were to call it a bowsprit  ain t i your captain  you lubber  and so  sure to be right  while you are wrong  in the natural order of things  but you go and lay down  master varney  and rest yourself  for you seem completely done up varney did look fearfully exhausted  and  with the assistance of henry and charles  he went into another apartment  and laid down upon a couch showing great symptoms of debility and want of power and now it was a calm  varney s stay at the cottage of the bannerworths was productive of a different mood of mind than ever he had possessed before  he looked upon them in a very different manner to what he had been used to  he had  moreover  considerably altered prospects  there could not be the same hopes and expectations that he once had  he was an altered man  he saw in the bannerworths those who had saved his life and who  without doubt  had possessed an opinion  not merely obnoxious to him  but must have had some fearful misgivings concerning his character  and that  too  of a nature that usually shuts out all hope of being received into any family but  in the hour of his need  when his life was in danger  no one else would have done what they had done for him  especially when so relatively placed moreover  he had been concealed  when to do so was both dangerous and difficult  and then it was done by flora bannerworth herself time flew by  the mode of passing time at the cottage was calm and serene  varney had seldom witnessed anything like it  but  at the same time  he felt more at ease than ever he had  he was charmed with the society of flora in fact  with the whole of the little knot of individuals who there collected together  from what he saw he was gratified in their society  and it seemed to alleviate his mental disquiet  and the sense he must feel of his own peculiar position  but varney became ill  the state of mind and body he had been in for some time past might be the cause of it  he had been much harassed  and hunted from place to place  there was not a moment in which his life was not in danger  and he had  moreover  more than one case  received some bodily injuries  bruises  and contusions of a desperate character  and yet he would take no notice of them  but allow them to get well again as best they could illustration his escapes and injuries had made a deep impression upon his mind  and had no doubt a corresponding effect upon his body  and varney became very ill flora bannerworth did all that could be done for one in his painful position  and this greatly added to the depths of thought that occasionally beset him  and he could scarcely draw one limb after the other he walked from room to room in the twilight  at which time he had more liberty permitted him than at any other  because there was not the same danger in his doing so  for  if once seen  there could be no manner of doubt but he would have been pursued until he was destroyed  when no other means of escape were at hand  and varney himself felt that there could be no chance of his again escaping from them  for his physical powers were fast decaying  he was not  in fact  the same man he came out into the parlour from the room in which he had been seated during the day  flora and her mother were there  while charles holland and henry bannerworth had both at that moment entered the apartment good evening  miss bannerworth  said sir francis  bowing to her  and then to her mother  mrs  bannerworth  and you  mr  holland  i see  have been out enjoying the free breeze that plays over the hot fields  it must be refreshing it is so  sir  said charles  i wish we could make you a partaker in our walks i wish you could with all my heart  said varney sir francis  said flora  must be a prisoner for some short time longer yet i ought not to consider it in any such light  it is not imprisonment  i have taken sanctuary  it is the well spring of life to me  said varney i hope it may prove so  but how do you find yourself this evening  sir francis varney really  it is difficult to say i fluctuate  at times  i feel as though i should drop insensible on the earth  and then i feel better than i have done for some time previously doctor chillingworth will be here bye and bye  no doubt  and he must see what he can do for you to relieve you of these symptoms  said flora i am much beholden to you much beholden to you  but i hope to be able to do without the good doctor s aid in this instance  though i must admit i may appear ungrateful not at all not at all have you heard any news abroad to day  inquired varney none  sir francis none  there is nothing apparently stirring  and now go out when you would  you would find nothing but what was old  quiet and familiar we cannot wish to look upon anything with mere charms for a mind at ease  than we can see under such circumstances  but i fear there are some few old and familiar features that i should find sad havoc in you would  certainly  for the burnings and razings to the ground of some places  have made some dismal appearances  but time may efface that  and then the evil may die away  and the future will become the present  should we be able to allay popular feeling yes  said sir francis  but popular prejudices  or justice  or feeling  are things not easily assuaged  the people when once aroused go on to commit all kinds of excess  and there is no one point at which they will step short of the complete extirpation of some one object or other that they have taken a fancy to hunt the hubbub and excitement must subside the greater the ignorance the more persevering and the more brutal they are  said sir francis  but i must not complain of what is the necessary consequence of their state it might be otherwise so it might  and no mischief arise either  but as we cannot divert the stream  we may as well bend to the force of a current too strong to resist the moon is up  said flora  who wished to turn the conversation from that to another topic  i see it yonder through the trees  it rises red and large it is very beautiful and yet there is not a cloud about to give it the colour and appearance it now wears exactly so  said sir francis varney  but the reason is the air is filled with a light  invisible vapour  that has the effect you perceive there has been much evaporation going on  and now it shows itself in giving the moon that peculiar large appearance and deep colour ay  i see  it peeps through the trees  the branches of which cut it up into various portions  it is singular  and yet beautiful  and yet the earth below seems dark it is dark  you would be surprised to find it so if you walked about it will soon be lighter than it is at this present moment what sounds are those  inquired sir francis varney  as he listened attentively sounds  what sounds  returned henry the sounds of wheels and horses  feet  said varney i cannot even hear them  much less can i tell what they are  said henry then listen  now they come along the road  cannot you hear them now said varney yes  i can  said charles holland  but i really don t know what they are  or what it can matter to us  we don t expect any visitors certainly  certainly  said varney  i am somewhat apprehensive of the approach of strange sounds you are not likely to be disturbed here  said charles indeed  i thought so when i had succeeded in getting into the house near the town  and so far from believing it was likely i should be discovered  that i sat on the house top while the mob surrounded it did you not hear them coming i did and yet you did not attempt to escape from them no  i could not persuade them i was not there save by my utter silence i allowed them to come too close to leave myself time to escape besides  i could hardly persuade myself there could be any necessity for so doing it was fortunate it was as it happened afterwards  that you were able to reach the wood  and get out of it unperceived by the mob i should have been in an unfortunate condition had i been in their hands long  a man made of iron would not be able to resist the brutality of those people as they were speaking  a gig  with two men  drove up  followed by one on horseback  they stopped at the garden gate  and then tarried to consult with each other  as they looked at the house what can they want  i wonder  inquired henry  i never saw them before nor i  said charles holland do you not know them at all  inquired varney no  replied flora  i never saw them  neither can i imagine what is their object in coming here did you ever see them before  inquired henry of his mother  who held up her hand to look more carefully at the strangers  then  shaking her head  she declared she had never seen such persons as those i dare say not  said charles holland  they certainly are not gentlemen  but here they come  there is some mistake  i daresay they don t want to come here as they spoke  the two strangers got down  after picking up a topcoat they had let fall  they turned round  and deliberately put it into the chaise again  they walked up the path to the door  at which they knocked the door was opened by the old woman  when the two men entered does francis beauchamp live here eh  said the old woman  who was a little deaf  and she put her hand behind her ear to catch the sounds more distinctly eh who did you say sir francis varney started as the sounds came upon his ear  but he sat still an attentive listener are there any strangers in the house  inquired the other officer impatiently  who is here strangers  said the old woman  you are the only strangers that i have seen here come  said the officer to his companion  come this way  there are people in this parlour  our business must be an apology for any rudeness we may commit as he spoke he stepped by the old woman  and laying his hand upon the handle of the door  entered the apartment  at the same time looking carefully around the room as if he expected some one ladies  said the stranger  with an off hand politeness that had something repulsive in it  though it was meant to convey a notion that civility was intended  ladies  i beg pardon for intruding  but i am looking for a gentleman you shall hear from me again soon  said sir francis  in an almost imperceptible whisper what is the object of this intrusion  demanded henry bannerworth rising and confronting the stranger  this is a strange introduction yes  but not an unusual one  said the stranger  in these cases being unavoidable  at the least sir  said charles holland  if you cannot explain quickly your business here  we will proceed to take those measures which will at least rid ourselves of your company softly  sir  i mean no offence not the least  but i tell you i do not come for any purpose that is at all consonant to my wishes  i am a bow street officer in the execution of my duty excuse me  therefore whom do you want francis beauchamp  and  from the peculiarity of the appearance of this individual here  i think i may safely request the pleasure of his company varney now rose  and the officer made a rush at him  when he saw him do so  saying surrender in the king s name varney  however  paid no attention to that  but rushed past  throwing his chair down to impede the officer  who could not stay himself  but fell over it  while varney made a rush towards the window  which he cleared at one bound  and crossing the road  was lost to sight in a few seconds  in the trees and hedges on the other side accidents will happen  said the officer  as he rose to his feet  i did not think the fellow would have taken the window in that manner  but we have him in view  and that will be enough in heaven s name  said henry  explain all about this  we cannot understand one word of it i am at a loss to understand one word of it we will return and do so presently  said the officer as he dashed out of the house after the fugitive at a rapid and reckless speed  followed by his companion the man who had been left with the chaise  however  was the first in the chase  seeing an escape from the window  he immediately guessed that he was the man wanted  and  but for an accident  he would have met varney at the gate  for  as he was getting out in a hurry  his foot became entangled with the reins  and he fell to the ground  and varney at the same moment stepped over him curse his infernal impudence  and d n these reins  muttered the man in a fury at the accident  and the aggravating circumstance of the fugitive walking over him in such a manner  and so coolly too it was vexing the man  however  quickly released himself  and rushed after varney across the road  and kept on his track for some time  the moon was still rising  and shed but a gloomy light around  everything was almost invisible until you came close to it  this was the reason why varney and his pursuer met with several severe accidents fumbles and hard knocks against impediments which the light and the rapid flight they were taking did not admit of their avoiding very well they went on for some time  but it was evident varney knew the place best  and could avoid what the man could not  and that was the trees and the natural impediments of the ground  which varney was acquainted with for instance  at full speed across a meadow  a hollow would suddenly present itself  and to an accustomed eye the moonlight might enable it to be distinguished at a glance what it was  while to one wholly unaccustomed to it  the hollow would often look like a hillock by such a light  this varney would clear at a bound  which a less agile and heavier person would step into  lifting up his leg to meet an impediment  when he would find it come down suddenly some six or eight inches lower than he anticipated  almost dislocating his leg and neck and producing a corresponding loss of breath  which was not regained by the muttered curse upon such a country where the places were so uneven having come to one of these places  which was a little more perceptible than the others  he made a desperate jump  but he jumped into the middle of the hole with such force that he sprained his ankle  besides sinking into a small pond that was almost dry  being overgrown with rushes and aquatic plants well  said the other officer coming up well well  indeed  said the one who came first  it s anything but well d n all country excursions say i why  bob  you don t mean to say as how you are caught in a rat trap oh  you be d d  i am  ain t i yes  but are you going to stop there  or coming out  eh  you ll catch cold i have sprained my ankle well it ain t well  i tell you  here have i a sprained foot  and my wind broken for a month at least  why were you not quicker  if you had been sharper we should have had the gentleman  i ll swear i tumbled down over the chair  and he got out of the window  and i come out of the door well  i got entangled in the reins  but i got off after him  only his long legs carried him over everything  i tell you what  wilkinson  if i were to be born again  and intended to be a runner  i would bespeak a pair of long legs why because i should be able to get along better  you have no idea of how he skimmed along the ground  it was quite beautiful  only it wasn t good to follow it a regular sky scraper yes  or something of that sort  he looked like a patent flying shadow well  get up and lead the way  we ll follow you i dare say you will when i lead the way back there  for as to going out yonder  it is quite out of the question  i want supper to night and breakfast to morrow morning well  what has that to do with it just this much  if you follow any farther  you ll get into the woods and there you ll be  going round and round  like a squirrel in a cage without being able to get out  and you will there get none of the good things included under the head of those meals i think so too  said the third well  then  let s go back  we needn t run  though it might be as well to do so it would be anything but well  i don t gallop back  depend upon it the three men now slowly returned from their useless chase  and re trod the way they had passed once in such a hurry that they could hardly recognize it what a dreadful bump i came against that pole standing there  said one yes  and i came against a hedge stake  that was placed so as the moon didn t show any light on it  it came into the pit of my stomach  i never recollect such a pain in my life  for all the world like a hot coal being suddenly and forcibly intruded into your stomach well  here s the road  i must go up to the house where i started him from  i promised them some explanation  i may as well go and give it to them at once do as you will  i will wait with the horse  else  perhaps  that beauchamp will again return and steal him the officer who had first entered the house now returned to the bannerworths  saying i promised you i would give you some explanation as to what you have witnessed yes  said henry  we have been awaiting your return with some anxiety and curiosity  what is the meaning of all this  i am  as we are all  in perfect ignorance of the meaning of what took place i will tell you  the person whom you have had here  and goes by the name of varney  is named francis beauchamp indeed  are you assured of this yes  perfectly assured of it  i have it in my warrant to apprehend him by either name what crime had he been guilty of i will tell you  he has been hanged hanged  exclaimed all present what do you mean by that  added henry  i am at a loss to understand what you can mean by saying he was hanged what i say is literally true pray tell us all about it  we are much interested in the fact  go on sir well  sir  then i believe it was for murder that francis beauchamp was hanged yes  hanged  a common execution  before a multitude of people collected to witness such an exhibition good god  exclaimed henry bannerworth  and was but that is impossible  a dead man come to life again  you must be amusing yourself at our expense not i  replied the officer  here is my warrant  they don t make these out in a joke and  as he spoke  he produced the warrant  when it was evident the officer spoke the truth how was this i will tell you  sir  you see that this varney was a regular scamp gamester  rogue  and murderer  he was hanged  and hung about the usual time  he was cut down and the body was given to some one for dissection when a surgeon  with the hangman  one montgomery  succeeded in restoring the criminal to life but i always thought they broke the neck when they were hanged  the weight of the body would alone do that oh  dear  no  sir  said the officer  that is one of the common every day mistakes  they don t break the neck once in twenty times indeed no  they die of suffocation only  this man  beauchamp  was hanged thus but they contrived to restore him  and then he assumed a new name  and left london but how came you to know all this oh  it came to us  as many things usually do  in a very extraordinary manner  and in a manner that appears most singular and out of the way but such it was the executioner who was the means of his being restored  or one of them  wished to turn him to account  and used to draw a yearly sum of money from him  as hush money  to induce them to keep the secret  else the fact of his having escaped punishment would subject him to a repetition of the same punishment  when  of course  a little more care would be taken that he did not escape a second time i dare say not well  you see  varney  or rather beauchamp  was to pay a heavy sum to this man to keep him quiet  and to permit him to enjoy the life he had so strangely become possessed of i see  said holland well  this man  montgomery  had always some kind of suspicion that varney would murder him murder him  and be the means of saving his life  surely he could not be so bad as that why  you see  sir  this hangman drew a heavy sum yearly from him  thus making him only a mine of wealth to himself  this  no doubt  would rankle in the other s heart  to think he should be so beset  and hold life upon such terms i see  now yes  and then came the consideration that he did not do it from any good motive  merely a selfish one  and he was consequently under no obligation to him for what he had done  besides  self preservation might urge him on  and tell him to do the deed however that may be  montgomery dreaded it  and was resolved to punish the deed if he could not prevent it  he  therefore  left general orders with his wife  whenever he went on a journey to varney  if he should be gone beyond a certain time  she was to open a certain drawer  and take out a sealed packet to the magistrate at the chief office  who would attend to it he has been missing  and his wife did as she was desired  and now we have found what he there mentioned to be true  but  now  sir  i have satisfied you and explained to you why we intruded upon you  we must now leave and seek for him elsewhere it is most extraordinary  and that is the reason why his complexion is so singular very likely they poured out some wine  which was handed to the officers  who drank and then quitted the house  leaving the inmates in a state of stupefaction  from surprise and amazement at what they had heard from the officers there was a strange feeling came over them when they recollected the many occurrences they had witnessed  and even the explanation of the officers  it seemed as if some mist had enveloped objects and rendered them indistinct  but which was fast rising  and they were becoming plainer and more distinct every moment in which they were regarded there was a long pause  and flora was about to speak  when suddenly there came the sound of a footstep across the garden  it was slow but unsteady  and paused between whiles until it came close beneath the windows  they remained silent  and then some one was heard to climb up the rails of the veranda  and then the curtains were thrust aside  but not till after the person outside had paused to ascertain who was there then the curtains were opened  and the visage of sir francis varney appeared  much altered  in fact  completely worn and exhausted it was useless to deny it  but he looked ghastly terrific  his singular visage was as pallid as death  his eyes almost protruding  his mouth opened  and his breathing short  and laboured in the extreme he climbed over with much difficulty  and staggered into the room  and would have spoken  but he could not  befell senseless upon the floor utterly exhausted and motionless there was a long pause  and each one present looked at each other  and then they gazed upon the inanimate body of sir francis varney  which lay supine and senseless in the middle of the floor    the importance of the document  said to be on the dead body  was such that it would admit of no delay before it was obtained  and the party determined that it should be commenced instanter  lost time would be an object to them  too much haste could hardly be made  and now came the question of  should it be to night  or not certainly  said henry bannerworth  the sooner we can get it  the sooner all doubt and distress will be at an end  and  considering the turn of events  that will be desirable for all our sakes  besides  we know not what unlucky accident may happen to deprive us of what is so necessary there can be none  said mr  chillingworth  but there is this to be said  this has been such an eventful history  that i cannot say what might or what might not happen we may as well go this very night  said charles holland  i give my vote for an immediate exhumation of the body  the night is somewhat stormy  but nothing more  the moon is up  and there will be plenty of light and rain  said the doctor little or none  said charles holland  a few gusts of wind now and then drive a few heavy plashes of rain against the windows  and that gives a fearful sound  which is  in fret  nothing  when you have to encounter it  but you will go  doctor yes  most certainly  we must have some tools those may be had from the garden  said henry  tools for the exhumation  you mean yes  pickaxe  mattocks  and a crowbar  a lantern  and so forth  said the doctor  you see i am at home in this  the fact is  i have had more than one affair of this kind on my hands before now  and whilst a student i have had more than one adventure of a strange character i dare say  doctor  said charles holland  you have some sad pranks to answer for  you don t think of it then  only when you find them accumulated in a heap  so that you shall not be able to escape them because they come over your senses when you sleep at night no  no  said chillingworth  you are mistaken in that  i have long since settled all my accounts of that nature  besides  i never took a dead body out of a grave but in the name of science  and never for my own profit  seeing i never sold one in my life  or got anything by it that is not the fact  said henry  you know  doctor  you improved your own talents and knowledge yes  yes  i did well  but you profited by such improvements well  granted  i did  how much more did the public not benefit then said the doctor  with a smile ah  well  we won t argue the question  said charles  only it strikes me that the doctor could never have been a doctor if he had not determined upon following a profession there may be a little truth in that  said chillingworth  but now we had better quit the house  and make the best of our way to the spot where the unfortunate man lies buried in his unhallowed grave come with me into the garden  said henry bannerworth  we shall there be able to suit ourselves to what is required  i have a couple of lanterns one is enough  said chillingworth  we had better not burden ourselves more than we are obliged to do  and we shall find enough to do with the tools yes  they are not light  and the distance is by far too great to make walking agreeable and easy  the wind blows strong  and the rain appears to be coming up afresh  and  by the time we have done  we shall find the ground will become slippy  and bad for walking can we have a conveyance no  no  said the doctor  we could  but we must trouble the turnpike man  besides  there is a shorter way across some fields  which will be better and safer well  well  said charles holland  i do not mind which way it is  as long as you are satisfied yourselves  the horse and cart would have settled it all better  and done it quicker  besides carrying the tools very true  very true  said the doctor  all that is not without its weight  and you shall choose which way you would have it done  for my part  i am persuaded the expedition on foot is to be preferred for two reasons and what are they the first is  we cannot obtain a horse and cart without giving some detail as to what you want it for  which is awkward  on account of the hour  moreover  you could not get one at this moment in time that ought to settle the argument  said henry bannerworth  an impossibility  under the circumstances  at once is a clincher  and one that may be allowed to have some weight you may say that  said charles besides which  you must go a greater distance  and that  too  along the main road  which is objectionable then we are agreed  said charles holland  and the sooner we are off the better  the night grows more and more gloomy every hour  and more inclement it will serve our purpose the better  said chillingworth  what we do we may as well do now come with me to the garden  said henry  and we will take the tools we can go out the back way  that will preclude any observation being made they all now left the apartment  wrapped up in great overcoats  to secure themselves against the weather  and also for the purpose of concealing themselves from any chance passenger in the garden they found the tools they required  and having chosen them  they took a lantern  with the mean of getting a light when they got to their journey s end  which they would do in less than an hour after having duly inspected the state of their efficiency  they started away on their expedition the night had turned gloomy and windy  heavy driving masses of clouds obscured the moon  which only now and then was to be seen  when the clouds permitted her to peep out  at the same time  there were many drifting showers  which lasted but a few minutes  and then the clouds were carried forwards by some sudden gust of wind so that  altogether it was a most uncomfortable night as well could be imagined however  there was no time to lose  and  under all circumstances  they could not have chosen a better night for their purpose than the one they had  indeed  they could not desire another night to be out on such a purpose they spoke not while they were within sight of the houses  though at the distance of many yards  and  at the same time  there was a noise through the trees that would have carried their voices past every object however close  but they would make assurance doubly sure i think we are fairly away now  said henry  from all fear of being recognized to be sure you are  who would recognize us now  if we were met no one i should think not  and  moreover  there would be but small chance of any evil coming from it  even if it were to happen that we were to be seen and known  nobody knows what we are going to do  and  if they did there is no illegality in the question certainly not  but we wish the matter to be quite secret  therefore  we don t wish to be seen by any one while upon this adventure exactly  said chillingworth  and  if you ll follow my guidance  you shall meet nobody we will trust you  most worthy doctor  what have you to say for our confidence that you will find it is not misplaced just as the doctor had uttered the last sound  there came a hearty laugh upon the air  which  indeed  sounded but a few paces in advance of them the wind blew towards them  and would  therefore  cause the sounds to come to them  but not to go away in the direction they were going the whole party came to a sudden stand still  there was something so strange in hearing a laugh at that moment  especially as chillingworth was  at that moment  boasting of his knowledge of the ground and the certainty of their meeting no one what is that  inquired henry some one laughing  i think  said chillingworth of that there can be little or no doubt  said charles holland  and as people do not usually laugh by themselves so heartily  it may be presumed there are  at least  two no doubt of it and  moreover  their purpose cannot be a very good one  at this hour of the night  and of such a night  too  i think we had better be cautious hush  follow me silently  said henry as he spoke  he moved cautiously from the spot where he stood  and  at the same time  he was followed by the whole party  until they came to the hedge which skirted a lane  in which were seated three men they had a sort of tent erected  and that was hung upon a part of the hedge which was to windward of them  so that it sheltered them from wind and rain henry and chillingworth both peeped over the bank  and saw them seated beneath this kind of canopy  they were shabby  gipsy looking men  who might be something else sheep stealers  or horse stealers  in fact anything  even to beggars i say  jack  said one  it s no bottle to night no  there s nobody about these parts to night  we are safe  and so are they exactly besides  you see  those who do happen to be out are not worth talking to no cash none  not enough to pay turnpike for a walking slick  at the most besides  it does us no good to take a few shillings from a poor wretch who has more in family than he has shillings in pocket ay  you are right  quite right  i don t like it myself  i don t besides that  there s fresh risk in every man you stop  and these poor fellows will fight hard for a few shillings  and there is no knowing what an unlucky blow may do for a man that is very true  has anything been done to night nothing  said one only three half crowns  said the other  that is the extent of the common purse to night and i  said the third  i have got a bottle of bad gin from the cat and cabbage stump how did you manage it why  this way  i went in  and had some beer  and you know i can give a long yarn when i want  but it wants only a little care to deceive these knowing countrymen  so i talked and talked  until they got quite chatty and then i put the gin in my pocket good well  then  the loaf and beef i took out of the safe as i came by  and i dare say they know they have lost it by this time yes  and so do we  i expect the gin will help to digest the beef  so we mustn t complain of the goods no  give us another glass  jim jim held the glass towards him  when the doctor  animated by the spirit of mischief  took a good sized pebble  and threw it into the glass smashing it  and spilling the contents in a moment there was a change of scene  the men were all terrified  and started to their feet  while a sudden gust of wind caused their light to go out  at the same time their tent cloth was thrown down by the wind and fell across their heads come along  said the doctor there was no need of saying so  for in a moment the three were as if animated by one spirit  and away they scudded across the fields  with the speed of a race horse in a few minutes they were better than half a mile away from the spot in absence of all authentic information  said the doctor  speaking as well as he could  and blowing prodigiously between each word  as though he were fetching breath all the way from his heels  i think we may conclude we are safe from them  we ought to thank our stars we came across them in the way we did but  doctor  what in the name of heaven induced you to make such a noise  to frighten them  in fact  and to tell them some one was about they were too much terrified to tell whether it was one  or fifty  by this time they are out of the county  they knew what they were talking about and perhaps we may meet them on the road where we are going  thinking it a rare lonely spot where they can hide  and no chance of their being found out illustration no  said the doctor  they will not go to such a place  it has by far too bad a name for even such men as those to go near  much less stop in i can hardly think that  said charles holland  for these fellows are too terrified for their personal safety  to think of the superstitious fears with which a place may be regarded  and these men  in such a place as the one you speak of  they will be at home well  well  rather than be done  we must fight for it  and when you come to consider we have one pick and two shovels  we shall be in full force well said  doctor  how far have we to go not more than a quarter of a mile they pursued their way through the fields  and under the hedge rows until they came to a gate  where they stopped awhile  and began to consult and to listen a few yards up here  on the left  said the doctor  i know the spot besides  there is a particular mark  now  then  are you all ready yes  all here  said the doctor  pointing out the marks by which the spot might be recognized  here is the spot  and i think we shall not be half a foot out of our reckoning then let us begin instanter  said henry  as he seized hold of the pickaxe  and began to loosen the earth by means of the sharp end that will do for the present  said chillingworth  now let me and charles take a turn with our shovels  and you will get on again presently  throw the earth up on the bank in one heap  so that we can put it on again without attracting any attention to the spot by its being left in clods and uneven exactly  said henry  else the body will be discovered they began to shovel away  and continued to do so  after it had been picked up  working alternately  until at length charles stuck his pick axe into something soft  and upon pulling it up  he found it was the body a dreadful odour now arose from the spot  and they were at no loss to tell where the body lay  the pick axe had stuck into the deceased s ribs and clothing  and thus lifted it out of its place here it is  said the doctor  but i needn t tell you that  the charnel house smell is enough to convince you of the fact of where it is i think so  just show a light upon the subject  doctor  and then we can see what we are about do you mind  doctor you have the management of the lantern  you know yes  yes  said chillingworth  i see you have it don t be in a hurry but do things deliberately and coolly whatever you do you will not be so liable to make mistakes  or to leave anything undone there will be nothing of any use to you here  doctor  in the way of dissection  for the flesh is one mass of decay  what a horrible sight to be sure it is  but hasten the search well  i must  though  to confess the truth  i d sooner handle anything than this it is not the most pleasant thing in the world  for there is no knowing what may be the result what creeping thing has made a home of it don t mention anything about it henry and charles holland now began to search the pockets of the clothes of the dead body  in one of which was something hard  that felt like a parcel what have you got there  said chillingworth  as he held his lantern up so that the light fell upon the ghastly object that they were handling i think it is the prize  said charles holland  but we have not got it out yet  though i dare say it won t be long first  if this wind will but hold good for about five minutes  and keep the stench down they now tore open the packet and pulled out the papers  which appeared to have been secreted upon his person be sure there are none on any other part of the body  said chillingworth  because what you do now  you had better do well  and leave nothing to after thought  because it is frequently impracticable the advice is good  said henry  who made a second search  but found nothing we had better re bury him  said the doctor  it had better be done cleanly  well  it is a sad hole for a last resting place  and yet i do not know that it matters it is all a matter of taste the fashion of the class  or the particular custom of the country there was but little to be said against such an argument  though the custom of the age had caused them to look upon it more as a matter of feeling than in such a philosophical sense as that in which the doctor had put it well  there he is now shovel the earth in  charles  said henry bannerworth  as he himself set the example  which was speedily and vigorously followed by charles holland  when they were not long before the earth was thrown in and covered up with care  and trodden down so that it should not appear to be moved this will do  i think  said henry yes  it is not quite the same  but i dare say no one will try to make any discoveries in this place  besides  if the rain continues to come down very heavy  why  it will wash much of it away  and it will make it look all alike there was little inducement to hover about the spot  but henry could not forbear holding up the papers to the light of the lantern to ascertain what they were are they all right  inquired the doctor yes  replied henry  yes  the dearbrook estate  oh  yes  they are the papers i am in want of it is singularly fortunate  at least  to be successful in securing them  i am very glad a living person has possession of them  else it would have been very difficult to have obtained it from them so it would  but now homeward is the word  doctor  and on my word there is reason to be glad  for the rain is coming on very fast now  and there is no moon at all we had better step out they did  for the three walked as fast as the nature of the soil would permit them  and the darkness of the night chapter lxxxix tells what became of the second vampyre who sought varney illustration we left the hungarian nobleman swimming down the stream  he swam slowly and used but little exertion in doing so  he appeared to use his hands only as a means of assistance the stream carried him onwards  and he aided himself so far that he kept the middle of the stream  and floated along where the stream was broad and shallow  it sometimes left him a moment or two  without being strong enough to carry him onwards  then he would pause  as if gaining strength  and finally he would  when he had rested and the water came a little faster  and lifted him  make a desperate plunge  and swim forward  until he again came in deep water  and then he went slowly along with the stream  as he supported himself it was strange thus to see a man going down slowly  and without any effort whatever  passing through shade and through moonlight now lost in the shadow of the tall trees  and now emerging into that part of the stream which ran through meadows and cornfields  until the stream widened  and then  at length  a ferry house was to be seen in the distance then came the ferryman out of his hut  to look upon the beautiful moonlight scene  it was cold  but pure  and brilliantly light  the chaste moon was sailing through the heavens  and the stars diminished in their lustre by the power of the luminous goddess of night there was a small cottage true  it was somewhat larger than was generally supposed by any casual observer who might look at it  the place was rambling  and built chiefly of wood  but in it lived the ferryman  his wife  and family  among these was a young girl about seventeen years of age  but  at the same time  very beautiful they had been preparing their supper  and the ferryman himself walked out to look at the river and the shadows of the tall trees that stood on the hill opposite while thus employed  he heard a plashing in the water  and on turning towards the quarter whence the sound proceeded for a few yards  he came to the spot where he saw the stranger struggling in the stream good god  he muttered to himself  as he saw the struggle continued good god  he will sink and drown as he spoke  he jumped into his boat and pushed it off  for the purpose of stopping the descent of the body down the stream  and in a moment or two it came near to him  he muttered come  come he tries to swim  life is not gone yet he will do now  if i can catch hold of him  swimming with one s face under the stream doesn t say much for his skill  though it may account for the fact that he don t cry out as the drowning man neared  the ferryman held on by the boat hook  and stooping down  he seized the drowning man by the hair of the head  and then paused after a time  he lifted him up  and placed him across the edge of the boat  and then  with some struggling of his own  he was rolled over into the boat you are safe now  muttered the ferryman the stranger spoke not  but sat or leaned against the boat s head sobbing and catching at his breath  and spitting off his stomach the water it might be presumed he had swallowed the ferryman put back to the shore  when he paused  and secured his boat  and then pulled the stranger out  saying do you feel any better now yes  said the stranger  i feel i am living thanks to you  my good friend  i owe you my life you are welcome to that  replied the ferryman  it costs me nothing and  as for my little trouble  i should be sorry to think of that  when a fellow being s life was in danger you have behaved very well very well  and i can do little more now than thank you  for i have been robbed of all i possessed about me at the moment oh  you have been robbed aye  truly  i have  and have been thrown into the water  and thus i have been nearly murdered it is lucky you escaped from them without further injury  said the ferryman  but come in doors  you must be mad to stand here in the cold thank you  your hospitality is great  and  at this moment  of the greatest importance to me such as we have  said the honest ferryman  you shall be welcome to come in come in he turned round and led the way to the house  which he entered saying as he opened the small door that led into the main apartment where all the family were assembled  waiting for the almost only meal they had had that day  for the ferryman had not the means  before the sun had set  of sending for food  and then it was a long way before it could be found  and then it was late before they could get it wife  we have a stranger to sleep with us to night  and for whom we must prepare a bed a stranger  echoed the wife a stranger  and we so poor yes  one whose life i have saved  and who was nearly drowned  we cannot refuse hospitality upon such an occasion as that  you know  wife the wife looked at the stranger as he entered the room  and sat down by the fire i am sorry  he said  to intrude upon you  but i will make you amends for the interruption and inconvenience i may cause you  but it is too late to apply elsewhere  and yet i am doubtful  if there were  whether i could go any further no  no  said the ferryman  i am sure a man who has been beaten and robbed  and thrown into a rapid and  in some parts  deep stream  is not fit to travel at this time of night you are lonely about here  said the stranger  as he shivered by the fire yes  rather  but we are used to it you have a family  too  that must help to lighten the hours away  and help you over the long evenings so you may think  stranger  and  at times  so it is  but when food runs short  it is a long while to daylight  before any more money can be had to be sure  we have fish in the river  and we have what we can grow in the garden  but these are not all the wants that we feel  and those others are sometimes pinching  however  we are thankful for what we have  and complain but little when we can get no more  but sometimes we do repine though i cannot say we ought but i am merely relating the fact  whether it be right or wrong exactly  how old is your daughter she is seventeen come allhallow s eve that is not far hence  said the stranger  i hope i may be in this part of the country and i think i shall i will on that eve pay you a visit  not one on which i shall be a burden to you  but one more useful to you  and more consonant to my character the future will tell us all about that  said the ferryman  at present we will see what we can do  without complaining  or taxing anybody the stranger and the ferryman sat conversing for some time before the fire  and then the latter pointed out to him which was his bed one made up near the fire  for the sake of its warmth  and then the ferryman retired to the next room  a place which was merely divided by an imperfect partition however  they all fell soundly asleep  the hours on that day had been longer than usual  there was not that buoyancy of spirit  when they retired  they fell off into a heavy  deep slumber from this they were suddenly aroused by loud cries and piercing screams from one of the family so loud and shrill were the cries  that they all started up  terrified and bewildered beyond measure  unable to apply their faculties to any one object help help  father help  shrieked the voice of the young girl whom we have before noticed the ferryman jumped up  and rushed to the spot where his daughter lay fanny  he said fanny  what ails thee what ails thee  tell me  my dear child oh  she exclaimed  almost choked oh  father  are we all alone  i am terrified what ails thee what ails thee  tell me what caused you to scream out in such a manner i i that is i  father  thought but no  i am sure it was reality where is the stranger a light a light  shouted the fisherman in another moment a light was brought him  and he discovered the stranger reclining in his bed  but awake  and looking around him  as if in the utmost amazement what has happened  he said what has happened that is more than i know as yet  the man replied  come  fanny  he added  tell me what it is you fear  what caused you to scream out in that dreadful manner oh  father the vampyre great god  what do you mean  fanny  by that i hardly know  father  i was fast asleep  when i thought i felt something at my throat  but being very sound asleep  i did not immediately awake  presently i felt the sharp pang of teeth being driven into the flesh of my neck i awoke  and found the vampyre at his repast oh  god  oh  god  what shall i do stay  my child  let us examine the wound  said the fisherman  and he held the candle to the spot where the vampyre s teeth had been applied there  sure enough  were teeth marks  such as a human being s would make were they applied  but no blood had been drawn therefrom come  come  fanny  so far  by divine providence  you are not injured another moment  and the mischief would have been done entire and complete  and you would have been his victim then turning to the stranger  he said you have had some hand in this  no human being but you could come into this place  the cottage door is secured  you must be the vampyre i yes  who else could i as heaven s my judge but there  it s useless to speak of it  i have not been out of my bed  in this place  dark as it is  and less used to darkness than you  i could not even find my way about it is impossible get out of your bed  and let me feel  said the ferryman peremptorily get out  and i will soon tell the stranger arose  and began to dress himself  and the ferryman immediately felt the bed on which he had been lying  but it was ice cold so cold that he started upon his legs in an instant  exclaiming with vehemence it is you  vile wretch  that has attempted to steal into the cottage of the poor man  and then to rob him of his only child  and that child of her heart s blood  base ingrate my friend  you are wrong  entirely wrong  i am not the creature you believe me  i have slept  and slept soundly  and awoke not until your daughter screamed scoundrel liar base wretch  you shall not remain alive to injure those who have but one life to lose as he spoke  the ferryman made a desperate rush at the vampyre  and seized him by the throat  and a violent struggle ensued  in which the superior strength of the ferryman prevailed  and he brought his antagonist to the earth  at the same time bestowing upon him some desperate blows thou shall go to the same element from which i took thee  said the ferryman  and there swim or sink as thou wilt until some one shall drag thee ashore  and when they do  may they have a better return than i as he spoke  he dragged along the stranger by main force until they came to the bank of the river  and then pausing  to observe the deepest part he said here  then  you shall go the vampyre struggled  and endeavoured to speak  but he could not  the grasp at his throat prevented all attempts at speech  and then  with a sudden exertion of his strength  the ferryman lifted the stranger up and heaved him some distance into the river then in deep water sank the body the ferryman watched for some moments  and farther down the stream he saw the body again rise upon the current and struggling slightly  as for life now whirled around and around  and then carried forward with the utmost velocity this continued as far as the moonlight enabled the ferryman to see  and then  with a slow step and clouded brow  he returned to his cottage which he entered  and closed the door chapter xc dr  chillingworth at the hall the encounter of mystery the conflict the rescue  and the picture illustration there have been many events that have passed rapidly in this our narrative  but more have yet to come before we can arrive at that point which will clear up much that appears to be most mysterious and unaccountable doctor chillingworth  but ill satisfied with the events that had yet taken place  determined once more upon visiting the hall  and there to attempt a discovery of something respecting the mysterious apartment in which so much has already taken place he communicated his design to no one  he resolved to prosecute the inquiry alone  he determined to go there and await whatever might turn up in the shape of events  he would not for once take any companion such adventures were often best prosecuted alone they were most easily brought to something like an explanatory position  one person can often consider matters more coolly than more  at all events  there is more secrecy than under any other circumstances perhaps this often is of greater consequence than many others  and moreover  when there is more than one  something is usually overdone where one adventurous individual will rather draw back in a pursuit more than one would induce them to urge each other on in fact  one in such a case could act the part of a spy a secret observer  and in that case can catch people at times when they could not under any other circumstances be caught or observed at all i will go  he muttered  and should i be compelled to run away again why  nobody knows anything about it and nobody will laugh at me this was all very well  but mr  chillingworth was not the man to run away without sufficient cause  but there was so much mystery in all this that he felt much interested in the issue of the affair  but this issue he could not command  at the same time he was determined to sit and watch  and thus become certain that either something or nothing was to take place even the knowledge of that much that some inexplicable action was still going on was far preferable to the uncertainty of not knowing whether what had once been going on was still so or not  because  if it had ceased  it was probable that nothing more would ever be known concerning it  and the mystery would still be a mystery to the end of time it shall be fathomed if there be any possibility of its being discovered  muttered chillingworth  who would have thought that so quiet and orderly a spot as this  our quiet village  would have suffered so much commotion and disturbance  far from every cause of noise and strife  it is quite as great a matter of mystery as the vampyre business itself i have been so mixed up in this business that i must go through with it  by the way  of the mysteries  the greatest that i have met with is the fact of the vampyre having anything to do with so quiet a family as the bannerworths mr  chillingworth pondered over the thought  but yet he could make nothing of it  it in no way tended to elucidate anything connected with the affair  and it was much too strange and singular in all its parts to be submitted to any process of thought  with any hope of coming to anything like a conclusion upon the subject that must remain until some facts were ascertained  and to obtain them mr  chillingworth now determined to try this was precisely what was most desirable in the present state of affairs  while things remained in the present state of uncertainty there would be much more of mystery than could ever be brought to light one or two circumstances cleared up  the minor ones would follow in the same train  and they would be explained by the others  and if ever that happy state of things were to come about  why  then there would be a perfect calm in the town as mr  chillingworth was going along  he thought he observed two men sitting inside a hedge  close to a hay rick  and thinking neither of them had any business there  he determined to listen to their conversation  and ascertain if it had any evil tendency  or whether it concerned the late event having approached near the gate  and they being on the other side  he got over without any noise  and  unperceived by either of them  crept close up to them so you haven t long come from sea no  i have just landed how is it you have thrown aside your seaman s clothes and taken to these just to escape being found out found out  what do you mean by that  have you been up to anything yes  i have  jack  i have been up to something  worse luck to me  but i m not to be blamed either what is it all about  inquired his companion  i always thought you were such a steady going old file that there was no going out of the even path with you nor would there have been  but for one simple circumstance what was that i will tell you  jack i will tell you  you will never betray me  i am sure never  by heavens well  then  listen it was this  i had been some time aboard our vessel  i had sailed before  but the captain never showed any signs of being a bad man  and i was willing enough to sail with him again he knew i was engaged to a young woman in this country  and that i was willing to work hard to save money to make up a comfortable home for us both  and that i would not sail again  but that i intended to remain ashore  and make up my mind to a shore life well  you would have a house then exactly  and that s what i wished to do  well  i made a small venture in the cargo  and thought  by so doing  that i should have a chance of realizing a sum of money that would put us both in a comfortable line of business well  we went on very smoothly until we were coming back  we had disposed of the cargo  and i had received some money  and this seemed to cause our captain to hate me  because i had been successful  but i thought there was something else in it than that  but i could not tell what it was that made him so intolerably cross and tyrannous well  i found out  at length  he knew my intended wife  he knew her very well  and at the same time he made every effort he could to induce me to commit some act of disobedience and insubordination  but i would not  for it seemed to me he was trying all he could to prevent my doing my duty with anything like comfort however  i learned the cause of all this afterwards  it was told me by one of the crew bill  said my mate  look out for yourself what s in the wind  said i only the captain has made a dead set at you  and you ll be a lucky man if you escape what s it all about  said i  i cannot understand what he means  i have done nothing wrong  i don t see why i should suddenly be treated in this way it s all about your girl  bill indeed  said i  what can that have to do with the captain  he knows nothing of her oh  yes  he does  he said  if it were not for you he would have the girl himself i see now  said i ay  and so can a blind man if you open his eyes  but he wants to make you do wrong to goad you on to do something that will give him the power of disgracing you  and  perhaps  of punishing you he won t do that  said i i am glad to hear you say so  bill  for  to my mind  he has made up his mind to go the whole length against you  i can t make it out  unless he wishes you were dead i dare say he does  said i  but i will take care i will live to exact a reckoning when he comes ashore that is the best  and when we are paid off  bill  if you will take it out of him  and pay him off  why  i don t care if i lend you a hand we ll say more about that  dick  said i  when we get ashore and are paid off  if we are overheard now  it will be said that we are conspiring  or committing mutiny  or something of that sort you are right  bill  he said you are right  we ll say no more about this now  but you may reckon upon me when we are no longer under his orders then there s no danger  you know well  we said nothing about this  but i thought of it  and i had cause enough  too  to think of it  for each day the captain grew more and more tyrannous and brutal  i knew not what to do  but kept my resolution of doing my duty in spite of all he could do  though i don t mind admitting i had more than one mind to kill him and myself afterwards however  i contrived to hold out for another week or two  and then we came into port  and were released from his tyranny  i got paid off  and then i met my messmate  and we had some talk about the matter the worst of it is  said i  we shall have some difficulty to catch him  and  if we can  i ll be sworn we shall give him enough to last him for at least a voyage or two he ought to have it smart  said my messmate  and i know where he is to be found do you at what hour late at night  when he may be met with as he comes from a house where he spends his evenings that will be the best time in the world  when we shall have less interference than at any other time in the day  but we ll have a turn to night if you will be with me  as he will be able to make too good a defence to one  it will be a fight  and not a chastisement it will  i will be with you  you know where to meet me  i shall be at the old spot at the usual time  and then we will go we parted  and  in the evening  we both went together  and sought the place where we should find him out  and set upon him to advantage he was nearly two hours before he came  but when he did come  we saluted him with a rap on the head  that made him hold his tongue  and then we set to  and gave him such a tremendous drubbing  that we left him insensible  but he was soon taken away by some watchmen  and we heard that he was doing well  but he was dreadfully beaten  indeed  it would take him some weeks before he could be about in his duties he was fearfully enraged  and offered fifty pounds reward to any one who could give him information as to who it was that assaulted him i believe he had a pretty good notion of who it was  but he could not swear to me  but still  seeing he was busying himself too much about me i at once walked away  and went on my way to another part of the country to get married ay  and to get into business then  things are not quite so bad as i thought for at first no no  not so bad but what they might have been worse a great deal only i cannot go to sea any more  that s quite certain you needn t regret that i don t know why not know  are you not going to be married ain t that much better i can t say  replied the sailor  there s no knowing how my bargain may turn out  if she does well  why  then the cruising is over  but nothing short of that will satisfy me  for if my wife is at all not what i wish her to be  why  i shall be off to sea i don t blame you  either  i would do so too  if it were possible  but you see  we can t do so well on land as you do at sea  we can be followed about from pillar to post  and no bounds set to our persecution that s true enough  said the other  we can cut and run when we have had enough of it  however  i must get to the village  as i shall sleep there to night  if i find my quarters comfortable enough come on  then  at once  said his companion  it s getting dark now and you have no time to lose these two now got up  and walked away towards the village  and chillingworth arose also  and pursued his way towards the hall  while he remarked to himself well well  they have nothing to do with that affair at all events by the bye  i wonder what amount of females are deserted in the navy they certainly have an advantage over landsmen  in the respect of being tied to tiresome partners  they can  at least  for a season  get a release from their troubles  and be free at sea however  mr  chillingworth got to the hall  and unobserved  for he had been especially careful not to be seen  he had watched on all sides  and no signs of a solitary human being had he seen  that could in any way make the slightest observation upon him indeed  he had sheltered himself from observation at every point of his road  especially so when near bannerworth hall  where there were plenty of corners to enable him to do so  and when he arrived there  he entered at the usual spot  and then sat down a few moments in the bower i will not sit here  he muttered  i will go and have a watch at that mysterious picture  there is the centre of attraction  be it what it may as he spoke  he arose and walked into the house  and entered the same apartment which has been so often mentioned to the reader here he took a chair  and sat down full before the picture  and began to contemplate it well  for a good likeness  i cannot say i ever saw anything more unprepossessing  i am sure such a countenance as that could never have won a female heart  surely  it is more calculated to terrify the imagination  than to soothe the affections of the timid and shrinking female however  i will have an inspection of the picture  and see if i can make anything of it as he spoke  he put his hand upon the picture with the intention of removing it  when it suddenly was thrust open  and a man stepped down the doctor was for a moment completely staggered  it was so utterly unexpected  and he stepped back a pace or two in the first emotion of his surprise  but this soon passed by  and he prepared to close with his antagonist  which he did without speaking a word there was a fair struggle for more than two or three minutes  during which the doctor struggled and fought most manfully  but it was evident that mr  chillingworth had met with a man who was his superior in point of strength  for he not only withstood the utmost force that chillingworth could bring against him  but maintained himself  and turned his strength against the doctor chillingworth panted with exertion  and found himself gradually losing ground  and was upon the point of being thrown down at the mercy of his adversary  who appeared to be inclined to take all advantages of him when an occurrence happened that altered the state of affairs altogether while they were struggling  the doctor borne partially to the earth but yet struggling  suddenly his antagonist released his hold  and staggered back a few paces there  you swab take that  i am yard arm and yard arm with you  you piratical looking craft you lubberly  buccaneering son of a fish fag before  however  jack pringle  for it was he who came so opportunely to the rescue of doctor chillingworth  could find time to finish the sentence  he found himself assailed by the very man who  but a minute before  he had  as he thought  placed hors de combat illustration a desperate fight ensued  and the stranger made the greatest efforts to escape with the picture  but found he could not get off without a desperate struggle  he was  at length  compelled to relinquish the hope of carrying that off  for both mr  chillingworth and jack pringle were engaged hand to hand  but the stranger struck jack so heavy a blow on the head  that made him reel a few yards  and then he escaped through the window  leaving jack and mr  chillingworth masters of the field  but by no means unscathed by the conflict in which they had been engaged chapter xci the grand consultation broken up by mrs  chillingworth  and the disappearance of varney illustration remarkable was the change that had taken place in the circumstances of the bannerworth family  from a state of great despondency  and  indeed absolute poverty  they had suddenly risen to comfort and independence it seemed as if the clouds that had obscured their destiny  had now with one accord  dissipated  and that a brighter day was dawning  not only had the circumstances of mental terror which had surrounded them given way in a great measure to the light of truth and reflection  but those pecuniary distresses which had pressed upon them for a time  were likewise passing away  and it seemed probable that they would be in a prosperous condition the acquisition of the title deeds of the estate  which they thought had passed away from the family for ever  became to them  in their present circumstances  an immense acquisition  and brought to their minds a feeling of great contentment many persons in their situation would have been extremely satisfied at having secured so strong an interest in the mind of the old admiral  who was very wealthy  and who  from what he had already said and done  no doubt fully intended to provide handsomely for the bannerworth family and not only had they this to look forward to  if they had chosen to regard it as an advantage  but they knew that by the marriage of flora with charles holland she would have a fortune at her disposal  while he charles  would be the last man in the world to demur at any reasonable amount of it being lavished upon her mother and her brothers but all this did not suit the high and independent spirit of henry bannerworth  he was one who would rather have eaten the dust that he procured for himself by some meritorious exertion  than have feasted on the most delicate viands placed before him from the resources of another but now that he knew this small estate  the title deeds of which had been so singularly obtained  had once really belonged to the family  but had been risked and lost at the gaming table  he had no earthly scruple in calling such property again his own as to the large sum of money which sir francis varney in his confessions had declared to have found its way into the possession of marmaduke bannerworth  henry did not expect  and scarcely wished to become possessed of wealth through so tainted a source no  he said to himself frequently  no i care not if that wealth be never forthcoming  which was so badly got possession of  let it sink into the earth  if  indeed  it be buried there  or let it rot in some unknown corner of the old mansion  i care not for it in this view of the case he was not alone  for a family more unselfish or who cared so little for money  could scarcely have been found  but admiral bell and charles holland argued now that they had a right to the amount of money which marmaduke bannerworth had hidden somewhere  and the old admiral reasoned upon it rather ingeniously  for he said i suppose you don t mean to dispute that the money belongs to somebody and in that case i should like to know who else it belonged to  if not to you  how do you get over that  master henry i don t attempt to get over it at all  said henry  all i say is  that i do dislike the whole circumstances connected with it  and the manner in which it was come by  and  now that we have a small independence  i hope it will not be found  but  admiral  we are going to hold a family consultation as to what we shall do  and what is to become of varney  he has convinced me of his relationship to our family  and  although his conduct has certainly been extremely equivocal  he has made all the amends in his power  and now  as he is getting old  i do not like to throw him upon the wide world for a subsistence you don t contemplate  said the admiral  letting him remain with you do you no  that would be objectionable for a variety of reasons  and i could not think of it for a moment i should think not  the idea of sitting down to breakfast  dinner  tea and supper with a vampyre  and taking your grog with a fellow that sucks other people s blood really  admiral  you do not really still cling to the idea that sir francis varney is a vampyre i really don t know  he clings to it himself  that s all i can say  and i think  under those circumstances  i might as well give him the benefit of his own proposition  and suppose that he is a vampyre really  uncle  said charles holland  i did think that you had discarded the notion did you  i have been thinking of it  and it ain t so desirable to be a vampyre  i am sure  that any one should pretend to it who is not therefore  i take the fellow upon his own showing  he is a vampyre in his own opinion  and so i don t see  for the life of me  why he should not be so in ours well  said henry  waving all that  what are we to do with him circumstances seem to have thrown him completely at our mercy  what are we to do with him  and what is to become of him for the future i ll tell you what i ll do  said the admiral  if he were ten times a vampyre  there is some good in the fellow  and i will give him enough to live upon if he will go to america and spend it  they will take good care there that he sucks no blood out of them  for  although an american would always rather lose a drop of blood than a dollar  they keep a pretty sharp look out upon both the proposal can be made to him  said henry  at all events  it is one which i don t dislike  and probably one that he would embrace at once because he seems  to me  to have completely done with ambition  and to have abandoned those projects concerning which  at one time  he took such a world of trouble don t you trust to that  said the admiral  what s bred in the bone don t so easily get out of the flesh  and once or twice  when master varney has been talking  i have seen those odd looking eyes of his flash up for a moment  as if he were quite ready to begin his old capers again  and alarm the whole country side i must confess  said charles holland  that i myself have had the impression once or twice that varney was only subdued for a time  and that  with a proper amount of provocation  he would become again a very serious fellow  and to the full as troublesome as he has been do you doubt his sincerity  said henry no  i do not do that  henry  i think varney fully means what he says but i think  at the same time  that he has for so long lead a strange wild  and reckless life  that he will find it very far from easy  if indeed possible  to shake off his old habits and settle down quietly  if not to say comfortably i regret  said henry  that you have such an impression  but  while i do so  i cannot help admitting that it is  to a considerable extent  no more than a reasonable one  and perhaps  after all  my expectation that varney will give us no more trouble  only amounts to a hope that he will not do so  and nothing more  but let us consider  there seems to be some slight difference of opinion among us  as to whether we should take up our residence at this new house of ours  which we did not know we owned at dearbrook  or proceed to london  and there establish ourselves  or again return to bannerworth hall  and  by a judicious expenditure of some money  make that a more habitable place than it has been for the last twenty years now  i ll tell you what  said the admiral  i would do  it s quite out of the question for any body to live long unless they see a ship  don t you think so  miss flora why  how can you ask flora such a question  uncle  said charles holland  when you know she don t care a straw about ships  and only looks upon admirals as natural curiosities excepting one  said flora  and he is an admiral who is natural but no curiosity  unless it be that you  can call him such because he is so just and generous  and  as for ships  who can help admiring them  and if admiral bell proposes that we live in some pleasant  marine villa by the sea coast  he shall have my vote and interest for the proceeding bravo  huzza  cried the admiral  i tell you what it is  master charley you horse marine i have a great mind to cut you out  and have miss flora myself don t  uncle  said charles  that would be so very cruel  after she has promised me so faithfully  how do you suppose i should like it  come now  be merciful at this moment  and before any one could make another remark  there came rather a sharp ring at the garden gate bell  and henry exclaimed that s mr  chillingworth  and i am glad he has come in time to join our conference  his advice is always valuable  and  moreover  i rather think he will bring us some news worth the hearing the one servant who they had to wait upon them looked into the room  and said if you please  here is mrs  chillingworth mistress  you mean mr no  it is mrs  chillingworth and her baby the devil  said the admiral  what can she want i ll come and let you know  said mrs  chillingworth  what i want and she darted into the room past the servant  i ll soon let you know you great sea crab  i want my husband  and what with your vampyre  and one thing and another  i haven t had him at home an hour for the past three weeks  what am i to do  there is all his patients getting well as fast as they can without him  and  when they find that out  do you think they will take any more filthy physic  no  to be sure not  people ain t such fools as to do anything of the sort i ll tell you what we will do  ma am  said the admiral  we ll all get ill at once  on purpose to oblige ye  and i ll begin by having the measles you are an old porpoise  and i believe it all owing to you that my husband neglects his wife and family  what s vampyres to him  i should like to know  that he should go troubling about them  i never heard of vampyres taking draughts and pills no  nor any body else that had the sense of a goose  said the admiral but if it s your husband you want  ma am  it s no use your looking for him here  for here he is not then where is he  he is running after some of your beastly vampyres somewhere  i ll be bound  and you know where to send for him then you are mistaken  for  indeed  we don t  we want him ourselves ma am  and can t find him that s the fact it s all very well talking  sir  but if you were a married woman  with a family about you  and the last at the breast  you d feel very different from what you do now i m d d if i don t suppose i should  said the admiral  but as for the last  ma am  i d soon settle that  i d wring its neck  and shove it overboard you would  you brute  it s quite clear to me you never had a child of your own mrs  chillingworth  said henry  i think you have no right to complain to us of your domestic affairs  where your husband goes  and what he does  is at his own will and pleasure  and  really  i don t see that we are to be made answerable as to whether he is at home or abroad  to say nothing of the bad taste and bad taste it most certainly is  of talking of your private affairs to other people oh  dear  said mrs  chillingworth  that s your idea  is it  you no whiskered puppy really  madam  i cannot see what my being destitute of whiskers has to do with the affair  and i am inclined to think my opinion is quite as good without them as with them i will speak  said flora  to the doctor  when i see him will you  miss doll s eyes  oh  dear me  you ll speak to the doctor will you what on earth do you want  said henry  for your husband s sake  whom we all respect  we wish to treat you with every imaginable civility  but we tell you  candidly  that he is not here  and  therefore  we cannot conceive what more you can require of us oh  it s a row  said the admiral  that s what she wants woman like d d a bit do they care what it s about as long as there s a disturbance  and now  ma am  will you sit down and have a glass of grog no  i will not sit down  and all i can say is  that i look upon this place as a den full of snakes and reptiles  that s my opinion  so i ll not stay any longer  but  wishing that great judgments may some day come home to you all  and that you may know what it is to be a mother  with five babies  and one at the breast  i despise you all and leave you so saying  mrs  chillingworth walked from the place  feeling herself highly hurt and offended at what had ensued  and they were compelled to let her go just as she was  without giving her any information  for they had a vivid recollection of the serious disturbance she had created on a former occasion  when she had actually headed a mob  for the purpose of hunting out varney  the vampyre  from bannerworth hall  and putting an end consequently  as she considered  to that set of circumstances which kept the doctor so much from his house  to the great detriment of a not very extensive practice after all  said flora  mrs  chillingworth  although she is not the most refined person in the world  is to be pitied what  cried the admiral  miss doll s eyes  are you taking her part oh  that s nothing  she may call me what she likes i believe she is a good wife to the doctor  said henry notwithstanding his little eccentricities  but suppose we now at once make the proposal we were thinking of to sir francis varney  and so get him to leave england as quickly as possible and put an end to the possibility of his being any more trouble to anybody agreed agreed  it s the best thing that can be done  and it will be something gained to get his consent at once i ll run up stairs to him  said charles  and call him down at once  i scarcely doubt for a moment his acquiescence in the proposal charles holland rose  and ran up the little staircase of the cottage to the room which  by the kindness of the bannerworth family  had been devoted to the use of varney  he had not been gone above two minutes when he returned  hastily  with a small scrap of paper in his hand which he laid before henry  saying there  what think you of that henry  upon taking up the paper  saw written upon it the words the farewell of varney the vampyre he is gone  said charles holland  the room is vacant  i saw at a glance that he had removed his hat  and cloak  and all that belonged to him  he s off  and at so short a warning  and in so abrupt a manner that i fear the worst what can you fear i scarcely know what  but we have a right to fear everything and anything from his most inexplicable being  whose whole conduct has been of that mysterious nature  as to put him past all calculation as regards his motives  his objects  or his actions  i must confess that i would have hailed his departure from england with feelings of satisfaction but what he means now  by this strange manoeuvre  heaven  and his own singular intellect  can alone divine i must confess  said flora  i should not at all have thought this of varney  it seems to me as if something new must have occurred to him altogether  i do not feel any alarm concerning his actions as regards us  i am convinced of his sincerity  and  therefore  do not view with sensations of uneasiness this new circumstance  which appears at present so inexplicable  but for which we may yet get some explanation that will be satisfactory to us all i cannot conceive  said henry  what new circumstances could have occurred to produce this effect upon varney  things remain just as they were  and  after all  situated as he is  if any change had taken place in matters out of doors  i do not see how he could become acquainted with them  so that his leaving must have been a matter of mere calculation  or of impulse at the moment heaven knows which but can have nothing to do with actual information  because it is quite evident he could not get it it is rather strange  said charles holland  that just as we were speculating upon the probability of his doing something of this sort  he should suddenly do it  and in this singular manner too oh  said the old admiral  i told you i saw his eye  that was enough for me  i knew he would do something  as well as i know a mainmast from a chain cable  he can t help it  it s in the nature of the beast  and that s all you can say about it chapter xcii the misadventure of the doctor with the picture the situation of dr  chillingworth and jack pringle was not of that character that permitted much conversation or even congratulation  they were victors it was true  and yet they had but little to boast of besides the victory victory is a great thing  it is like a gilded coat  it bewilders and dazzles  nobody can say much when you are victorious  what a sound  and yet how much misery is there not hidden beneath it this victory of the worthy doctor and his aid amounted to this  they were as they were before  without being any better  but much the worse seeing they were so much buffetted that they could hardly speak  but sat for some moments opposite to each other  gasping for breath  and staring each other in the face without speaking the moonlight came in through the window and fell upon the floor  and there were no sounds that came to disturb the stillness of the scene nor any object that moved to cast a shadow upon the floor  all was still and motionless  save the two victors  who were much distressed and bruised well  said jack pringle  with a hearty execration  as he wiped his face with the back of his hand  saving your presence  doctor  we are masters of the field  doctor  but it s plaguey like capturing an empty bandbox after a hard fight but we have got the picture  jack we have got the picture  you see and that is something  i am sure we saved that well  that may be  and a pretty d d looking picture it is after all why  it s enough to frighten a lady into the sulks  i think it would be a very good thing if it were burned well  said the doctor  i would sooner see it burned than in the hands of that what  exclaimed jack i don t know  said mr  chillingworth  but thief i should say  for it was somewhat thief like to break into another man s house and carry off the furniture a pirate a regular land shark something that is not the same as an honest man  jack  but  at all events  we have beaten him back this time yes  said jack  the ship s cleared  no company is better than bad company  doctor so it is  and yet it don t seem clear in terms  but  jack  it you hadn t come in time  i should have been but scurvily treated  he was too powerful for me  i was as nigh being killed as ever i have been  but you were just in time to save me well  he was a large  ugly fellow  sure enough  and looked like an old tree did you see him yes  to be sure i did well  i could not catch a glimpse of his features  in fact  i was too much employed to see anything  and it was much too dark to notice anything particular  even if i had had leisure why  you had as much to do as you could well manage  i must say that at all events  i didn t see much of him myself  only he was a tall out of the way sort of chap a long legged shark  he gave me such a dig or two as i haven t had for a long while  nor don t want to get again though i don t care if i face the devil himself  a man can t do more than do his best  doctor no  jack  but there are very few who do do their best  and that s the truth  you have  and have done it to some purpose too  but i have had enough for one day  he was almost strong enough to contend against us both yes  so he was and  besides that  he almost carried away the picture that was a great hindrance to him  don t you think we could have held him if we had not been fighting over the picture yes  to be sure we could  we could have gone at him bodily  and held him  he would not have been able to use his hands  we could have hung on him  and i am sure if i came to grapple yard arm and yard arm  he would have told a different tale  however  that is neither here nor there  how long had you been here not very long  replied the doctor  whose head was a little confused by the blows which he had received  i can t now tell how long  but only a short time  i think where did he come from  inquired jack come from  jack yes  doctor  where did he came from the window  i suppose the same way he went out  i dare say it s most likely oh  no  no  he come down from behind the picture  there s some mystery in that picture  i ll swear to it  it s very strange he should make such a desperate attempt to carry it away yes  one would think  said jack  there was more in it than we can see that it is worth more than we can believe  perhaps somebody sets particular store by it i don t know  said mr  chillingworth  shaking his head  i don t know how that may be  but certain it is  the picture was the object of his visit here that is very certain it was  he was endeavouring to carry it off  said jack  it would be a very good ornament to the black hole at calcutta the utility of putting it where it cannot be seen  remarked mr chillingworth  i cannot very well see  though i dare say it might be all very well yes its ugly features would be no longer seen  so far  it would be a good job  but are you going to remain here all night  and so make a long watch of it  doctor why  jack  said the doctor  i did intend watching here  but now the game is disturbed  it is of no use remaining here  we have secured the picture  and now there will be no need of remaining in the house  in fact  there is no fear of robbery now not so long as we are here  said jack pringle  the smugglers won t show a head while the revenue cutter is on the look out certainly not  jack  said mr  chillingworth  i think we have scared them away the picture is safe yes so long as we are here and longer  too  i hope jack shook his head  as much as to intimate that he had many doubts upon such a point  and couldn t be hurried into any concession of opinion of the safety of such a picture as that much as he disliked it  and as poor an opinion as he had of it don t you think it will be safe no  said jack and why not  said mr  chillingworth  willing to hear what jack could advance against the opinion he had expressed  especially as he had disturbed the marauder in the very act of robbery why  you ll be watched by this very man  and when you are gone  he will return in safety  and take this plaguey picture away with him well  he might do so  said mr  chillingworth  after some thought  he even endangered his own escape for the purpose of carrying it off he wants it  said jack what  the picture aye  to be sure  do you think anybody would have tried so hard to get away with it  he wants it  and the long and the short of it is  he will have it  despite all that can be done to prevent it  that s my opinion well  there is much truth in that  but what to do i don t know take it to the cottage  suggested jack  the picture must be more than we think for  suppose we carry it along that is no bad plan of yours  jack  said mr  chillingworth  and though a little awkward  yet it is not the worst i have heard but but what will they say  when they see this frightful face in that quiet  yet contented house why  they ll say you brought it  said jack  i don t see what else they can say  but that you have done well  besides  when you come to explain  you will make the matter all right to em yes  yes  said chillingworth  and  as the picture now seems to be the incomprehensible object of attack  i will secure that  at all events i ll help you thank you  jack  your aid will be welcome  at least  it was so just now all right  doctor  said jack  i may be under your hands some day i ll physic you for nothing  said mr  chillingworth  you saved my life  one good turn deserves another  i ll not forget thank you  said jack  as he made a wry face  i hope you won t have occasion  i d sooner have a can of grog than any bottle of medicine you can give me  i ain t ungrateful  neither you needn t name it  i am getting my breath again  i suppose we had better leave this place  as soon as we conveniently can exactly  the sooner the better  we can take it the more leisurely as we go the moon was up  there were no clouds now  but there was not a very strong light  because the moon was on the wane  it was one of those nights during which an imperceptible vapour arises  and renders the moon somewhat obscure  or  at least  it robs the earth of her rays  and then there were shadows cast by the moon  yet they grew fainter  and those cast upon the floor of the apartment were less distinct than at first there seemed scarce a breath of air stirring  everything was quiet and still  no motion no sound  save that of the breathing of the two who sat in that mysterious apartment  who gazed alternately round the place and then in each other s countenances  suddenly  the silence of the night was disturbed by a very slight  but distinct noise  which struck upon them with peculiar distinctness  it was a gentle tap  tap  at the window  as if some one was doing it with their fingernail they gazed on each other  for some moments  in amazement  and then at the window  but they saw nothing  and yet  had there been anything  they must have seen it  but there was not even a shadow well  said mr  chillingworth  after he had listened to the tap  tap several times  without being able to find out or imagine what it could arise from  what on earth can it be don t know  said jack  very composedly  squinting up at the window can t see anything well  but it must be something  persisted mr  chillingworth  it must be something i dare say it is  but i don t see anything  i can t think what it can be  unless unless what  speak out  said the doctor  impatiently why  unless it is davy jones himself  tapping with his long finger nails  a telling us as how we ve been too long already here then  i presume  we may as well go  and yet i am more disposed to deem it some device of the enemy to dislodge us from this place  for the purpose of enabling them to effect some nefarious scheme or other they have afloat it may be  and is  i dare say  a do of some sort or other  said jack but what  can it be there it is again  said the doctor  don t you hear it  i can  as plain as i can hear myself yes  said jack  i can hear it plain enough  and can see it  too  and that is more  yes  yes  i can tell all about it plain enough you can  well  then  shew me  said the doctor  as he strode up to the window  before which jack was standing gazing upon one particular spot of the shattered window with much earnestness where is it look there  said jack  pointing with his finger to a particular spot to which the doctor directed his attention  expecting to see a long skinny hand tapping against the glass  but he saw nothing where is it do you see that twig of ivy  or something of the sort  inquired jack yes  i do very well  watch that  and when the wind catches it and there is but very little it lifts it up  and then  falling down again  it taps the glass just as he spoke  there came a slight gust of wind  and it gave a practical illustration to his words  for the tapping was heard as often as the plant was moved by the wind well  said mr  chillingworth  however simple and unimportant the matter may be  yet i cannot but say i am always well pleased to find a practical explanation of it  so that there will be no part left in doubt there is none about that  said jack none  well  we are not beset  then  we may as well consider of the manner of our getting clear of this place  what sort of burthen this picture may be i know not  but i will make the attempt to carry it avast  there  said jack  i will carry it  at all events  i ll take the first spell  and  if i can t go on  we ll turn and turn about we can divide the weight from the first  and then neither of us will be tired at all just as you please  sir  said jack pringle  i am willing to obey orders  and  if we are to get in to night before they are all a bed  we had better go at once  and then we shall not disturb them good  jack  said mr  chillingworth  very good  let us begin to beat our retreat at once very good  said jack they both rose and approached the picture  which stood up in one corner half reclining against the wall  the light  at least so much as there was  fell upon it  and gave it a ghastly and deathly hue  which made mr chillingworth feel an emotion he could not at all understand  but  as soon as he could  he withdrew his eyes from off the picture  and they proceeded to secure it with some cord  so that they might carry it between them the easier with less trouble and more safety these preparations did not take long in making  and  when completed they gave another inquiring look round the chamber  and mr chillingworth again approached the window  and gazed out upon the garden below  but saw nothing to attract his attention turning away  he came to the picture  with which jack pringle had been standing  they proceeded towards the stairs  adopting every precaution they could take to prevent any surprise and any attempt upon the object of their solicitude then they came to the great hall  and  having opened the door  they carried it out  then shutting the door  they both stood outside of bannerworth hall  and  before taking the picture up in their hands  they once more looked suspiciously around them there was nothing to be seen  and so  shouldering the ominous portrait they proceeded along the garden till they conveyed it into the roadway now  said jack  we are off  we can scud along under press of sail you know i would rather not  said the doctor  for two reasons  one of which is  i can t do it myself  and the other is  we should run the risk of injuring the picture  besides this  there is no reason for so doing very well  said jack  make it agreeable to yourself  doctor  see you jack s alive  and i am willing to do all i can to help you i am very glad of your aid  said mr  chillingworth  so we will proceed slowly  i shall be glad when we are there  for there are few things more awkward than this picture to carry it is not heavy  said jack  giving it a hitch up  that first pulled the doctor back  and then pushed him forward again no  but stop  don t do that often  jack  or else i shall be obliged to let go  to save myself from falling  said the doctor very sorry  said jack  hope it didn t inconvenience you  but i could carry this by myself and so could i  returned mr  chillingworth  but the probability is there would be some mischief done to it  and then we should be doing more harm than good so we should  said jack they proceeded along with much care and caution  it was growing late now  and no one was about at least  they met none  people did not roam about much after dark  especially since the reports of the vampyre became current  for  notwithstanding all their bravery and violence while in a body  yet to meet and contend with him singly  and unseen was not at all a popular notion among them  indeed  they would sooner go a mile out of their way  or remain in doors  which they usually did the evening was not precisely dark  there was moonlight enough to save it from that  but there was a mist hanging about  that rendered objects at a short distance  very indistinct their walk was uninterrupted by any one  and they had got through half the distance without any disturbance or interruption whatever when they arrived at the precincts of the village  jack pringle said to dr  chillingworth  do you intend going through the village  doctor why not  there will be nobody about  and if there should be  we shall be safe enough from any molestation  seeing there are none here who would dare to harm us  it is the shortest way  too very good  said jack  i am agreeable  and as for any one harming me they know better  but  at all events  there s company  and there s less danger  you know  doctor  though i m always company to myself  but haven t any objection to a messmate  now and then they pursued their way in silence  for some distance  the doctor not caring about continuing the talk of jack  which amounted to nothing besides  he had too much to do  for  notwithstanding the lightness of the picture  which jack had endeavoured to persuade the doctor of  he found it was heavy and ungainly  indeed  had he been by himself he would have had some trouble to have got it away we are nearly there  said jack  putting down his end of the picture which brought doctor chillingworth to a standstill yes  we are  but what made you stop why  you see  said jack  giving his trowsers a hitch  as i said before  we are nearly there well  what of that  we intended to go there  did we not  inquired chillingworth yes  exactly  that is  you intended to do so  i know  but i didn t what do you mean by that  inquired chillingworth  you are a complete riddle to night  jack  what is the matter with you nothing  only  you see  i don t want to go into the cottage  cause you see  the admiral and i have had what you may call a bit of a growl and i am in disgrace there a little  though i don t know why  or wherefore  i always did my duty by him  as i did by my country  the ould man  however  takes fits into his head  at the same time i shall take some too  jack s as good as his master  ashore  at all events well  then  you object to go in  said chillingworth that is the state of the case  not that i m afraid  or have any cause to be ashamed of myself  but i don t want to make anybody else uncomfortable  by causing black looks very well  jack  said the doctor  i am much obliged to you  and  if you don t like to come  i won t press you against your inclination i understand  doctor  i will leave you here  if you can manage the rest of the way by yourself  there are not two hundred yards now to go  so you are all safe  so good bye good bye  jack  said doctor chillingworth  who stood wiping his forehead  whilst the picture was standing up against the poles do you want a hand up first no  thank you  i can get it up very well without any trouble it s not so heavy good bye  then  said jack  and  in a few moments more  jack pringle was out of sight  and the doctor was alone with the ominous picture  he had not far to go  and was within hail of the cottage  but it was late and yet he believed he should find them up  for the quietude and calmness of the evening hour was that which most chimed with their feelings  at such a time they could look out upon the face of nature and the freedom of thought appeared the greater  because there was no human being to clash with the silence and stillness of the scene well  muttered chillingworth  i ll go at once to the cottage with my burthen  how they will look at me  and wonder what could induce me to bring this away  i can hardly help smiling at the thought of how they will look at the apparition i shall make thus filled with notions that appeared to please him  the doctor shouldered the picture  and walked slowly along until he reached the dead wall that ran up to the entrance  or nearly so  of the gardens there was a plantation of young trees that overhung the path  and cast a deep shadow below a pleasant spot in hot weather the doctor had been carrying the picture  resting the side of it on the small of his arm  and against his shoulder  but this was an inconvenient posture  because the weight of the picture cut his arm so much  that he was compelled to pause  and shift it more on his shoulder there  he muttered  that will do for the present  and last until i reach the cottage garden he was proceeding along at a slow and steady pace  bestowing all his care and attention to the manner of holding the picture  when he was suddenly paralysed by the sound of a great shout of such a peculiar character  that he involuntarily stopped  and the next moment  something heavy came against him with great force  just as if a man had jumped from the wall on to him this was the truth  for  in another moment  and before he could recover himself  he found that there was an attempt to deprive him of the picture this at once aroused him  and he made an instant and a vigorous defence but he was compelled to let go his hold of the picture  and turn to resist the infuriated attack that was now commenced upon himself for some moments it was doubtful who would be the victor  but the wind and strength of the doctor were not enough to resist the powerful adversary against whom he had to contend  and the heavy blows that were showered down upon him at first he was enabled to bear up against this attack  and then he returned many of the blows with interest  but the stunning effect of the blows he received himself  was such that he could not help himself  and felt his senses gradually failing  his strength becoming less and less in a short time  he received such a blow  that he was laid senseless on the earth in an instant how long he remained thus he could not say  but it could not have been long  for all around him seemed just as it was before he was attacked the moon had scarcely moved  and the shadows  such as they were  were falling in the same direction as before i have not been long here  he muttered  after a few moments reflection  but but he stopped short  for  on looking around him  he saw the object of his solicitude was gone  the picture was nowhere to be seen  it had been carried off the instant he had been vanquished gone  he said  in a low  disconsolate tone  and after all i have done he wiped his hand across his brow  and finding it cut  he looked at the back of his hand  and saw by the deep colour that it was blood  indeed he could now feel it trickle down his face what to do he hardly knew  he could stand  and after having got upon his feet  he staggered back against the wall  against which he leaned for support  and afterwards he crept along with the aid of its support until he came to the door he was observed from the window  where henry and charles holland  seeing him come up with such an unsteady gait  rushed to the door to ascertain what was the matter what  doctor  exclaimed henry bannerworth  what is the matter i am almost dead  i think  said chillingworth  lend me your arm henry henry and charles holland immediately stepped out  and took him between them into the parlour  and placed him upon a couch what on earth has happened  doctor have you got into disgrace with the populace no  no  give me some drink some water  i am very faint very faint give him some wine  or  what s better  some grog  said the admiral why  he s been yard arm with some pirate or other  and he s damaged about the figure head  you ain t hurt in your lower works  are you doctor  said the admiral but the doctor took no notice of the inquiry  but eagerly sipped the contents of a glass that charles holland had poured out of a bottle containing some strong hollands  and which appeared to nerve him much there  said the admiral  that will do you good  how did all this damage to your upper works come about  eh let him wash his face and hands first  he will be better able to talk afterwards oh  thank you  said chillingworth  i am much better  but i have had some hard bruises how did it happen i went by myself to watch in the room where the picture was in bannerworth hall where the picture was  said henry  where it is  you mean  do you not doctor no  where it was  and where it is not now gone yes  gone away  i ll tell you all about it  i went there to watch  but found nobody or nothing there  but suddenly a man stepped out from behind the picture  and we had a fight over it  after which  just as i was getting the worst of it  jack pringle came in the dog  muttered the admiral yes  he came in just in time  i believe  to save my life  for the man whoever he was  would not have hesitated about it well  jack is a good man  said the admiral  there may be worse  at least well  we had a desperate encounter for some minutes  during which this fellow wanted to carry off the picture carry off the picture yes  we had a struggle for that  but we could not capture him  he was so violent that he broke away and got clear off with the picture no  he left the picture behind  well  we were very tired and bruised and we sat down to recover ourselves from our fatigue  and to consider what was best to be done  but we were some time before we could leave and then we determined that we would take the picture away with us  as it seemed to be coveted by the robber  for what object we cannot tell well  well where is the picture you shall hear all about it in a minute  if you ll let me take my time i am tired and sore  well  we brought the picture out  and jack helped me carry it till he came within a couple of hundred yards of the cottage  and there left me the lubber  said the admiral  interjectionally well  i rested awhile  and then taking the picture on my shoulders  i proceeded along with it until i came to the wall  when suddenly i heard a great shout  and then down came something heavy upon me  just as if a man had jumped down upon me and and yes  said the doctor  it was was what  inquired the admiral just what you all seemed to anticipate  you are all before me  but that was it a man yes  i had a struggle with him  and got nearly killed  for i am not equal to him in strength  i was sadly knocked about  and finally all the senses were knocked out of me  and i was  i suppose  left for dead and what became of the picture i don t know  but i suppose it was taken away  as  when i came to myself  it was gone  indeed  i have some faint recollection of seeing him seize the portrait as i was falling there was a pause of some moments  during which all the party appeared to be employed with their own thoughts  and the whole were silent do you think it was the same man who attacked you in the house that obtained the picture  at last inquired henry bannerworth i cannot say  but i think it most probable that it was the same indeed  the general appearance  as near as i could tell in the dark  was the same  but what i look upon as much stronger is  the object appears to be the same in both cases that is very true  said henry bannerworth very true  and i think it more than probable myself  but come  doctor  you will require rest and nursing after your dangers chapter xciii the alarm at anderbury the suspicions of the bannerworth family  and the mysterious communication illustration about twenty miles to the southward of bannerworth hall was a good sized market town  called anderbury  it was an extensive and flourishing place  and from the beauty of its situation  and its contiguity to the southern coast of england  it was much admired  and  in consequence numerous mansions and villas of great pretension had sprang up in its immediate neighbourhood betides  there were some estates of great value  and one of these called anderbury on the mount  in consequence of the mansion itself which was of an immense extent  being built upon an eminence  was to be let  or sold this town of anderbury was remarkable not only for the beauty of its aspect  but likewise for the quiet serenity of its inhabitants  who were a prosperous  thriving race  and depended very much upon their own resources there were some peculiar circumstances why anderbury on the mount was to let  it had been for a great number of years in possession of a family of the name of milltown  who had resided there in great comfort and respectability  until an epidemic disorder broke out  first among the servants  and then spreading to the junior branches of the family  and from them to their seniors  produced such devastation  that in the course of three weeks there was but one young man left of the whole family  and he  by native vigour of constitution  had baffled the disorder  and found himself alone in his ancestral halls  the last of his race soon a settled melancholy took possession of him  and all that had formerly delighted him now gave him pain  inasmuch as it brought to his mind a host of recollections of the most agonising character in vain was it that the surrounding gentry paid him every possible attention  and endeavoured to do all that was in their power to alleviate the unhappy circumstances in which he was placed  if he smiled  it was in a sad sort  and that was very seldom  and at length he announced his intention of leaving the neighbourhood  and seeking abroad  and in change of scene  for that solace which he could not expect to find in his ancestral home  after what had occurred within its ancient walls there was not a chamber but which reminded him of the past there was not a tree or a plant of any kind or description but which spoke to him plainly of those who were now no more  and whose merry laughter had within his own memory made that ancient place echo with glee  filling the sunny air with the most gladsome shouts  such as come from the lips of happy youth long before the world has robbed it of any of its romance or its beauty there was a general feeling of regret when this young man announced the fact of his departure to a foreign land  for he was much respected  and the known calamities which he had suffered  and the grief under which he laboured  invested his character with a great and painful interest an entertainment was given to him upon the eve of his departure  and on the next day he was many miles from the place  and the estate of anderbury on the mount was understood to be sold or let the old mansion had remained  then  for a year or two vacant  for it was a place of too much magnitude  and required by far too expensive an establishment to keep it going  to enable any person whose means were not very large to think of having anything to do with it so  therefore  it remained unlet  and wearing that gloomy aspect which a large house  untenanted  so very quickly assumes it was quite a melancholy thing to look upon it  and to think what it must have once been  and what it might be still  compared to what it actually was  and the inhabitants of the neighbourhood had made up their minds that anderbury on the mount would remain untenanted for many a year to come  and  perhaps  ultimately fall into ruin and decay but in this they were doomed to be disappointed  for  on the evening of a dull and gloomy day  about one week after the events we have recorded as taking place at bannerworth hall and its immediate neighbourhood  a travelling carriage  with four horses and an out rider  came dashing into the place  and drew up at the principal inn in the town  which was called the anderbury arms the appearance of such an equipage  although not the most unusual thing in the world  in consequence of the many aristocratic families who resided in the neighbourhood  caused  at all events  some sensation and  perhaps  the more so because it drove up to the inn instead of to any of the mansions of the neighbourhood  thereby showing that the stranger  whoever he was  came not as a visitor  but either merely baited in the town  being on his road somewhere else  or had some special business in it which would soon be learned the out rider  who was in handsome livery  had gallopped on in advance of the carriage a short distance  for the purpose of ordering the best apartments in the inn to be immediately prepared for the reception of his master who is he  asked the landlord it s the baron stolmuyer saltsburgh bless my heart  i never heard of him before  where did he come from somewhere abroad i suppose i can t tell you anything of him further than that he is immensely rich  and is looking for a house  he has heard that there is one to let in this immediate neighbourhood  and that s what has brought him from london  i suppose yes  there is one  and it is called anderbury on the mount well  he will very likely speak to you about it himself  for here he comes by this time the carriage had halted at the door of the hotel  and  the door being opened  and the steps lowered  there alighted from it a tall man attired in a kind of pelisse  or cloak  trimmed with rich fur  the body of it being composed of velvet  upon his head he wore a travelling cap  and his fingers  as he grasped the cloak around him  were seen to be covered with rings of great value such a personage  coming in such style  was  of course  likely to be honoured in every possible way by the landlord of the inn  and accordingly he was shown most obsequiously to the handsomest apartment in the house  and the whole establishment was put upon the alert to attend to any orders he might choose to give he had not been long in the place when he sent for the landlord  who hastily scrambling on his best coat  and getting his wife to arrange the tie of his neckcloth  proceeded to obey the orders of his illustrious guest  whatever they might chance to be he found the baron stolmuyer reclining upon a sofa  and having thrown aside his velvet cloak  trimmed with rich fur  he showed that underneath it he wore a costume of great richness and beauty  although  certainly the form it covered was not calculated to set it off to any great advantage  for the baron was merely skin and bone  and looked like a man who had just emerged from a long illness  for his face was ghastly pale and the landlord could not help observing that there was a strange peculiarity about his eyes  the reason of which he could not make out you are the landlord of this inn  i presume  said the baron  and consequently  no doubt well acquainted with the neighbourhood i have the honour to be all that  sir  i have been here about sixteen years  and in that time i certainly ought to know something of the neighbourhood tis well  some one told me there was a little cottage sort of place to let here  and as i am simple and retired in my habits i thought that it might possibly suit me a little cottage  sir  there are certainly little cottages to let  but not such as would suit you  and if i might have presumed  sir  to think i should have considered anderbury on the mount  which is now to let would have been the place for you  it is a large place  sir  and belonged to a good family  although they are now all dead and gone except one  and it s he who wants to let the old place anderbury on the mount  said the baron  was the name of the place mentioned to me  but i understood it was a little place oh  sir  that is quite a mistake  who told you so  it s the largest place about here  there are a matter of twenty seven rooms in it  and it stands altogether upon three hundred acres of ground and have you the assurance  said the baron  to call that anything but a cottage  when the castle of the stolmuyers  at saltzburgh  has one suite of reception rooms thirty in number  opening into each other  and the total number of apartments in the whole building is two hundred and sixty  it is surrounded by eight miles of territory the devil  said the landlord  i beg your pardon  sir  but when i am astonished  i generally say the devil  they want eight hundred pounds a year for anderbury on the mount a mere trifle  i will sleep here to night  and in the morning i will go and look at the place  it is near the sea half a mile  sir  exactly  from the beach  and one of the most curious circumstances of all connected with it is  that there is a subterranean passage from the grounds leading right away down to the sea coast  a most curious place  sir  partly cut out of the cliff  with cellars in it for wine  and other matters  that in the height of summer are kept as cool as in the deep winter time  it s more for curiosity than use  such a place  and the old couple  that now take care of the house  make a pretty penny  i ll be bound  though they won t own it  by showing that part of the place it may suit me  but i shall be able to give a decisive answer when i see it on the morrow  you will let my attendants have what they require and see that my horses be well looked to certainly  oh  certainly  sir  of course  you might go far  indeed sir  before you found an inn where everything would be done as things are done here  is there anything in particular  sir  you would like for dinner how can i tell that  idiot  until the dinner time arrives well  but  sir  in that case  you know  we scarcely know what to do because you see  sir  you understand it is very strange to me that you can neither see nor understand your duty  i am accustomed to having the dinner tables spread with all that money can procure  then i choose  but not before  what it suits me to partake of wil  sir  that is a very good way  and perhaps we ain t quite so used to that sort of thing as we ought to be in these parts  but another time  sir  we shall know better what we are about  without a doubt  and i only hope  sir  that we shall have you in the neighbourhood for a long time  and so  sir  putting one thing to another  and then drawing a conclusion from both of them  you see  sir  you will be able to understand peace  begone  what is the use of all this bellowing to me i want it not i care not for it the baron spoke these words so furiously  that the landlord was rather terrified than otherwise  and left the room hastily  muttering to himself that he had never come across such a tiger  and wondering where the baron could have possibly come from  and what amount of wealth he could be possessed of  that would enable him to live in such a princely style as he mentioned if the baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh had wished ever so much to impress upon the minds of all persons in the neighbourhood the fact of his wealth and importance  he could not have adopted a better plan to accomplish that object than by first of all impressing such facts upon the mind of the landlord of the anderbury arms  for in the course of another hour it was tolerably well spread all over the town  that never had there been such a guest at the anderbury arms  and that he called anderbury on the mount  with all its rooms all its outbuildings  and its three hundred acres of ground  a cottage this news spread like wildfire  awaking no end of speculation  and giving rise to the most exaggerated rumours  so that a number of persons came to the inn on purpose to endeavour to get a look at the baron  but he did not stir from his apartments  so that these wondermongers were disappointed  and even forced to go away as wise as they came  but in the majority of cases they made up their minds that in the morning they should surely be able to obtain a glimpse of him  which was considered a great treat  for a man with an immense income is looked upon in england as a natural curiosity the landlord took his guest at his word as regards the dinner  and provided such a repast as seldom  indeed  graced the board at the anderbury arms a repast sufficient for twenty people  and certainly which was a monstrous thing to set before one individual the baron  however  made no remark  but selected a portion from some of the dishes  and those dishes that he did select from  were of the simplest kind  and not such as the landlord expected him to take  so that he really paid about one hundred times the amount he ought to have done for what actually passed his lips and then what a fidget the landlord was in about his wines  for he doubted not but such a guest would be extremely critical and hard to please  but  to his great relief  the baron declined taking any wine merely washing down his repast with a tumbler of cool water  and then although the hour was very early  he retired at once to rest the landlord was not disposed to disregard the injunction which the baron had given him to attend carefully on his servants and horses  and after giving orders that nothing should be stinted as regarded the latter  he himself looked to the creature comforts of the former  and he did this with a double motive  for not only was he anxious to make the most he could out of the baron in the way of charges  but he was positively panting with curiosity to know more about so singular a personage  and he thought that surely the servants must be able to furnish him with some particulars regarding their eccentric master in this  however  he was mistaken  for although they told him all they knew  that amounted to so little as really not to be worth the learning they informed him that they had been engaged all in the last week  and that they knew nothing of the baron whatever  or where he came from  or what he was  excepting that he paid them most liberal wages  and was not very exacting in the service he required of them this was very unsatisfactory  and when the landlord started on a mission  which he considered himself bound to perform  to a mr  leek  in the town  who had the letting of anderbury on the mount  he was quite vexed to think what a small amount of information he was able to carry to him i can tell him  he said to himself as he went quickly towards the agent s residence  i can tell him the baron s name  and that in the morning he wants to look at anderbury on the mount  but that s all i know of him  except that he is a most extraordinary man indeed  the most extraordinary that i ever came near mr  leek  the house agent  notwithstanding the deficiency of the facts contained in the landlord s statement  was well enough satisfied to hear that any one of apparent wealth was inquiring after the large premises to let  for  as he said truly to the landlord the commission on letting and receiving the rentals of such a property is no joke to me precisely  said the landlord  i thought it was better to come and tell you at once  for there can be no doubt that he is enormously rich if that be satisfactorily proved  it s of no consequence what he is  or who he is  and you may depend i shall be round to the inn early in the morning to attend upon him  and in that case  perhaps  if you have any conversation with him  you will be so good as to mention that i will show him over the premises at his own hour  and you shall not be forgotten  you may depend  if any arrangement is actually come to  it will be just as well for you to tell him what a nice property it is  and that it is to be let for eight hundred a year  or sold outright for eight thousand pounds i will  you may depend  mr  leek  a most extraordinary man you will find him  not the handsomest in the world  i can tell you  but handsome is as handsome does  say i  and  if he takes anderbury on the mount  i have no doubt but he will spend a lot of money in the neighbourhood  and we shall all be the better of that  of course  as you well know  sir this then was thoroughly agreed upon between these high contracting powers  and the landlord returned home very well satisfied  indeed  with the position in which he had put the affair  and resolved upon urging on the baron  as far as it lay within his power so to do  to establish himself in the neighbourhood  and to allow him to be purveyor in general to his household  which  if the baron continued in his liberal humour would be unquestionably a very pleasant post to occupy chapter xciv the visitor  and the death in the subterranean passage illustration about an hour and a half after the baron had retired to rest  and while the landlord was still creeping about enjoining silence on the part of the establishment  so that the slumbers of a wealthy and  no doubt illustrious personage should not be disturbed  there arrived a horseman at the anderbury arms he was rather a singular looking man  with a shifting  uneasy looking glance  as if he were afraid of being suddenly pounced upon and surprised by some one  and although his apparel was plain  yet it was good in quality  and his whole appearance was such as to induce respectful attention the only singular circumstance was  that such a traveller  so well mounted  should be alone  but that might have been his own fancy  so that the absence of an attendant went for nothing  doubtless  if the whole inn had not been in such a commotion about the illustrious and wealthy baron  this stranger would have received more consideration and attention than he did upon alighting  he walked at once into what is called the coffee room of the hotel  and after ordering some refreshments  of which he partook but sparingly  he said  in a mild but solemn sort of tone  to the waiter who attended upon him tell the baron stolmuyer  of saltzburgh  that there is one here who wants to see him i beg your pardon  sir  said the waiter  but the baron is gone to bed it matters not to me  if you nor no one else in this establishment will deliver the message i charge you with  i must do so myself i ll speak to my master  sir  but the baron is a very great gentleman indeed  and i don t think my master would like to have him disturbed the stranger hesitated for a time  and then he said show me the baron s apartment  perhaps i ought not to ask any one person connected with this establishment to disturb him  when i am quite willing to do so myself  show me the way well  but  sir  the baron may get in a rage  and say  very naturally that we had no business to let anybody walk up to his room and disturb him  because we wouldn t do so ourselves  so that you see  sir  when you come to consider  it hardly seems the right sort of thing since  said the stranger  rising  i cannot procure even the common courtesy of being shown to the apartment of the person whom i seek  i must find him myself as he spoke he walked out of the room  and began ascending the staircase  despite the remonstrances of the waiter  who called after him repeatedly  but could not induce him to stop  and when he found that such was the case  he made his way to the landlord  to give the alarm that  for all he knew to the contrary  some one had gone up stairs to murder the baron this information threw the landlord into such a fix  that he knew not what to be at  at one moment he was for rushing up stairs and endeavouring to interfere  and at another he thought the best plan would be to pretend that he knew nothing about it while he was in this state of uncertainty  the stranger succeeded in making his way up stairs to the floor from which proceeded the bedrooms and  apparently  having no fear whatever of the baron stolmuyer s indignation before his eyes  he opened door after door  until he came to one which led him into the apartment occupied by that illustrious individual the baron  half undressed only  lay in an uneasy slumber upon the bed and the stranger stood opposite to him for some minutes  as if considering what he should do it would be easy  he said  to kill him  but it will pay me better to spare him  i may be wrong in supposing that he has the means which i hope he has  but that i shall soon discover by his conversation stretching out  his hand  he tapped the baron lightly on the shoulder who thereupon opened his eyes and sprang to his feet instantly  glancing with fixed earnestness at the intruder  upon whose face shone the light of a lamp which was burning in the apartment then the baron shrunk back  and the stranger  folding his arms  said you know me  let our interview be as brief as possible  there needs no explanations between us  for we both know all that could be said  by some accident you have become rich  while i continue quite otherwise  it matters not how this has occurred  the fact is everything  i don t know the amount of your possessions  but  from your style of living  they must be great  and therefore it is that i make no hesitation in asking of you  as a price for not exposing who and what you are  a moderate sum i thought that you were dead i know you did  but you behold me here  and  consequently  that delusion vanishes what sum do you require  and what assurance can i have that  when you get it  the demand will not be repeated on the first opportunity i can give you no such assurance  perhaps  that would satisfy you entirely  but  for more reasons than i choose to enter into  i am extremely anxious to leave england at once and forever  give me the power to do so that i require  and you will never hear of me again illustration the baron hesitated for some few seconds  during which he looked scrutinizingly at his companion  and then he said  in a tone of voice that seemed as if he were making the remark to himself rather than to the other you look no older than you did when last we parted  and that was years ago why should i look older  you know as well as i that i need not  but  to be brief  i do not wish to interfere with any plans or projects you may have on hand  i do not wish to be a hindrance to you  let me have five thousand pounds  and i am off at once and forever  i tell you five thousand  the man raves five thousand pounds  say one thousand and it is yours no  i have fixed my price  and if you do not consent  i now tell you that i will blazon forth  even in this house  who and what you are  and let your schemes of ambition or of cupidity be what they may  you may be assured that i will blast them all this is no place in which to argue such a point  come out into the open air  walls have ears  but come out  and i will give you such special reasons why you should not now press your claim at all  that you shall feel much beholden to me for them  and not regret your visit if that we come to terms  i no more desire than you can do that any one should overhear our conversation  i prefer the open air for any conference  be it whatever it may much prefer it  and therefore most willingly embrace your proposition  come out the baron put on his travelling cap  and the rich velvet cloak  edged with fur  that he possessed  and leaving his chamber a few paces in advance of his strange visitor  he descended the staircase  followed by him  in the hall of the hotel they found the landlord and almost the whole of the establishment assembled  in deep consultation as to whether or not any one was to go up stairs and ascertain if the stranger who had sought the baron s chamber was really a friend or an enemy but when they saw the two men coming down  at all events apparently amicably  it was a great relief  and the landlord rushed forward and opened the door  for which piece of service he got a very stately bow from the baron  and a slight inclination of the head from his visitor and then they both passed out i have ascertained  said the man who came on horseback  that for the last week in london you have lived in a style of the most princely magnificence  and that you came down here  attended as if you were one of the first nobles of the land these things amuse the vulgar  said the baron  i do not mind admitting to you that i contemplate residing on this spot  and perhaps contracting a marriage another marriage and why not  if wives will die suddenly  and no one knows why  who is to help it  i do not pretend to control the fates this  between us  is idle talk indeed most idle  for we know there are certain circumstances which account for the strangest phenomena  but what roaring sound is that which comes so regularly and steadily upon the ear it is the sea washing upon the coast  the tide is no doubt advancing and  as the eddying surges roll in upon the pebbly shore  they make what  to my mind  is this pleasant music i did not think we were so near the ocean  the moon is rising  let us walk upon the beach  and as that sound is such pleasant music  you shall hear it while i convince you what unpleasant consequences will arise from a refusal of the modest and moderate terms i offer you we shall see  we shall see  but i must confess it does seem to me most extraordinary that you ask of me a positive fortune  for fear you should deprive me of a portion of one  but you cannot mean what you say while they were talking they reached a long strip of sand which was by the seashore  at the base of some cliffs  through which was excavated the passage from the coast into the grounds of anderbury house  and which had been so expatiated upon by the landlord of the inn  in his description of the advantages attendant upon that property there were some rude steps  leading to a narrow arched door way  which constituted an entrance to this subterraneous region  and as the moonlight streamed over the wide waste of waters  and fell upon this little door way in the face of the cliff  he became convinced that it was the entrance to that excavation  and he eyed it curiously what place is that  said his companion it is a private entrance to the grounds of a mansion in this neighbourhood private enough  i should presume  for if there be any other means of reaching the house  surely no one would go through such a dismal hole as that towards it  but come  make up your mind at once  there need be no quarrelling upon the subject of our conference  but let it be a plain matter of yes or no  is it worth your while to be left alone in peace or is it not it is worth my while  but not at such a price as that you mentioned and i cannot help thinking that some cheaper mode of accomplishing the same object will surely present itself very shortly i do not understand you  you talk ambiguously but my acts  said the baron  shall be clear and plain enough  as you shall see  could you believe it possible that i was the sort of person to submit tamely to any amount of extortion you chose to practise upon me  there was a time when i thought you possessed great sense and judgment when i thought that you were a man who weighed well the chances of what you were about  but now i know to the contrary  and i think for less than a thousand pounds i may succeed in ridding myself of you i do not understand you  you had better beware how you tamper with me for i am not one who will be calmly disposed to put up with much  the sense  tact  and worldly knowledge which you say you have before  from time to time  given me credit for  belongs to me still  and i am not likely easily to commit myself indeed  do you think you bear such a charmed life that nothing can shake it i think nothing of the sort  but i know what i can do i am armed and i  and since it comes to this  take the reward of your villany  for it was you who made me what i am  and would now seek to destroy my every hope of satisfaction as the baron spoke he drew from his breast a small pistol  which  with the quickness of thought  he held full in the face of his companion  and pulled the trigger there can be no doubt on earth that his intention was to commit the murder  but the pistol missed fire  and he was defeated in his intention at that moment  then the stranger laughed scornfully  and drawing a pistol from his pocket  he presented it at the baron s head  saying do i not bear a charmed life  if i had not  should i have escaped death from you now  no  i could not  but you perceive that even a weapon that might not fail you upon another occasion is harmless against me  and can you expect that i will hesitate now to take full and ample revenge upon you for this dastardly attempt these words were spoken with great volubility  so much so  indeed  that they only occupied a few very brief seconds in delivering  and then perhaps  the baron s career might have ended  for it seemed to be fully the intention of the other to conclude what he said by firing the pistol in his face  but the wily aspect of the baron s countenance was  after all  but a fair index of the mind  and  just as the last words passed the lips of his irritated companion  he suddenly dropped in a crouching position to the ground  and  seizing his legs  threw him over his head in an instant the pistol was discharged  at the same moment  and then  with a shout of rage and satisfaction  the baron sprang upon his foe  and  kneeling upon his breast  he held aloft in his hand a glittering dagger  the highly polished blade of which caught the moonbeams  and reflected them into the dazzled eyes of the conquered man  whose fate now appeared to be certain fool  said the baron  you must needs  then  try conclusions with me and  not content with the safety of insignificance  you must be absurd enough to think it possible you could extort from me whatever sums your fancy dictated  or with any effect threaten me  if i complied not with your desires have mercy upon me  i meant not to take your life  and  therefore  why should you take mine you would have taken it  and  therefore  you shall die  know  too  as this is your last moment  that  vampyre as you are  and as i  of all men  best know you to be  i will take especial care that you shall be placed in some position after death where the revivifying moonbeams may not touch you  so that this shall truly be your end  and you shall rot away  leaving no trace behind of your existence  sufficient to contain the vital principle no no  you cannot will not  you will have mercy ask the famished tiger for mercy  when you intrude upon his den as he spoke the baron ground his teeth together with rage  and  in an instant  buried the poniard in the throat of his victim  the blade went through to the yellow sand beneath  and the murderer still knelt upon the man s chest  while he who had thus received so fatal a blow tossed his arms about with agony  and tried in vain to shriek the nature of the wound  however  prevented him from uttering anything but a low gurgling sound  for he was nearly choked with his own blood and soon his eyes became fixed and of a glassy appearance  he stretched out his two arms  and dug his fingers deep into the sand the baron drew forth the poniard  and a gush of blood immediately followed it  and then one deep groan testified to the fact  that the spirit  if there be a spirit  had left its mortal habitation  and winged its flight to other realms  if there be other realms for it to wing its flight to he is dead  said the baron  and  at the same moment  a roll of the advancing tide swept over the body  drenching the living  as well as the dead  with the brine of the ocean the baron stooped and rinsed the dagger in the advancing tide from the clotted blood which had clung to it  and then  wiping it carefully  he returned it to its sheath  which was hidden within the folds of his dress  and  rising from his kneeling posture upon the body  he stood by its side  with folded arms  gazing upon it  for some minutes  in silence  heedless of the still advancing water  which was already considerably above his feet then he spoke in his ordinary accents  and evidently caring nothing for the fact that he had done such a deed i must dispose of this carcase  he said  which now seems so lifeless for the moon is up  and if its beams fall upon it  i know  from former experience  what will happen  it will rise again  and walk the earth seeking for vengeance upon me  and the thirst for that vengeance will become such a part of its very nature  that it will surely accomplish something  if not all that it desires after a few moments  consideration  he stooped  and  with more strength than one would have thought it possible a man reduced almost  as he was to a skeleton could have exerted  he lifted the body  and carried it rapidly up the beach towards the cliffs  he threw it down upon the stone steps that led to the small door of the excavation in the cliff  and it fell upon them with a sickening sound  as if some of the bones were surely broken by the fall the object  then  of the baron seemed to be to get this door open  if he possibly could  but that was an object easier to be desired than carried into effect  for  although he exerted his utmost power  he did not succeed in moving it an inch  and he began evidently to think that it would be impossible to do so but yet he did not give up the attempt at once  but looking about upon the beach  until he found a large heavy stone  he raised it in his arms and  approaching the door  he flung it against it with such tremendous force  that it flew open instantly  disclosing within a dark and narrow passage apparently rejoiced that he had accomplished this much  he stopped cautiously within the entrance  and then  taking from a concealed pocket that was in the velvet cloak which he wore a little box  he produced from it some wax lights and some chemical matches  which  by the slightest effort  he succeeded in igniting  and then  with one of the lights in his hand to guide him on his way  he went on exploring the passage  and treading with extreme caution as he went  for fear of falling into any of the ice wells which were reported to be in that place after proceeding about twenty yards  and finding that there was no danger  he became less cautious  but  in consequence of such less caution  he very nearly sacrificed his life  for he came upon an ice well which seemed a considerable depth  and into which he had nearly plunged headlong he started back with some degree of horror  but that soon left him  and then  after a moment s thought  he sought for some little nook in the wall  in which he might place the candle  and soon finding one that answered the purpose well  he there left it  having all the appearance of a little shrine  while he proceeded again to the mouth of that singular and cavernous looking place  he had  evidently  quite made up his mind what to do  for  without a moment s hesitation  he lifted the body again  and carried it within the entrance  walking boldly and firmly  now that he knew there was no danger between him and the light which shed a gleam through the darkness of the place of a very faint and flickering character he reached it rapidly  and when he got to the side of the well  he without a moment s hesitation  flung it headlong down  and  listening attentively  he heard it fall with a slight plash  as if there was some water at the bottom of the pit it was an annoyance  however  for him to find that the distance was not so deep as he had anticipated  and when he took the light from the niche where he had placed it  and looked earnestly down  he could see the livid  ghastly looking face of the dead man  for the body had accidentally fallen upon its back  which was a circumstance he had not counted upon  and one which increased the chances greatly of its being seen  should any one be exploring  from curiosity  that not very inviting place this was annoyance  but how could it be prevented  unless  indeed  he chose to descend  and make an alteration in the disposition of the corpse  but this was evidently what he did not choose to do  so  after muttering to himself a few words expressive of his intention to leave it where it was  he replaced the candle  after extinguishing it  in the box from whence he had taken it  and carefully walked out of the dismal place the moonbeams were shining very brightly and beautifully upon the face of the cliffs  when he emerged from the subterranean passage  so that he could see the door  the steps  and every object quite distinctly  and to his gratification  he found that he had not destroyed any fastening that was to the door  but that when it was slammed shut  it struck so hard and fast  that the strength of one man could not possibly move it even the smallest fraction of an inch i shall be shown all this to morrow  he said  and if i take this house i must have an alteration made in this door  so that it may open with a lock  instead of by main violence  as at present  but if  in the morning  when i view anderbury house  i can avoid an entrance into this region  i will do so  and at my leisure  if i become the possessor of the estate  i can explore every nook and cranny of it he then folded his cloak about him  after pulling the door as closely as he could  he walked slowly and thoughtfully back to the inn  it was quite evident that the idea of the murder he had committed did not annoy him in the least  and that in his speculations upon the subject he congratulated himself much upon having so far succeeded in getting rid of certainly a most troublesome acquaintance tis well  indeed  he said  that just at this juncture he should throw himself in my way  and enable me so easy to feel certain that i shall never more be troubled with him  truly  i ran some risk  and when my pistol missed fire  it seemed as if my evil star was in its ascendant  and that i was doomed myself to become the victim of him whom i have laid in so cold a grave  but i have been victorious  and i am willing to accept the circumstance as an omen of the past that my fortunes are on the change  i think i shall be successful now  and with the ample means which i now possess  surely  in this country  where gold is loved so well  i shall be able to overcome all difficulties  and to unite myself to some one  who but no matter  her fate is an after consideration chapter xcv the marriage in the bannerworth family arranged illustration after the adventure of the doctor with regard to the picture about which such an air of mystery and interest has been thrown  the bannerworth family began to give up all hopes of ever finding a clue to those circumstances concerning which they would certainly have liked to have known the truth  but of which it was not likely they would ever hear anything more dr  chillingworth now had no reserve  and when he had recovered sufficiently to feel that he could converse without an effort  he took an opportunity  while the whole of the family were present  to speak of what had been his hopes and his expectations you are all aware  he said  now  of the story of marmaduke bannerworth  and what an excessively troublesome person he was  with all deference  to you  henry  first of all  as to spending all his money at the gaming table  and leaving his family destitute  and then  when he did get a lump of money which might have done some good to those he left behind him hiding it somewhere where it could not be found at all  and so leaving you all in great difficulty and distress  when you might have been independent that s true enough  doctor  said henry  but you know the old proverb that ill gotten wealth never thrives  so that i don t regret not finding this money  for i am sure we should have been none the happier with it  and perhaps not so happy oh  bother the old proverb  thirty or forty thousand pounds is no trifle to be talked lightly of  or the loss of which to be quietly put up with  on account of a musty proverb  it s a large sum  and i should like to have placed it in your hands but as you cannot  doctor  there can be no good possibly done by regretting it no  certainly  i don t mean that  utter regret is always a very foolish thing  but it s questionable whether something might not be done in the matter  after all  for you  as it appears  by all the evidence we can collect  that it must have been varney  after all  who jumped down upon me from the garden wall in so sudden a manner  and  if the picture be valuable to him  it must be valuable to us but how are we to get it  and if we could  i do not see that it would be of much good to anybody  for  after all  it is but a painting there you go again  said the doctor  depreciating what you know nothing about  now  listen to me  master henry  and i will tell you that picture evidently had some sort of lining at the back  over the original canvas  and do you think i would have taken such pains to bring it away with me if that lining had not made me suspect that between it and the original picture the money  in bank notes  was deposited had you any special reason for supposing such was the case yes  most unquestionably i had  for when i got the picture fairly down i found various inequalities in the surface of the back  which led me to believe that rolls of notes were deposited  and that the great mistake we had all along made was in looking behind the picture  instead of at the picture itself  i meant immediately to have cut it to pieces when i reached here with it  but now it has got into the hands of somebody else  who knows  i suspect  as much i do it is rather provoking rather provoking  is that the way to talk of the loss of heaven knows how many thousands of pounds  i am quite aggravated myself at the idea of the thing  and it puts me in a perfect fever to think of it  i can assure you but what can we do oh  i propose an immediate crusade against varney  the vampyre  for who but he could have made such an attack upon me  and force me to deliver up such a valuable treasure never heed it  doctor  said flora  let it go  we have never had or enjoyed that money  so it cannot matter  and it is not to be considered as the loss of an actual possession  because we never did actually possess it yes  chimed in the admiral  bother the money  what do we care about it  and  besides  charley holland is going to be very busy busy  said the doctor  how do you mean why  isn t he going to be married directly to flora  here  and am not i going to settle the whole of my property upon him on condition that he takes the name of bell instead of holland  for  you see  his mother was my sister  and of course her name was bell  as for his father holland it can t matter to him now what charley is called  and if he don t take the name of bell i shall be the last in the family  for i am not likely to marry  and have any little bells about me no  said the doctor  i should say not  and that s the reason why you want to ring the changes upon charles holland s name  do you see the joke  admiral i can t say i do where is it  it s all very well to talk of jokes  but if i was like charles  going to be married  i shouldn t be in any joking humour  i can tell you  but quite the reverse  and as for you and your picture  if you want it  doctor  just run after varney yourself for it or  stay i have a better idea than that get your wife to go and ask him for it  and if she makes half such a clamour about his ears that she did about ours  he will give it her in a minute  to get rid of her my wife you don t mean to say she has been here yes  but she has though  and now  doctor  i can tell you i have seen a good deal of service in all parts of the world  and  of course  picked up a little experience  and  if i were you  some of these days  when mrs  chillingworth ain t very well  i d give her a composing draught that would make her quiet enough ah  that s not my style of practice  admiral  but i am sorry to hear that mrs  chillingworth has annoyed you so much pho  pho  man pho  pho  do you think she could annoy me  why  i have encountered storms and squalls in all latitudes  and it isn t a woman s tongue now that can do anything of an annoying character  i can tell you  far from it very far from it  so don t distress yourself upon that head  but come  doctor  we are going to have the wedding the day after to morrow no  no  said flora  the week after next  you mean is it the week after next  i ll be hanged if i didn t think it was the day after to morrow  but of course you know best  as you have settled it all among you  i have nothing to do with it of course  i shall  with great pleasure  returned the doctor  be present on the interesting occasion  but do you intend taking possession of bannerworth hall again no  certainly not  said henry  we propose going to the dearbrook estate  and there remaining for a time to see how we all like it  we may  perchance  enjoy it very much  for i have heard it spoken of as an attractive little property enough  and one that any one might fancy after being resident a short time upon it well  said the admiral  that is  i believe  settled among us  but i am sure we sha n t like it  on account of the want of the sea  why  i tell you  i have not seen a ship myself for this eighteen months there s a state of things  you see  that won t do to last  because one would get dry mouldy  it s a shocking thing to see nothing but land land  wherever you go from the preceding conversation may be gathered what were the designs of the bannerworth family  and what progress had been made in carrying them out  from the moment they had discovered the title deeds of the dearbrook property  they had ceased to care about the large sum of money which marmaduke bannerworth had been supposed to have hidden in some portion of bannerworth hall they had already passed through quite enough of the busy turmoils of existence to be grateful for anything that promised ease and competence and that serenity of mind which is the dearest possession which any one can compass consequently was it  that  with one accord  they got rid of all yearning after the large sum which the doctor was so anxious to procure for them and looked forward to a life of great happiness and contentment  on the whole  too  when they came to talk the matter over quietly among themselves  they were not sorry that varney had taken himself off in the way he had  for really it was a great release  and  as he had couched his farewell in words which signified it was a final one  they were inclined to think that he must have left england  and that it was not likely they should ever again encounter him  under any circumstances whatever it was to be considered quite as a whim of the old admiral s  the changing of charles holland s name to bell  but  as charles himself said when the subject was broached to him i am so well content to be called whatever those to whom i feel affection think proper  that i give up my name of holland without a pang  willingly adopting in its stead one that has always been hallowed in my remembrance with the best and kindest recollections and thus this affair was settled  much to the satisfaction of flora  who was quite as well content to be called mrs  bell as to be called mrs holland  since the object of her attachment remained the same  the wedding was really fixed for the week after that which followed the conversation we have recorded  but the admiral was not at all disposed to allow flora and his nephew charles to get through such an important period of their lives without some greater demonstration and show than could be made from the little cottage where they dwelt  and consequently he wished that they should leave that and proceed at once to a larger mansion  which he had his eye upon a few miles off  and which was to be had furnished for a time  at the pleasure of any one and we won t shut ourselves up  said the admiral  but we will find out all the christian like people in the neighbourhood  and invite them to the wedding  and we will have a jolly good breakfast together  and lots of music  and a famous lunch  and  after that  a dinner  and then a dance  and all that sort of thing  so that there shall be no want of fun as may be well supposed  both charles and flora shrunk from so public an affair  but  as the old man had evidently set his heart upon it  they did not like to say they positively would not  so  after a vain attempt to dissuade him from removing at all from the cottage until they removed for good  they gave up the point to him  and he had it all his own way he took the house  for one month  which had so taken his fancy  and certainly a pretty enough place it was  although they found out afterwards  that why it was he was so charmed with it consisted in the fact that it bore the name of a vessel which he had once commanded  but this they did not know until a long time afterwards  when it slipped out by mere accident they stipulated with the admiral that there should not be more than twenty guests at the breakfast which was to succeed the marriage ceremony  and to that he acceded  but henry whispered to charles holland i know this public wedding to be distasteful to you  and most particularly do i know it is distasteful to flora  so  if you do not mind playing a trick upon the old man  i can very easily put you in the way of cheating him entirely indeed  i should like to hear  and  what is more  i should like to practise  if you think it will not so entirely offend him as to make him implacable not at all  not at all  he will laugh himself  when he comes to know it  as much as any of us  the present difficulty will be to procure flora s connivance  but that we must do the best way we can by persuasion what this scheme was will ultimately appear  but  certain it is  that the old admiral had no suspicion of what was going on  and proceeded to make all his arrangements accordingly from his first arrival in the market town in the neighbourhood of which was bannerworth hall it will be recollected that he had taken a great fancy to the lawyer  in whose name a forged letter had been sent him informing him of the fact that his nephew  charles holland  intended marrying into a family of vampyres it was this letter  as the reader is aware  which brought the old admiral and jack pringle into the neighbourhood of the hall  and although it was a manoeuvre to get rid of charles holland  which failed most signally  there can be no doubt but that such a letter was the production of sir francis varney  and that he wrote it for the express purpose of getting rid of charles from the hall  who had begun materially to interfere with his plans and projects there after some conversation with himself  the admiral thought that this lawyer would be just the man to recommend the proper sort of people to be invited to the wedding of charles and flora  so he wrote to him inviting himself to dinner  and received back a very gracious reply from the lawyer  who declared that the honour of entertaining a gentleman whom he so much respected as admiral bell  was greater than he had a right to expect by a great deal  and that he should feel most grateful for his company  and await his coming with the greatest impatience a devilish civil fellow  that attorney  said the admiral  as he put the letter in his pocket  and almost enough to put one in conceit of lawyers yes  said jack pringle  who had overheard the admiral read the letter yes  we will honour him  and i only hope he will have plenty of grog because  you see  if he don t d n it  what s that  can t you keep things to yourself this latter exclamation arose from the fact that the admiral was so indignant at jack for listening to what he had been saying  as to throw a leaden inkstand  that happened to be upon the table  at his head you mutinous swab  he said  cannot a gentleman ask me to dinner  or cannot i ask myself  without you putting your spoke in the windlass  you vagabond oh  well  said jack  if you are out of temper about it  i had better send my mark to the lawyer  and tell him that we won t come  as it has made some family differences family  you thief  said the admiral  what do you mean  what family do you think would own you  d n me  if i don t think you came over in some strange ship  but  i tell you what it is  if you interfere in this matter  i ll be hanged if i don t blow your brains out and you ll be hanged if you do  said jack  as he walked out of the room  so it s all one either way  old fizgig what  roared the admiral  as he sprang up and ran after jack  have i lived all these years to be called names in my own ship i mean my own house  what does the infernal rascal mean by it the admiral  no doubt  would have pursued jack very closely  had not flora intercepted him  and  by gentle violence  got him back to the room  no one else could have ventured to have stopped him  but the affection he had for her was so great that she could really accomplish almost anything with him  and  by listening quietly to his complaints of jack pringle which  however  involved a disclosure of the fact which he had intended to keep to himself  that he had sought the lawyer s advice she succeeded in soothing him completely  so that he forgot his anger in a very short time but the old man s anger  although easily aroused  never lasted very long  and  upon the whole  it was really astonishing what he put up with from jack pringle  in the way of taunts and sneers  of all sorts and descriptions  and now and then not a little real abuse and  probably  he thought likewise that jack pringle did not mean what he said  on the same principle that he the admiral  when he called jack a mutinous swab and a marine  certainly did not mean that jack was those things  but merely used them as expletives to express a great amount of indignation at the moment  because  as may be well supposed nothing in the world could be worse  in admiral bell s estimation  that to be a mutinous swab or a marine it was rather a wonder  though  that  in his anger some day  he did not do jack some mischief  for  as we have had occasion to notice in one or two cases  the admiral was not extremely particular as to what sorts of missiles he used when he considered it necessary to throw something at jack s head it would not have been a surprising thing if jack had really made some communication to the lawyer  but he did stop short at that amount of pleasantry  and  as he himself expressed it  for once in a way he let the old man please himself the admiral soon forgot this little dispute  and then pleased himself with the idea that he should pass a pleasant day with the attorney ah  well  he said  who would have thought that ever i should have gone and taken dinner with a lawyer and not only done that  but invited myself too  it shows us all that there may be some good in all sorts of men  lawyers included  and i am sure  after this  i ought to begin to think what i never thought before  and that is  that a marine may actually be a useful person  it shows that  as one gets older  one gets wiser illustration it was an immense piece of liberality for a man brought up  as admiral bell had been  in decidedly one of the most prejudiced branches of the public service  to make any such admissions as these  a very great thing it was  and showed a liberality of mind such as  even at the present time  is not readily found it is astonishing  as well as amusing  to find how the mind assimilates itself to the circumstances in which it is placed  and how society being cut up into small sections  imagines different things merely as a consequence of their peculiar application  we shall find that even people  living at different ends of a city  will look with a sort of pity and contempt upon each other  and it is much to be regretted that public writers are found who use what little ability they may possess in pandering to their feelings it was as contemptible and silly as it was reprehensible for a late celebrated novelist to pretend that he believed there was at place called bloomsbury square  but he really did not know  because that was merely done for the purpose of raising a silly laugh among persons who were neither respectable on account of their abilities or their conduct but to return from this digression  the admiral  attired in his best suit  which always consisted of a blue coat  the exact colour of the navy uniform  an immense pale primrose coloured waistcoat  and white kerseymere continuations  went to the lawyer s as had been arranged if anything at all could flatter the old man s vanity successfully  it certainly would be the manner in which he was received at the lawyer s house  where everything was done that could give him satisfaction a very handsome repast was laid before him  and  when the cloth was removed  the admiral broached the subject upon which he wished to ask the advice of his professional friend  after telling him of the wedding that was to come off  he said now  i have bargained to invite twenty people  and  of course  as that is exclusive of any of the family  and as i don t know any people about this neighbourhood except yourself  i want you and your family to come to start with  and then i want you to find me out some more decent people to make up the party i feel highly flattered  said the attorney  that  in such a case as this  you should have come to me  and my only great fear is  that i should not be able to give you satisfaction oh  you needn t be afraid of that  there is no fear on that head  so i shall leave it all to you to invite the folks that you think proper i will endeavour  certainly  admiral  to do my best  of course  living in the town  as i have for many years  i know some very nice people as well as some very queer ones oh  we don t want any of the queer ones  but let those who are invited be frank  hearty  good tempered people  such as one will be glad to meet over and over again without any ceremony none of your simpering people who are afraid to laugh for fear of opening their mouths too wide  but who are so mighty genteel that they are afraid to enjoy anything for fear it should be vulgar i understand you  admiral  perfectly  and shall endeavour to obey your instructions to the very letter  but  if i should unfortunately invite anybody you don t like  you must excuse me for making such a mistake oh  of course of course  never mind that  and  if any disagreeable fellow comes  we will smother him in some way it would serve him right  for no one ought to make himself disagreeable  after being honoured with an invitation from you  but i will be most especially careful  and i hope that such a circumstance will not occur never mind  if it should  i ll tell you what i ll do  i ll set jack pringle upon him  and if he don t worry his life out it will be a strange thing to me oh  said the lawyer  i am glad you have mentioned him  for it gives me an opportunity of saying that i have done all in my power to make him comfortable all in your power to make him comfortable  what do you mean i mean that i have placed such a dinner before him as will please him i told him to ask for just whatever he likes the admiral looked at the lawyer with amazement  for a few moments  in silence  and then he said d n it  why  you don t mean to tell me  that that rascal is here oh  yes  he came about ten minutes i before you arrived  and said you were coming  and he has been down stairs feasting all the while since stop a bit  do you happen to have any loaded fire arms in the house we have got an old bunderbuss  but what for  admiral to shoot that scoundrel  pringle  i ll blow his brains out  as sure as fate  the impudence of his coming here  directly against my orders too my dear sir  calm yourself  and think nothing of it  it s of no consequence whatever no consequence  where is that blunderbuss of yours  do you mean to tell me that mutiny is of no consequence  give me the blunderbuss but  my clear sir  we only keep it in terrorem  and have no bullets never mind that  we can cram in a handful of nails  or brass buttons or hammer up a few halfpence anything of that sort will do to settle his business with how do you get on  old tarbarrel  said jack  putting his head in at the door  are you making yourself comfortable  i ll be hanged if i don t think you have a drop too much already  you look so precious red about the gills  i have been getting on famous  and i thought i d just hop up for a minute to make your mind easy about me  and tell you so it was quite evident that jack had done justice to the good cheer of the lawyer  for he was rather unsteady  and had to hold by the door post to support himself  while there was such a look of contentment upon his countenance as contrasted with the indignation that was manifest upon the admiral s face that  as the saying is  it would have made a cat laugh to see them be off with ye  jack  said the lawyer  be off with ye  go down stairs again and enjoy yourself  don t you see that the admiral is angry with you oh  he be bothered  said jack  i ll soon settle him if he comes any of his nonsense  and mind  mr  lawyer  whatever you do  don t you give him too much to drink the lawyer ran to the door  and pushed jack out  for he rightly enough suspected that the quietness of the admiral was only that calm which precedes a storm of more than usual amount and magnitude  so he was anxious to part them at once he then set about appeasing  as well as he could  the admiral s anger by attributing the perseverance of jack  in following him wherever he went  to his great affection for him  which  combined with his ignorance  might make him often troublesome when he had really no intention of being so this was certainly the best way of appeasing the old man  and  indeed the only way in which it could be done successfully  and the proof that it was so  consisted in the fact  that the admiral did consent  at the suggestion of the attorney  to forgive jack once more for the offence he had committed chapter xcvi the baron takes anderbury house  and decides upon giving a grand entertainment illustration it was not considered anything extraordinary that  although the baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh went out with the mysterious stranger who had arrived at the anderbury arms to see him  he should return without him for certainly he was not bound to bring him back  by any means whatever moreover  he entered the inn so quietly  and with such an appearance of perfect composure  that no one could have suspected for a moment that he had been guilty really of the terrific crime which had been laid to his charge a crime which few men could have committed in so entirely unmoved and passionless a manner as he had done it but he seemed to consider the taking of a human life as a thing not of the remotest consequence  and not to be considered at all as a matter which was to put any one out of the way  but as a thing to be done when necessity required  with all the ease in the world  without arousing or awaking any of those feelings of remorse which one would suppose ought to find a place in the heart of a man who had been guilty of such monstrous behaviour he walked up to his own apartment again  and retired to rest with the same feeling  apparently  of calmness  and the same ability to taste of the sweets of repose as had before characterized him the stranger s horse  which was a valuable and beautiful animal remained in the stable of the inn  and as  of course  that was considered a guarantee for his return  the landlord  when he himself retired to rest  left one of his establishment sitting up to let in the man who now lay so motionless and so frightful in appearance in one of the ice wells of the mysterious passage leading from the base of the cliff  to the grounds of anderbury house but the night wore on  and the man who had been left to let the stranger in  after making many efforts to keep himself awake  dropped into sound repose  which he might just as well have done in the first instance inasmuch as  although he knew it not  he was engaged in the vain task of waiting for the dead the morning was fresh and beautiful  and  at a far earlier hour than a person of his quality was expected to make his appearance  the baron descended from his chamber  for  somehow or other  by common consent  it seems to be agreed that great personages must be late in rising  and equally late in going to bed but the baron was evidently not so disposed to turn night into day  and the landlord congratulated himself not a little upon the fact that he was ready for his illustrious guest when he descended so unexpectedly from his chamber as he did an ample breakfast was disposed of  that is to say  it was placed upon the table  and charged to the baron  who selected from it what he pleased  and when the meal was over the landlord ventured to enter the apartment  and said to him  with all due humility if you please  sir  mr  leek  who has the letting of anderbury on the mount  that is  anderbury house  as it is usually called  is here  sir  and would be happy to take your orders as to when you would be pleased to look at those premises i shall be ready to go in half a hour  said the baron  and  as the distance is not great  i will walk from here to the mansion this message was duly communicated to mr  leek  who thereupon determined upon waiting until the baron should announce his readiness to depart upon the expedition  and he was as good as his word  for  in about half an hour afterwards  he descended to the hall  and then mr  leek was summoned  who came out of the bar with such a grand rush  that he fell over a mat that was before him  and saluted the baron by digging his head into his stomach  and then falling sprawling at his feet  and laying hold of his ankle this little incident was duly apologised for  and explained  after which mr  leek walked on through the town  towards anderbury on the mount followed by the illustrious personage whom he sincerely hoped he should be able to induce to take it it was a curious thing to see how they traversed the streets together for while the baron walked right on  and with a solemn and measured step  mr  leek managed to get along a few paces in front of him sideways  so that he could keep up a sort of conversation upon the merits of anderbury house  and the neighbourhood in general  without much effort  to which remarks the baron made such suitable and dignified replies as a baron would be supposed to make you will find  sir  said mr  leek  that everything about anderbury is extremely select  and amazingly correct  and i am sure a more delightful place to live in could not be found ah  said the baron  very likely it s lively  too  continued mr  leek  very lively  and there are two chapels of ease  besides the church that s a drawback  said the baron a drawback  sir  well  i am sorry i mentioned it  but perhaps you are a roman catholic  sir  and  in that case  the chapels of ease have no interest for you not the slightest  but do not  sir  run away with any assumption concerning my religious opinions  for i am not a roman catholic no  sir  no  sir  nor more am i  and  as far as i think  and my opinion goes  i say  why shouldn t a gentleman with a large fortune be what he likes  or nothing  if he likes that better  but here we are  sir  close to one of the entrances of anderbury house  there are three principal entrances  you understand  sir  on three sides of the estate  and the fourth side faces the sea  where there is that mysterious passage that leads down from the grounds to the beach  which  perhaps  you have heard of  sir the landlord of the inn mentioned it we consider it a great curiosity  sir  i can assure you  in these parts a very great curiosity  and it s an immense advantage to the house  because  you see  sir  in extremely hot weather  all sorts of provisions can be taken down there  and kept at such a very low temperature as to be quite delightful that is an advantage mr  leek rang the bell that hung over one of the entrances  and his summons for admission was speedily answered by the old couple who had charge of the premises  and then  with a view of impressing them with a notion of the importance of the personage whom he had brought to look at the place  he said  aloud the baron stoltmayor  of saltsomething  has come to look at the premises this announcement was received with all due deference and respect  and the task of showing the baron the premises at once fairly commenced here you have  said mr  leek  assuming an oratorical attitude here you have the umbrageous trees stooping down to dip their leaves in the purling waters  here you have the sweet foliage lending a delicious perfume to the balmy air  here you have the murmuring waterfalls playing music of the spheres to the listening birds  who sit responsive upon the dancing boughs  here you have all the fragrance of the briny ocean mingling with the scent of a bank of violets  and wrapping the senses in elysium  here you may never tire of an existence that presents never ending charms  and that  in the full enjoyment of which  you may live far beyond the allotted span of man enough enough  said the baron here you have the choicest exotics taking kindly to a soil gifted by nature with the most extraordinary powers of production  and all that can pamper the appetite or yield delight to the senses  is scattered around by nature with a liberal hand  it is quite impossible that royalty should come near the favoured spot without visiting it as a thing of course  and i forgot to mention that a revenue is derived from some cottages  which  although small  is yet sufficient to pay the tithe on the whole estate there  there that will do here you have purling rills and cascades  and fish ponds so redundant with the finny tribe  that you have but to wish for sport  and it is yours  here you have in the mansion  chambers that vie with the accommodation of a palace ample dormitories and halls of ancient grandeur  here you have stop  said the baron  stop  i cannot be pestered in this way with your description  i have no patience to listen to such mere words show me the house at once  and let me judge for myself certainly  sir  oh  certainly  only i thought it right to give you a slight description of the place as it really was  and now  sir  that we have reached the house  i may remark that here we have silence  said the baron  if you begin with here we have  i know not when you will leave off  all i require of you is to show me the place and to answer any question which i may put to you concerning it  i will draw my own conclusions  and nothing you can say  one way or another will affect my imagination certainly  sir  certainly  i shall only be too happy to answer any questions that may be put to me by a person of your lordship s great intelligence  and all i can remark is  that when you reach the drawing room floor  any person may truly say  here you have i really beg your pardon  sir i had not the slightest intention of saying here you have  i assure you  but the words came out quite unawares  i assure you peace peace  cried again the baron  you disturb me by this incessant clatter thus admonished  mr  leek was now quiet  and allowed the baron in his own way to make what investigation he pleased concerning anderbury house the investigation was not one that could be gone over in ten minutes for the house was extremely extensive  and the estate altogether presented so many features of beauty and interest  that it was impossible not to linger over it for a considerable period of time the grounds were most extensive  and planted with such a regard to order and regularity  everything being in its proper place  that it was a pleasure to see an estate so well kept  and although the baron was not a man who said much  it was quite evident  by what little he did utter that he was very well pleased with anderbury on the mount and now  said mr  leek  i will do myself the pleasure  sir  of showing your grace the subterranean passage at this moment a loud ring at one of the entrance gates was heard  and upon the man who had charge of the house answering the summons for admission  he found that it was a gentleman  who gave a card on which was the name of sir john westlake  and who desired to see the premises sir john westlake  said mr  leek  oh  i recollect he did call at my office  and say that he thought of taking anderbury on the mount  a gentleman of great and taste is sir john  but i must tell him  baron that you have the preference if you choose to embrace it at this moment the stranger advanced  and when he saw the baron  he bowed courteously  upon which mr  leek said i regret  sir john  that if you should take a fancy to the place  i am compelled first of all to give this gentleman the refusal of it certainly  said sir john westlake  do not let me interfere with any one  i have nearly made up my mind  and came to look over the property again  but of course  if this gentleman is beforehand with me  i must be content  i wish particularly to go down to the subterranean passage to the beach  if it is not too much trouble trouble  certainly not  sir  here  davis  get some links  and we can go at once  and as this gentleman likewise has seen everything but that strange excavation  he will probably descend with us certainly  said the baron  i shall have great pleasure  and he said it with so free and unembarrassed an air  that no one could have believed for a moment in the possibility that such a subject of fearful interest to him was there to be found the entrance from the grounds into this deep cavernous place was in a small but neat building  that looked like a summer house  and now torches being procured  and one lit  a door was opened  which conducted at once into the commencement of the excavation  and mr  leek heading the way  the distinguished party  as that gentleman loved afterwards to call it in his accounts of the transaction  proceeded into the very bowels of the earth  as it were  and quickly lost all traces of the daylight the place did not descend by steps  but by a gentle slope  which it required some caution to traverse  because  being cut in the chalk which in some places was worn very smooth  it was extremely slippery but this was a difficulty that a little practice soon overcame  and as they went on the place became more interesting every minute even the baron allowed mr  leek to make a speech upon the occasion  and that gentleman said you will perceive that this excavation must have been made  at a great expense  out of the solid cliff  and in making it some of the most curious specimens of petrifaction and fossil remains were found  you see that the roof is vaulted  and that it is only now and then a lump of chalk has fallen in  or a great piece of flint  and now we come to one of the ice wells they came to a deep excavation  down which they looked  and when the man held the torch beneath its surface  they could dimly see the bottom of it  where there was a number of large pieces of flint stone  and apparently  likewise  the remains of broken bottles there used to be a windlass at the top of this  said mr  leek  and the things were let down in a basket  they do say that ice will keep for two years in one of these places and are there more of these excavations  said the baron oh  dear  yes  sir  there are five or six of them for different purposes  for when the family that used to live in anderbury house had grand entertainments  which they sometimes had in the summer season they always had a lot of men down here  cooling wines  and passing them up from hand to hand to the house from the gradual slope of this passage down to the cliffs  and the zigzag character of it  it may be well supposed that it was of considerable extent  indeed  mr  leek asserted that it was half a mile in actual measured length the baron was not at all anxious to run any risk of a discovery of the dead body which he had cast into that ice well which was nearest to the opening on to the beach  so  as he went on  he negatived the different proposals that were made to look down into the excavations  and succeeded in putting a stop to that species of inquiry in the majority of instances  but he could not wholly do so perhaps it would have been better for his purpose if he had encouraged a look into every one of the ice wells  for  in that case  their similarity of appearance might have tired out sir john westlake before they got to the last one  but as it was  when they reached the one down which the body had been precipitated  he had the mortification to hear mr  leek say and now  sir john  and you  my lord baron  as we have looked at the first of these ice wells and at none of the others  suppose we look at the last the baron was afraid to say anything  because  if the body were discovered  and identified as that of the visitor at the inn  and who had been seen last with him  any reluctance on his part to have that ice well examined  might easily afterwards be construed into a very powerful piece of circumstantial evidence against him he therefore merely bowed his assent  thinking that the examination would be but a superficial one  and that  in consequence  he should escape easily from any disagreeable consequences but this the fates ordained otherwise  and there seemed no hope of that ice well in particular escaping such an investigation as was sure to induce some uncomfortable results davis  said mr  leek  these places are not deep  you see  and i was thinking that if you went down one of them  it would be as well  for then you would be able to tell the gentlemen what the bottom was fairly composed of  you understand oh  i don t mind  sir  said davis  i have been down one of them before to day  i can tell you  sir i do not see the necessity  said sir john westlake  exactly  of such a thing  but still if you please  and this gentleman wishes i have no wish upon the occasion  said the baron  and  like yourself cannot see the necessity oh  there is no trouble  said mr  leek  and it s better  now you are here  that you see and understand all about it  how can you get down davis why  sir  it ain t above fourteen feet altogether  so i sha n t have any difficulty  for i can hang by my hands about half the distance  and drop the remainder as he spoke he took off his coat  and then stuck the link he carried into a cleft of the rock  that was beside the brink of the excavation the baron now saw that there would be no such thing as avoiding a discovery of the fact of the dead body being in that place  and his only hope was  that in its descent it might have become so injured as to defy identification but this was a faint hope  because he recollected that he had himself seen the face  which was turned upwards  and the period after death was by far too short for him to have any hope that decomposition could have taken place even to the most limited extent the light  which was stuck in a niche  shed but a few inefficient rays down into the pit  and  as the baron stood  with folded arms  looking calmly on  he expected each moment a scene of surprise and terror would ensue nor was he wrong  for scarcely had the man plunged down into that deep place  than he uttered a cry of alarm and terror  and shouted murder  murder  lift me out  there is a dead man down here  and i have jumped upon him a dead man  cried mr  leek and sir john westlake in a breath how very strange  said the baron lend me a hand  cried davis  lend me a hand out  i cannot stand this you know  lend me a hand out  i say  at once this was easier to speak of than to do  and mr  davis began to discover that it was easier by far to get into a deep pit  than to get out of one  notwithstanding that his assertion of having been down into those places was perfectly true  but then he had met with nothing alarming and had been able perfectly at his leisure to scramble out the best way he could now  however  his frantic efforts to release himself from a much more uncomfortable situation than he had imagined it possible for him to get into  were of so frantic a nature  that he only half buried himself in pieces of chalk  which he kept pulling down with vehemence from the sides of the pit  and succeeded in accomplishing nothing towards his rescue oh  the fellow is only joking  said the baron  and amusing himself at our expense but the manner in which the man cried for help  and the marked terror which was in every tone  was quite sufficient to prove that he was not acting  for if he were  a more accomplished mimic could not have been found on the stage than he was this is serious  said sir john westlake  and cannot be allowed  have you any ropes here by which we can assist him from the pit  don t be alarmed  my man  for if there be a dead body in the pit  it can t harm you  take your time quietly and easily  and you will assuredly get out aye  said the baron  the more haste  the worst speed  is an english proverb  and in this case it will be fully exemplified  this man would easily leave the pit  if he would have the patience  with care and quietness  to clamber up its sides it would appear that davis felt the truth of these exhortations  for although he trembled excessively  he did begin to make some progress in his ascent  and get so high  that mr  leek was enabled to get hold of his hand  and give him a little assistance  so that  in another minute or so  he was rescued from his situation  which was not one of peril although it was certainly one of fright he trembled so excessively  and stuttered and stammered  that for some minutes no one could understand very well what he said  but at length upon making himself intelligible  he exclaimed there has been a murder  there has been a murder committed  and the body thrown into the ice pit  i felt that i jumped down upon something soft  and when i put down my hand to feel what it was  it came across a dead man s face  and then  of course  i called out you certainly did call out yes  and so would anybody  i think  under such circumstances  i suppose i shall be hung now  because i had charge of the house that did not strike me until this moment  said the baron  but if there be a dead body in that pit  it certainly places this man in a very awkward position what the deuce do you mean  said davis  i don t know no more about it than the child unborn  there is a dead man in the ice well  and that is all i know about it  but whether he has been there a long time  or a short time  i don t know any more than the moon  so it s no use bothering me about it my good man  said the baron  it would be very wrong indeed to impute to you any amount of criminality in this business  since you may be entirely innocent  and i  for one  believe that you are so  for i cannot think that any guilty man would venture into the place where he had put the body of his victim  in the way that you ventured into that pit  i say i cannot believe it possible  and therefore i think you innocent and will take care to see that no injustice is done you  but at the same time i cannot help adding  that i think  of course  you will find yourself suspected in some way i am very much obliged to you  sir  said davis  but as i happen to be quite innocent  i am very easy about it  and don t care one straw what people say  i have not been in this excavation for heaven knows how long but what s to be done  said mr  leek  i suppose it s our duty to do something  under such circumstances unquestionably  said the baron  and the first thing to be done  is to inform the police of what has happened  so that the body may be got up and as i have now seen enough of the estate to satisfy me as regards its capabilities  i decide at once upon taking it  if i can agree upon the conditions of the tenancy  and i will purchase it  if the price be such as i think suitable well  said mr  leek  if anything could reconcile me to the extraordinary circumstance that has just occurred  it certainly is baron  the having so desirable a tenant for anderbury on the mount as yourself  but we need not traverse all this passage again  for it is much nearer now to get out upon the sea coast at once  as we are so close to the other opening upon the beach  it seems to me that we ought to proceed at once to the town  and give information to the authorities of the discovery which we have made it is absolutely necessary  said the baron  so to do  so come along at once  i shall proceed to my inn  and as  of course  i have seen nothing more than yourselves  and consequently could only repeat your evidence  i do not see that my presence is called for  nevertheless  of course  if the justices think it absolutely necessary that i should appear  i can have no possible objection to so do this was as straightforward as anything that could be desired  and moreover  it was rather artfully put together  for it seemed to imply that he  mr  leek  would be slighted  if his evidence was not considered sufficient of course  said mr  leek  i don t see at all why  as you  sir  have only the same thing to say as myself  i should not be sufficient don t call upon me on any account  said sir john westlake oh  no  no  cried mr  leek  there is no occasion  i won t  you may depend  if it can be helped sir john  in rather a nervous and excited manner  bade them good day before they got quite into the town  and hurried off  while the baron with a dignified bow  when he reached the door of his hotel  said to mr leek of course i do not like the trouble of judicial investigations more than anybody else  and therefore  unless it is imperatively necessary that i should appear  i shall take it as a favour to be released from such a trouble my lord baron  said mr  leek  you may depend that i shall mention that to the magistrates and the coroner  and all those sort of people and then mr  leek walked away  but he muttered to himself  as he did so they will have him  as sure as fate  just because he is a baron  and his name will look well in the county chronicle mr  leek then repaired immediately to the house of one of the principal magistrates  and related what had occurred  to the great surprise of that gentleman  who suggested immediately the propriety of making the fact known to the coroner of the district  as it was more his business than a magistrate s  in the first instance  since nobody was accused of the offence this suggestion was immediately followed  and that functionary directed that the body should be removed from where it was to the nearest public house  and immediately issued his precept for an inquiry into the case by this time the matter had begun to get bruited about in the town  and of course it went from mouth to mouth with many exaggerations  and although it by no means did follow that a murder had been committed because a dead body had been found  yet  such was the universal impression  and the matter began to be talked about as the murder in the subterranean passage leading to anderbury house  with all the gusto which the full particulars of some deed of blood was calculated to inspire  and how it spread about was thus the fact was  that mr  leek was so anxious to let anderbury on the mount to the rich baron stolmuyer  of saltzburgh  that he got a friend of his to come and personate sir john westlake  while he  the baron  was looking at the premises  in order to drive him at once to a conclusion upon the matter  so that what made sir john so very anxious that he should not be called forward in the matter  consisted in the simple fact that he was nothing else than plain mr  brown  who kept a hatter s shop in the town  but he could not keep his own counsel  and  instead of holding his tongue  as he ought to have done  about the matter  he told it to every one he met  so that in a short time it was generally known that something serious and startling had occurred in the subterranean passage to anderbury house  and a great mob of persons thronged the beach in anxious expectation of getting more information on the matter the men  likewise  who had been ordered by the coroner to remove the body  soon reached the spot  and they gave an increased impetus to the proceedings  by opening the door of the subterranean passage  and then looking earnestly along the beach as if in expectation of something or somebody of importance when eagerly questioned by the mob  for the throng of persons now assembled quite amounted to a mob  to know what they waited for  one of them said a coffin was to have been brought down to take the body in this announcement at once removed anything doubtful that might be in the minds of any of them upon the subject  and at once proclaimed the fact not only that there was a dead body  but that if they looked out they would see it forthwith the throng thickened  and by the time two men were observed approaching with a coffin on their shoulders  there was scarcely anybody left in the town  except a few rare persons  indeed  who were not so curious as their neighbours it was not an agreeable job  even to those men who were not the most particular in the world  to be removing so loathsome a spectacle as that which they were pretty sure to encounter in the ice well  but they did not shrink from it  and  by setting about it as a duty  they got through it tolerably well they took with them several large torches  and then  one having descended into the pit  fastened a rope under the arms of the dead man and so he was hauled out  and placed in the shell that was ready to receive him they were all surprised at the fresh and almost healthful appearance of the countenance  and it was quite evident to everybody that if any one had known him in life  they could not have the least possible difficulty in recognising him now that he was no more and the only appearance of injury which he exhibited was in that dreadful wound which had certainly proved his death  and which was observable in his throat the moment they looked upon him illustration the crush to obtain a sight of the body was tremendous at the moment it was brought out  and a vast concourse of persons followed it in procession to the town  where the greatest excitement prevailed  it was easily discovered that no known person was missing  and some who had caught a sight of the body  went so far as to assert that it must have been in the ice well for years  and that the extreme cold had preserved it in all its original freshness the news  of course  came round  although not through the baron  for he did not condescend to say one word about it at the inn  and it was the landlord who first started the suggestion of what suppose it is the gentleman who left his horse here this idea had no sooner got possession of his brain  than it each moment seemed to him to assume a more reasonable and tangible form  and without saying any more to any one else about it  he at once started off to where the body lay awaiting an inquest  to see if his suspicions were correct when he arrived at the public house and asked to see the body  he was at once permitted to do so  for the landlord knew him  and was as curious as he could be upon the subject by any possibility  one glance  of course  was sufficient  and the landlord at once said yes  i have seen him before  though i don t know his name  he came to my house last night  and left his horse there  and  although i only saw him for a moment as he passed through the hall  i am certain i am not mistaken  i dare say all my waiters will recognise him  as well as the baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh  who is staying with me  and who no doubt knows very well who he is  for he went out with him late and came home alone  and i ordered one of my men to wait up all night in order to let in this very person who is now lying dead before us the deuce you did  but you don t suppose the baron murdered him  do you it s a mystery to me altogether quite a profound mystery  it s very unlikely  certainly  and what s the most extraordinary part of the whole affair is  how the deuce could he come into one of the ice wells belonging to anderbury house  that s what puzzles me altogether well  it will all come out  i hope  at the inquest  which is to be held at four o clock to day  there must have been foul play somewhere  but the mystery is where  and that heaven only knows  perhaps i shall attend  said the landlord  of course  to identify him  and i suppose  unless anybody claims the horse  i may as well keep possession of it don t you flatter yourself that you will get the horse out of the transaction  don t you know quite well that the government takes possession of everything as don t belong to nobody yes  but i have got him  and possession  you know  is nine points of the law it may be so  but their tenth point will get the better of you for all that  you take my word for it  the horse will be claimed of you  but i don t mind  as an old acquaintance  putting you up to a dodge in what way why  i ll tell you what happened with a friend of mine  but don t think it was me for if it was i would tell you at once  so don t think it  he kept a country public house  and  one day  an elderly gentleman came in and appeared to be unwell  he just uttered a word or two  and then dropped down dead  he happened to have in his fob a gold repeater  that was worth  at least a hundred guineas  and my friend  before anybody came  took it out  and popped in  in its stead  an old watch that he had  which was not worth a couple of pounds it was running a risk it was  but it turned out very well  because the old gentleman happened to be a very eccentric person  and was living alone  so that his friends really did not know what he had  or what he had not  but took it for granted that any watch produced belonged to him  so  if i were you in this case  when the gentleman s horse is claimed  i d get the d dest old screw i could  and let them have that you would indeed would i  and glory in it  too  as the very best thing that could be done  now  a horse is of use to you i believe ye  it is exactly  but what s the use of it to government  and  what s more  if it went to the government  there might be some excuse  but the government will know no more about it  and make not so much as i shall some jack in office will lay hold of it as a thing of course and a perquisite  when you might just as well  and a great deal better  too keep it yourself  for it would do you some good  as you say  and none to them i ll do it  it is a good and a happy thought  there is no reason on earth why i shouldn t do it  and i will  i have made up my mind to it now well  i am glad you have  what do you think now the dead man s horse is worth oh  fifty or sixty guineas value then very good  then  when the affair is all settled  i will trouble you for twenty pounds you yes  to be sure  who else do you suppose is going to interfere with you  one is enough  ain t it  at a time  and i think  after giving you such advice as i have  that i am entitled  at all events  to something i tell you what  said the landlord of the hotel  taking all things into consideration  i have altered my mind rather  and won t do it very good  you need not  only mind  if you do  i am down upon you like a shot the excitement contingent upon the inquest was very great  indeed  the large room in the public house  where it was held  was crowded to suffocation with persons who were anxious to be present at the proceedings  when the landlord reached home  of course he told his guest  the baron  of the discovery he had made  that the murdered man was the strange visitor of the previous night  for now  from the frightful wound he had received in his throat  the belief that he was murdered became too rational a one to admit of any doubts  and was that which was universally adopted in preference to any other suggestion upon the occasion  although  no doubt  people would be found who would not scruple to aver that he had cut his own throat  after making his way into the well belonging to anderbury house the landlord had his own misgivings concerning his guest  the baron  now that something had occurred of such an awful and mysterious a nature to one who was evidently known to him  it did not seem to be a pleasant thing to have such an intimate friend of a man who had been murdered in one s house  especially when it came to be considered that he was the last person seen in his company  and that  consequently  he was peculiarly called upon to give an explanation of how  and under what circumstances  he had parted with him the baron was sitting smoking in the most unconcerned manner in the world  when the landlord came to bring him this intelligence  and  when he had heard him to an end  the remark he made was really  you very much surprise me  but  perhaps  as you are better acquainted with the town than i am  you can tell me who he was why  sir  that is what we hoped you would be able to tell us how should i tell you  he introduced himself to me as a mr  mitchell  a surveyor  and he said that  hearing i talked of purchasing or renting anderbury on the mount  he came to tell me that the principal side wall that you could see from the beach  was off the perpendicular indeed  sir yes  and as this was a very interesting circumstance to me  considering that i really did contemplate such a purchase or renting  and do so still  as it was a moonlight night  and he said he could show me in a minute what he meant if i would accompany him  i did so  but when we got there  and on the road  i heard quite enough of him to convince me that he was a little out of his senses  and  consequently  i paid no more attention to what he said  but walked home and left him on the beach it s a most extraordinary circumstance  sir  there is no such person  i assure you  as mitchell  a surveyor  in the town  so i can t make it out in the least but  i tell you  i consider the man out of his senses  and perhaps that may account for the whole affair oh  yes  sir  that would  certainly  but still  it s a very odd thing because we don t know of such a person at all  and it does seem so extraordinary that he should have made his appearance  all of a sudden in this sort of way  i suppose  sir  that you will attend the inquest now  that s to be held upon him oh  yes  i have no objection whatever to that  indeed  i feel myself bound to do so  because i suppose mine is the latest evidence that can be at all produced concerning him unquestionably  sir  our coroner is a very clever man  and you will be glad to know him very glad to know him  sir  and he will be glad to know you  so i am sure it will be a mutual gratification  it s at four o clock the inquest is to be  and i dare say  sir  if you are there by half past  it will be time enough no doubt of that  but i will be punctual we have already said the room in which the inquest was to be held was crowded almost to suffocation  and not only was that the case  but the lower part of the house was crammed with people likewise  and there can be very little doubt but the baron would have shrunk from such an investigation from a number of curious eyes  if he could have done so while the landlord of the house would have had no objection  as far as his profit was concerned in the sale of a great quantity of beer and spirits  to have had such an occurrence every day in the week  if possible the body lay still in the shell where it had been originally placed after it had been viewed by the jury  and almost every one had remarked upon the extraordinary fresh appearance it wore  they proceeded at once to the inquiry  and the first witness who appeared was mr  leek  who deposed to have been in company with some gentlemen viewing anderbury house  and to have found the body in one of the ice wells of that establishment this evidence was corroborated by that of davis  who had so unexpectedly jumped into the well  without being aware that it contained already so disagreeable a visitor as it did in the person of the murdered man regarding the cause of whose death the present inquiry was instituted then the landlord identified the body as that of a gentleman who had come to his house on horseback  and who had afterwards walked out with baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh  who was one of his guests is that gentleman in attendance  said the coroner yes  sir  he is  i told him about it  and he has kindly come forward to give all the evidence in his power concerning it there was a general expression of interest and curiosity when the baron stepped forward  attired in his magnificent coat  trimmed with fur  and tendered his evidence to the coroner  which  of course  was precisely the same as the statement he had made to the landlord of the house  for as he had made up such a well connected story  he was not likely to prevaricate or to depart from it in the smallest particular he was listened to with breathless attention  and  when he had concluded  the coroner  with a preparatory hem  said to him and you have reason to suppose  sir  that this person was out of his senses it seemed to me so  he talked wildly and incoherently  and in such a manner as to fully induce such a belief you left him on the beach i did  i found when i got there that it was only a very small portion indeed  of anderbury house that was visible  and  although the moon shone brightly  i must confess i did not see  myself  any signs of deviation from the perpendicular  and  such being the case  i left the spot at once  because i could have no further motive in staying  and moreover  it was not pleasant to be out at night with a man whom i thought was deranged  i regretted  after making this discovery  that i had come from home on such a fool s errand  but as  when one is going to invest a considerable sum of money in any enterprise  one is naturally anxious to know all about it  i went  little suspecting that the man was insane did you see him after that certainly not  until to day  when i recognised in the body that has been exhibited to me the same individual gentlemen  said the coroner to the jury  it appears to me that this is a most mysterious affair  the deceased person has a wound in his throat  which  i have no doubt  you will hear from a medical witness has been the cause of death  and the most singular part of the affair is how  if he inflicted it upon himself  he has managed to dispose of the weapon with which he did the deed the last person seen in his company  said one of the jury  was the baron  and i think he is bound to give some better explanation of the affair i am yet to discover  said the baron  that the last person who acknowledges to having been in the company of a man afterwards murdered must  of necessity  be the murderer yes  but how do you account  sir  for there being no weapon found by which the man could have done the deed himself i don t account for it at all how do you this is irregular  said the coroner  call the next witness this was a medical man  who briefly stated that he had seen the deceased  and that the wound in his throat was amply sufficient to account for his death  that it was inflicted with a sharp instrument having an edge on each side this  then  seemed to conclude the case  and the coroner remarked gentlemen of the jury i think this is one of those peculiar cases in which an open verdict is necessary  or else an adjournment without date so that the matter can be resumed at any time  if fresh evidence can be procured concerning it  there is no one accused of the offence  although it appears to me impossible that the unhappy man could have committed the act himself  we have no reason to throw the least shade of suspicion or doubt upon the evidence of the baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh  for as far as we know anything of the matter  the murdered man may have been in the company of a dozen people after the baron left him a desultory conversation ensued  which ended in an adjournment of the inquest  without any future day being mentioned for its re assembling and so the baron stolmuyer entirely escaped from what might have been a very serious affair to him it did not  however  appear to shake him in his resolution of taking anderbury on the mount  although mr  leek very much feared it would  but he announced to that gentleman his intention fully of doing so  and told him to get the necessary papers drawn up forthwith i hope  he said  within a few weeks  time to be fairly installed in that mansion  and then i will trouble you  mr  leek  to give me a list of the names of all the best families in the neighbourhood  for i intend giving an entertainment on a grand scale in the mansion and grounds sir  said mr  leek  i shall  with the greatest pleasure  attend upon you in every possible way in this affair  this is a very excellent neighbourhood  and you will have no difficulty  i assure you  sir  in getting together an extremely capital and creditable assemblage of persons  there could not be a better plan devised for at once introducing all the people who are worth knowing  to you i thank you  said the baron  i think the place will suit me well and  as the baroness stolmuyer of saltzburgh is dead  i have some idea of marrying again  and therefore it becomes necessary and desirable that i should be well acquainted with the surrounding families of distinction in this neighbourhood this was a hint not at all likely to be thrown away upon mr  leek  who was the grand gossip monger of the place  and he treasured it up in order to see if he could not make something of it which would be advantageous to himself he knew quite enough of the select and fashionable families in that neighbourhood  to be fully aware that neither the baron s age nor his ugliness would be any bar to his forming a matrimonial alliance there is not one of them  he said to himself  who would not marry the very devil himself and be called the countess lucifer  or any name of the kind  always provided there was plenty of money  and that the baron has without doubt  so it is equally without doubt he may pick and choose where he pleases this was quite correct of mr  leek  and showed his great knowledge of human nature  and we entertain with him a candid opinion  that if the baron stolmuyer of saltzburgh had been ten times as ugly as he was  and heaven knows that was needless  he might pick and choose a wife almost when he pleased this is a general rule  and as  of course  to all general rules there are exceptions  this one cannot be supposed to be free from them  under all circumstances  and in all classes of society  there are single minded beings who consult the pure dictates of their own hearts and who  disdaining those things which make up the amount of the ambition of meaner spirits  stand aloof as bright and memorable examples to the rest of human nature such a being was flora bannerworth  she would never have been found to sacrifice herself to the fancied advantages of wealth and station  but would have given her heart and hand to the true object of her affection although a sovereign prince had made the endeavour to wean her from it end of project gutenberg s varney the vampire  by thomas preskett prest  end of this project gutenberg ebook varney the

chapter x chapter xi chapter xii book one  chapter i well  prince  so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes  but i warn you  if you don t tell me that this means war if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that antichrist i really believe he is antichrist i will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend  no longer my faithful slave  as you call yourself  but how do you do  i see i have frightened you sit down and tell me all the news it was in july   and the speaker was the well known anna pavlovna scherer  maid of honor and favorite of the empress marya fedorovna  with these words she greeted prince vasili kuragin  a man of high rank and importance  who was the first to arrive at her reception  anna pavlovna had had a cough for some days  she was  as she said  suffering from la grippe  grippe being then a new word in st  petersburg  used only by the elite all her invitations without exception  written in french  and delivered by a scarlet liveried footman that morning  ran as follows if you have nothing better to do  count or prince  and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between  and annette scherer heavens  what a virulent attack  replied the prince  not in the least disconcerted by this reception  he had just entered  wearing an embroidered court uniform  knee breeches  and shoes  and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face  he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought  and with the gentle  patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court  he went up to anna pavlovna kissed her hand  presenting to her his bald  scented  and shining head and complacently seated himself on the sofa first of all  dear friend  tell me how you are  set your friend s mind at rest  said he without altering his tone  beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned can one be well while suffering morally  can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling  said anna pavlovna  you are staying the whole evening  i hope and the fete at the english ambassador s  today is wednesday  i must put in an appearance there  said the prince  my daughter is coming for me to take me there i thought today s fete had been canceled  i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome if they had known that you wished it  the entertainment would have been put off  said the prince  who  like a wound up clock  by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed don t tease  well  and what has been decided about novosiltsev s dispatch  you know everything what can one say about it  replied the prince in a cold  listless tone  what has been decided  they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats  and i believe that we are ready to burn ours prince vasili always spoke languidly  like an actor repeating a stale part  anna pavlovna scherer on the contrary  despite her forty years overflowed with animation and impulsiveness  to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and  sometimes even when she did not feel like it  she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her  the subdued smile which  though it did not suit her faded features  always played round her lips expressed as in a spoiled child  a continual consciousness of her charming defect which she neither wished  nor could  nor considered it necessary  to correct in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pavlovna burst out oh  don t speak to me of austria  perhaps i don t understand things but austria never has wished  and does not wish  for war  she is betraying us  russia alone must save europe  our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it  that is the one thing i have faith in  our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth  and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him  he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution  which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain  we alone must avenge the blood of the just one  whom  i ask you  can we rely on  england with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the emperor alexander s loftiness of soul  she has refused to evacuate malta  she wanted to find  and still seeks  some secret motive in our actions  what answer did novosiltsev get  none  the english have not understood and cannot understand the self abnegation of our emperor who wants nothing for himself  but only desires the good of mankind  and what have they promised  nothing  and what little they have promised they will not perform  prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible  and that all europe is powerless before him  and i don t believe a word that hardenburg says  or haugwitz either  this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap  i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch  he will save europe she suddenly paused  smiling at her own impetuosity i think  said the prince with a smile  that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussia s consent by assault  you are so eloquent  will you give me a cup of tea in a moment  a propos  she added  becoming calm again  i am expecting two very interesting men tonight  le vicomte de mortemart  who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans  one of the best french families  he is one of the genuine emigres  the good ones  and also the abbe morio  do you know that profound thinker  he has been received by the emperor  had you heard i shall be delighted to meet them  said the prince  but tell me  he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit  is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna  the baron by all accounts is a poor creature prince vasili wished to obtain this post for his son  but others were trying through the dowager empress marya fedorovna to secure it for the baron anna pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister was all she said  in a dry and mournful tone as she named the empress  anna pavlovna s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness  and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness  she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup d estime  and again her face clouded over with sadness the prince was silent and looked indifferent  but  with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her  anna pavlovna wished both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the empress  and at the same time to console him  so she said now about your family  do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her  they say she is amazingly beautiful the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude i often think  she continued after a short pause  drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed  why has fate given you two such splendid children  i don t speak of anatole  your youngest  i don t like him  she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows  two such charming children  and really you appreciate them less than anyone  and so you don t deserve to have them and she smiled her ecstatic smile i can t help it  said the prince  lavater would have said i lack the bump of paternity don t joke  i mean to have a serious talk with you  do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son  between ourselves  and her face assumed its melancholy expression  he was mentioned at her majesty s and you were pitied the prince answered nothing  but she looked at him significantly awaiting a reply  he frowned what would you have me do  he said at last  you know i did all a father could for their education  and they have both turned out fools hippolyte is at least a quiet fool  but anatole is an active one  that is the only difference between them  he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual  so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant and why are children born to such men as you  if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with  said anna pavlovna looking up pensively i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life  it is the cross i have to bear  that is how i explain it to myself  it can t be helped he said no more  but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture  anna pavlovna meditated have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole  she asked  they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking  and though i don t feel that weakness in myself as yet  i know a little person who is very unhappy with her father  she is a relation of yours  princess mary bolkonskaya prince vasili did not reply  though  with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world  he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information do you know  he said at last  evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts  that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year  and  he went on after a pause  what will it be in five years  if he goes on like this  presently he added  that s what we fathers have to put up with  is this princess of yours rich her father is very rich and stingy  he lives in the country  he is the well known prince bolkonski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor  and was nicknamed the king of prussia  he is very clever but eccentric  and a bore  the poor girl is very unhappy  she has a brother  i think you know him  he married lise meinen lately  he is an aide de camp of kutuzov s and will be here tonight listen  dear annette  said the prince  suddenly taking anna pavlovna s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards  arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted slave slafe with an f  as a village elder of mine writes in his reports  she is rich and of good family and that s all i want and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him  he raised the maid of honor s hand to his lips  kissed it  and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair  looking in another direction attendez  said anna pavlovna  reflecting  i ll speak to lise  young bolkonski s wife  this very evening  and perhaps the thing can be arranged  it shall be on your family s behalf that i ll start my apprenticeship as old maid chapter ii anna pavlovna s drawing room was gradually filling  the highest petersburg society was assembled there  people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged prince vasili s daughter  the beautiful helene  came to take her father to the ambassador s entertainment  she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor  the youthful little princess bolkonskaya  known as la femme la plus seduisante de petersbourg   was also there  she had been married during the previous winter  and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings  but only to small receptions  prince vasili s son hippolyte  had come with mortemart  whom he introduced  the abbe morio and many others had also come  the most fascinating woman in petersburg to each new arrival anna pavlovna said  you have not yet seen my aunt or you do not know my aunt  and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady  wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap  who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive  and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt  anna pavlovna mentioned each one s name and then left them each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew  not one of them wanted to know  and not one of them cared about  anna pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval  the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words  about their health and her own  and the health of her majesty  who  thank god  was better today  and each visitor  though politeness prevented his showing impatience  left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening the young princess bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold embroidered velvet bag  her pretty little upper lip  on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible  was too short for her teeth  but it lifted all the more sweetly  and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip  as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman  her defect the shortness of her upper lip and her half open mouth seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty  everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman  so soon to become a mother  so full of life and health  and carrying her burden so lightly  old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her  after being in her company and talking to her a little while  felt as if they too were becoming  like her  full of life and health  all who talked to her  and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth  thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day the little princess went round the table with quick  short  swaying steps  her workbag on her arm  and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar  as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her  i have brought my work said she in french  displaying her bag and addressing all present mind  annette  i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me  she added  turning to her hostess  you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception  and just see how badly i am dressed  and she spread out her arms to show her short waisted  lace trimmed  dainty gray dress girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast soyez tranquille  lise  you will always be prettier than anyone else replied anna pavlovna you know  said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french  turning to a general  my husband is deserting me  he is going to get himself killed  tell me what this wretched war is for  she added  addressing prince vasili  and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter  the beautiful helene what a delightful woman this little princess is  said prince vasili to anna pavlovna one of the next arrivals was a stout  heavily built young man with close cropped hair  spectacles  the light colored breeches fashionable at that time  a very high ruffle  and a brown dress coat  this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezukhov  a well known grandee of catherine s time who now lay dying in moscow  the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service  as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated  and this was his first appearance in society  anna pavlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room  but in spite of this lowest grade greeting  a look of anxiety and fear  as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place  came over her face when she saw pierre enter  though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room  her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy  but observant and natural  expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room it is very good of you  monsieur pierre  to come and visit a poor invalid  said anna pavlovna  exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her pierre murmured something unintelligible  and continued to look round as if in search of something  on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile  as to an intimate acquaintance anna pavlovna s alarm was justified  for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty s health  anna pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words  do you know the abbe morio  he is a most interesting man yes  i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace  and it is very interesting but hardly feasible you think so  rejoined anna pavlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess  but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness  first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him  and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away  with his head bent  and his big feet spread apart he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbe s plan chimerical we will talk of it later  said anna pavlovna with a smile and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave  she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch  ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag  as the foreman of a spinning mill  when he has set the hands to work  goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should  and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion  so anna pavlovna moved about her drawing room  approaching now a silent  now a too noisy group  and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady proper  and regular motion  but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident  she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there  and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbe pierre had been educated abroad  and this reception at anna pavlovna s was the first he had attended in russia  he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and  like a child in a toyshop  did not know which way to look  afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard  seeing the self confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound  at last he came up to morio  here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views  as young people are fond of doing chapter iii anna pavlovna s reception was in full swing  the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides  with the exception of the aunt beside whom sat only one elderly lady  who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society  the whole company had settled into three groups  one  chiefly masculine  had formed round the abbe  another  of young people  was grouped round the beautiful princess helene  prince vasili s daughter  and the little princess bolkonskaya very pretty and rosy  though rather too plump for her age  the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pavlovna the vicomte was a nice looking young man with soft features and polished manners  who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself  anna pavlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests  as a clever maitre d hotel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat  so anna pavlovna served up to her guests  first the vicomte and then the abbe  as peculiarly choice morsels  the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc d enghien  the vicomte said that the duc d enghien had perished by his own magnanimity  and that there were particular reasons for buonaparte s hatred of him ah  yes  do tell us all about it  vicomte  said anna pavlovna  with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la louis xv in the sound of that sentence  contez nous cela  vicomte the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply  anna pavlovna arranged a group round him  inviting everyone to listen to his tale the vicomte knew the duc personally  whispered anna pavlovna to one of the guests  the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur  said she to another how evidently he belongs to the best society  said she to a third  and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style  like a well garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile come over here  helene  dear  said anna pavlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off  the center of another group the princess smiled  she rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman  with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy  with a gleam of white shoulders  glossy hair  and sparkling diamonds  she passed between the men who made way for her  not looking at any of them but smiling on all  as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders  back and bosom which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pavlovna  helene was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry  but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty  she seemed to wish but to be unable  to diminish its effect how lovely  said everyone who saw her  and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile madame  i doubt my ability before such an audience  said he  smilingly inclining his head the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary  she smilingly waited  all the time the story was being told she sat upright  glancing now at her beautiful round arm altered in shape by its pressure on the table  now at her still more beautiful bosom  on which she readjusted a diamond necklace  from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress  and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pavlovna  at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor s face  and again relapsed into her radiant smile the little princess had also left the tea table and followed helene wait a moment  i ll get my work  now then  what are you thinking of  she went on  turning to prince hippolyte  fetch me my workbag there was a general movement as the princess  smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once  sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat now i am all right  she said  and asking the vicomte to begin  she took up her work prince hippolyte  having brought the workbag  joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister  but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly  his features were like his sister s  but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous  self satisfied  youthful  and constant smile of animation  and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure  his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self confidence  while his body was thin and weak  his eyes  nose  and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant  wearied grimace  and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions it s not going to be a ghost story  said he  sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette  as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak why no  my dear fellow  said the astonished narrator  shrugging his shoulders because i hate ghost stories  said prince hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them he spoke with such self confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid  he was dressed in a dark green dress coat  knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayee  as he called it  shoes  and silk stockings the vicomte told his tale very neatly  it was an anecdote  then current to the effect that the duc d enghien had gone secretly to paris to visit mademoiselle george  that at her house he came upon bonaparte  who also enjoyed the famous actress  favors  and that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject and was thus at the duc s mercy  the latter spared him  and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death the story was very pretty and interesting  especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another  and the ladies looked agitated charming  said anna pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess charming  whispered the little princess  sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue  but just then anna pavlovna  who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her  noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe  so she hurried to the rescue  pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe about the balance of power  and the latter  evidently interested by the young man s simple minded eagerness  was explaining his pet theory  both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally  which was why anna pavlovna disapproved the means are  the balance of power in europe and the rights of the people  the abbe was saying  it is only necessary for one powerful nation like russia barbaric as she is said to be to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe  and it would save the world but how are you to get that balance  pierre was beginning at that moment anna pavlovna came up and  looking severely at pierre asked the italian how he stood russian climate  the italian s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected  sugary expression  evidently habitual to him when conversing with women i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society  more especially of the feminine society  in which i have had the honor of being received  that i have not yet had time to think of the climate  said he not letting the abbe and pierre escape  anna pavlovna  the more conveniently to keep them under observation  brought them into the larger circle chapter iv just then another visitor entered the drawing room  prince andrew bolkonski  the little princess  husband  he was a very handsome young man  of medium height  with firm  clearcut features  everything about him  from his weary  bored expression to his quiet  measured step offered a most striking contrast to his quiet  little wife  it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room  but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them  and among all these faces that he found so tedious  none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife  he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face  kissed anna pavlovna s hand  and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company you are off to the war  prince  said anna pavlovna general kutuzov  said bolkonski  speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the general s name like a frenchman  has been pleased to take me as an aide de camp and lise  your wife she will go to the country are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife andre  said his wife  addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men  the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away  pierre  who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad affectionate eyes  now came up and took his arm  before he looked round prince andrew frowned again  expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm  but when he saw pierre s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile there now  so you  too  are in the great world  said he to pierre i knew you would be here  replied pierre  i will come to supper with you  may i  he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story no  impossible  said prince andrew  laughing and pressing pierre s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question  he wished to say something more  but at that moment prince vasili and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass you must excuse me  dear vicomte  said prince vasili to the frenchman holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising this unfortunate fete at the ambassador s deprives me of a pleasure and obliges me to interrupt you  i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party  said he  turning to anna pavlovna his daughter  princess helene  passed between the chairs  lightly holding up the folds of her dress  and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face  pierre gazed at her with rapturous almost frightened  eyes as she passed him very lovely  said prince andrew very  said pierre in passing prince vasili seized pierre s hand and said to anna pavlovna educate this bear for me  he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society  nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women anna pavlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand  she knew his father to be a connection of prince vasili s  the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasili in the anteroom  all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear how about my son boris  prince  said she  hurrying after him into the anteroom  i can t remain any longer in petersburg  tell me what news i may take back to my poor boy although prince vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady  even betraying some impatience  she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile  and took his hand that he might not go away what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor  and then he would be transferred to the guards at once  said she believe me  princess  i am ready to do all i can  answered prince vasili  but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor  i should advise you to appeal to rumyantsev through prince golitsyn  that would be the best way the elderly lady was a princess drubetskaya  belonging to one of the best families in russia  but she was poor  and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections  she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son  it was  in fact  solely to meet prince vasili that she had obtained an invitation to anna pavlovna s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte s story  prince vasili s words frightened her  an embittered look clouded her once handsome face  but only for a moment  then she smiled again and clutched prince vasili s arm more tightly listen to me  prince  said she  i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again  nor have i ever reminded you of my father s friendship for you  but now i entreat you for god s sake to do this for my son and i shall always regard you as a benefactor  she added hurriedly  no  don t be angry  but promise  i have asked golitsyn and he has refused  be the kindhearted man you always were  she said trying to smile though tears were in her eyes papa  we shall be late  said princess helene  turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door influence in society  however  is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last  prince vasili knew this  and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him  he would soon be unable to ask for himself  he became chary of using his influence  but in princess drubetskaya s case he felt  after her second appeal  something like qualms of conscience  she had reminded him of what was quite true he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career moreover  he could see by her manners that she was one of those women mostly mothers who  having once made up their minds  will not rest until they have gained their end  and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour  and even to make scenes this last consideration moved him my dear anna mikhaylovna  said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone  it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father s memory i will do the impossible your son shall be transferred to the guards here is my hand on it  are you satisfied my dear benefactor  this is what i expected from you i knew your kindness  he turned to go wait just a word  when he has been transferred to the guards  she faltered  you are on good terms with michael ilarionovich kutuzov recommend boris to him as adjutant  then i shall be at rest  and then prince vasili smiled no  i won t promise that  you don t know how kutuzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief  he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants no  but do promise  i won t let you go  my dear benefactor papa  said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before  we shall be late well  au revoir  good bye  you hear her then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor certainly  but about kutuzov  i don t promise do promise  do promise  vasili  cried anna mikhaylovna as he went with the smile of a coquettish girl  which at one time probably came naturally to her  but was now very ill suited to her careworn face apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts  but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold  artificial expression  she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking  and again pretended to listen  while waiting till it would be time to leave  her task was accomplished chapter v and what do you think of this latest comedy  the coronation at milan asked anna pavlovna  and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte  and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations  adorable  it is enough to make one s head whirl  it is as if the whole world had gone crazy prince andrew looked anna pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile dieu me la donne  gare a qui la touche   they say he was very fine when he said that  he remarked  repeating the words in italian  dio mi l ha dato  guai a chi la tocchi  god has given it to me  let him who touches it beware i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over  anna pavlovna continued  the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything the sovereigns  i do not speak of russia  said the vicomte  polite but hopeless  the sovereigns  madame  what have they done for louis xvii for the queen  or for madame elizabeth  nothing  and he became more animated  and believe me  they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause  the sovereigns  why  they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper and sighing disdainfully  he again changed his position prince hippolyte  who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette  suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess  and having asked for a needle began tracing the conde coat of arms on the table  he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it baton de gueules  engrele de gueules d azur maison conde  said he the princess listened  smiling if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer  the vicomte continued  with the air of a man who  in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else  does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts  things will have gone too far by intrigues  violence  exile  and executions  french society i mean good french society will have been forever destroyed  and then he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands  pierre wished to make a remark  for the conversation interested him  but anna pavlovna who had him under observation  interrupted the emperor alexander  said she  with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family  has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government  and i believe that once free from the usurper the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king  she concluded  trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant that is doubtful  said prince andrew  monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far  i think it will be difficult to return to the old regime from what i have heard  said pierre  blushing and breaking into the conversation  almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to bonaparte s side it is the buonapartists who say that  replied the vicomte without looking at pierre  at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public opinion bonaparte has said so  remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him  though without looking at him i showed them the path to glory  but they did not follow it  prince andrew continued after a short silence  again quoting napoleon s words i opened my antechambers and they crowded in  i do not know how far he was justified in saying so not in the least  replied the vicomte  after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero  if to some people  he went on  turning to anna pavlovna  he ever was a hero after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth before anna pavlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte s epigram  pierre again broke into the conversation  and though anna pavlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate  she was unable to stop him the execution of the duc d enghien  declared monsieur pierre  was a political necessity  and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed dieu  mon dieu  muttered anna pavlovna in a terrified whisper what  monsieur pierre  do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul  said the little princess  smiling and drawing her work nearer to her oh  oh  exclaimed several voices capital  said prince hippolyte in english  and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders  pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued i say so  he continued desperately  because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy  and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it  and so for the general good he could not stop short for the sake of one man s life won t you come over to the other table  suggested anna pavlovna but pierre continued his speech without heeding her no  cried he  becoming more and more eager  napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution  suppressed its abuses  preserved all that was good in it equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press and only for that reason did he obtain power yes  if having obtained power  without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king  i should have called him a great man  remarked the vicomte he could not do that  the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man  the revolution was a grand thing  continued monsieur pierre  betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind what  revolution and regicide a grand thing  well  after that  but won t you come to this other table  repeated anna pavlovna rousseau s contrat social  said the vicomte with a tolerant smile i am not speaking of regicide  i am speaking about ideas yes  ideas of robbery  murder  and regicide  again interjected an ironical voice those were extremes  no doubt  but they are not what is most important what is important are the rights of man  emancipation from prejudices and equality of citizenship  and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full force liberty and equality  said the vicomte contemptuously  as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were high sounding words which have long been discredited  who does not love liberty and equality  even our saviour preached liberty and equality have people since the revolution become happier  on the contrary  we wanted liberty  but buonaparte has destroyed it prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess  in the first moment of pierre s outburst anna pavlovna  despite her social experience  was horror struck  but when she saw that pierre s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte  and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him  she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator but  my dear monsieur pierre  said she  how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc or even an ordinary man who is innocent and untried i should like  said the vicomte  to ask how monsieur explains the th brumaire  was not that an imposture  it was a swindle  and not at all like the conduct of a great man and the prisoners he killed in africa  that was horrible  said the little princess  shrugging her shoulders he s a low fellow  say what you will  remarked prince hippolyte pierre  not knowing whom to answer  looked at them all and smiled  his smile was unlike the half smile of other people  when he smiled  his grave  even rather gloomy  look was instantaneously replaced by another a childlike  kindly  even rather silly look  which seemed to ask forgiveness the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested  all were silent how do you expect him to answer you all at once  said prince andrew besides  in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person  as a general  and as an emperor  so it seems to me yes  yes  of course  pierre chimed in  pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement one must admit  continued prince andrew  that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola  and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague stricken  but  but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify prince andrew  who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of pierre s remarks  rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend and asking them all to be seated began i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it excuse me  vicomte i must tell it in russian or the point will be lost  and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia everyone waited  so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story there is in moscow a lady  une dame  and she is very stingy  she must have two footmen behind her carriage  and very big ones  that was her taste  and she had a lady s maid  also big  she said here prince hippolyte paused  evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty she said  oh yes  she said  girl  to the maid  put on a livery get up behind the carriage  and come with me while i make some calls here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience  which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator  several persons  among them the elderly lady and anna pavlovna  did however smile she went  suddenly there was a great wind  the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down  here he could contain himself no longer and went on  between gasps of laughter  and the whole world knew and so the anecdote ended  though it was unintelligible why he had told it  or why it had to be told in russian  still anna pavlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolyte s social tact in so agreeably ending pierre s unpleasant and unamiable outburst  after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls  about theatricals  and who would meet whom  and when and where chapter vi having thanked anna pavlovna for her charming soiree  the guests began to take their leave pierre was ungainly  stout  about the average height  broad  with huge red hands  he did not know  as the saying is  how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one  that is  how to say something particularly agreeable before going away  besides this he was absent minded  when he rose to go  he took up instead of his own  the general s three cornered hat  and held it  pulling at the plume  till the general asked him to restore it  all his absent mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was  however  redeemed by his kindly simple  and modest expression  anna pavlovna turned toward him and  with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion nodded and said  i hope to see you again  but i also hope you will change your opinions  my dear monsieur pierre when she said this  he did not reply and only bowed  but again everybody saw his smile  which said nothing  unless perhaps  opinions are opinions  but you see what a capital  good natured fellow i am  and everyone  including anna pavlovna  felt this prince andrew had gone out into the hall  and  turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak  listened indifferently to his wife s chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall  prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty  pregnant princess  and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass go in  annette  or you will catch cold  said the little princess taking leave of anna pavlovna  it is settled  she added in a low voice anna pavlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess  sister in law i rely on you  my dear  said anna pavlovna  also in a low tone  write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter  au revoir and she left the hall prince hippolyte approached the little princess and  bending his face close to her  began to whisper something two footmen  the princess  and his own  stood holding a shawl and a cloak  waiting for the conversation to finish  they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless  with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so  the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador s  said prince hippolyte so dull  it has been a delightful evening  has it not  delightful they say the ball will be very good  replied the princess  drawing up her downy little lip  all the pretty women in society will be there not all  for you will not be there  not all  said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully  and snatching the shawl from the footman  whom he even pushed aside  he began wrapping it round the princess  either from awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which  after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time  as though embracing her still smiling  she gracefully moved away  turning and glancing at her husband  prince andrew s eyes were closed  so weary and sleepy did he seem are you ready  he asked his wife  looking past her prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak  which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels  and  stumbling in it  ran out into the porch following the princess  whom a footman was helping into the carriage princesse  au revoir  cried he  stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet the princess  picking up her dress  was taking her seat in the dark carriage  her husband was adjusting his saber  prince hippolyte  under pretense of helping  was in everyone s way allow me  sir  said prince andrew in russian in a cold  disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path i am expecting you  pierre  said the same voice  but gently and affectionately the postilion started  the carriage wheels rattled  prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home well  mon cher  said the vicomte  having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage  your little princess is very nice  very nice indeed  quite french  and he kissed the tips of his fingers  hippolyte burst out laughing do you know  you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs continued the vicomte  i pity the poor husband  that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch hippolyte spluttered again  and amid his laughter said  and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french  one has to know how to deal with them pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew s study like one quite at home  and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa  took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was caesar s commentaries  and resting on his elbow  began reading it in the middle what have you done to mlle scherer  she will be quite ill now  said prince andrew  as he entered the study  rubbing his small white hands pierre turned his whole body  making the sofa creak  he lifted his eager face to prince andrew  smiled  and waved his hand that abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light  in my opinion perpetual peace is possible but i do not know how to express it  not by a balance of political power it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation one can t everywhere say all one thinks  mon cher  well  have you at last decided on anything  are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist  asked prince andrew after a momentary silence pierre sat up on the sofa  with his legs tucked under him really  i don t yet know  i don t like either the one or the other but you must decide on something  your father expects it pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor  and had remained away till he was twenty  when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man  now go to petersburg  look round  and choose your profession  i will agree to anything  here is a letter to prince vasili  and here is money  write to me all about it  and i will help you in everything  pierre had already been choosing a career for three months  and had not decided on anything  it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking pierre rubbed his forehead but he must be a freemason  said he  referring to the abbe whom he had met that evening that is all nonsense  prince andrew again interrupted him  let us talk business  have you been to the horse guards no  i have not  but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you  there is a war now against napoleon  if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not right prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre s childish words  he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naive question if no one fought except on his own conviction  there would be no wars he said and that would be splendid  said pierre prince andrew smiled ironically very likely it would be splendid  but it will never come about well  why are you going to the war  asked pierre what for  i don t know  i must  besides that i am going  he paused i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me chapter vii the rustle of a woman s dress was heard in the next room  prince andrew shook himself as if waking up  and his face assumed the look it had had in anna pavlovna s drawing room  pierre removed his feet from the sofa the princess came in  she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other  prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her how is it  she began  as usual in french  settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair  how is it annette never got married  how stupid you men all are not to have married her  excuse me for saying so but you have no sense about women  what an argumentative fellow you are monsieur pierre and i am still arguing with your husband  i can t understand why he wants to go to the war  replied pierre  addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women the princess started  evidently pierre s words touched her to the quick ah  that is just what i tell him  said she  i don t understand it  i don t in the least understand why men can t live without wars  how is it that we women don t want anything of the kind  don t need it  now you shall judge between us  i always tell him  here he is uncle s aide de camp  a most brilliant position  he is so well known  so much appreciated by everyone  the other day at the apraksins  i heard a lady asking  is that the famous prince andrew  i did indeed  she laughed he is so well received everywhere  he might easily become aide de camp to the emperor  you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it  what do you think pierre looked at his friend and  noticing that he did not like the conversation  gave no reply when are you starting  he asked oh  don t speak of his going  don t  i won t hear it spoken of  said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill suited to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member  today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know  andre  she looked significantly at her husband i m afraid  i m afraid  she whispered  and a shudder ran down her back her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room  and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness what is it you are afraid of  lise  i don t understand  said he there  what egotists men all are  all  all egotists  just for a whim of his own  goodness only knows why  he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country with my father and sister  remember  said prince andrew gently alone all the same  without my friends  and he expects me not to be afraid her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up  giving her not a joyful  but an animal  squirrel like expression  she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre  though the gist of the matter lay in that i still can t understand what you are afraid of  said prince andrew slowly  not taking his eyes off his wife the princess blushed  and raised her arms with a gesture of despair no  andrew  i must say you have changed  oh  how you have your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier  said prince andrew  you had better go the princess said nothing  but suddenly her short downy lip quivered prince andrew rose  shrugged his shoulders  and walked about the room pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise  now at him and now at her  moved as if about to rise too  but changed his mind why should i mind monsieur pierre being here  exclaimed the little princess suddenly  her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace  i have long wanted to ask you  andrew  why you have changed so to me  what have i done to you  you are going to the war and have no pity for me  why is it lise  was all prince andrew said  but that one word expressed an entreaty  a threat  and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words  but she went on hurriedly you treat me like an invalid or a child  i see it all  did you behave like that six months ago lise  i beg you to desist  said prince andrew still more emphatically pierre  who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this  rose and approached the princess  he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself calm yourself  princess  it seems so to you because  i assure you i myself have experienced  and so  because  no  excuse me  an outsider is out of place here  no  don t distress yourself  good bye prince andrew caught him by the hand no  wait  pierre  the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you no  he thinks only of himself  muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears lise  said prince andrew dryly  raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted suddenly the angry  squirrel like expression of the princess  pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear  her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband s face  and her own assumed the timid deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail mon dieu  mon dieu  she muttered  and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead good night  lise  said he  rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger chapter viii the friends were silent  neither cared to begin talking  pierre continually glanced at prince andrew  prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand let us go and have supper  he said with a sigh  going to the door they entered the elegant  newly decorated  and luxurious dining room everything from the table napkins to the silver  china  and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face  began to talk as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out never  never marry  my dear fellow  that s my advice  never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of  and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is  or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake  marry when you are old and good for nothing or all that is good and noble in you will be lost  it will all be wasted on trifles yes  yes  yes  don t look at me with such surprise  if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future  you will feel at every step that for you all is ended  all is closed except the drawing room where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot  but what s the good  and he waved his arm pierre took off his spectacles  which made his face seem different and the good natured expression still more apparent  and gazed at his friend in amazement my wife  continued prince andrew  is an excellent woman  one of those rare women with whom a man s honor is safe  but  o god  what would i not give now to be unmarried  you are the first and only one to whom i mention this  because i like you as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkonski who had lolled in anna pavlovna s easy chairs and with half closed eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth  every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement  his eyes  in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished  now flashed with brilliant light  it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times  the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation you don t understand why i say this  he continued  but it is the whole story of life  you talk of bonaparte and his career  said he though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte  but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal  he was free  he had nothing but his aim to consider  and he reached it  but tie yourself up with a woman and  like a chained convict  you lose all freedom  and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret  drawing rooms  gossip  balls  vanity  and triviality these are the enchanted circle i cannot escape from  i am now going to the war the greatest war there ever was  and i know nothing and am fit for nothing  i am very amiable and have a caustic wit  continued prince andrew  and at anna pavlovna s they listen to me  and that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist  and those women  if you only knew what those society women are  and women in general  my father is right selfish  vain  stupid  trivial in everything that s what women are when you see them in their true colors  when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them  but there s nothing  nothing nothing  no  don t marry  my dear fellow  don t marry  concluded prince andrew it seems funny to me  said pierre  that you  you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life  you have everything before you  everything  and you he did not finish his sentence  but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future how can he talk like that  thought pierre  he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked  and which might be best described as strength of will  pierre was always astonished at prince andrew s calm manner of treating everybody  his extraordinary memory his extensive reading he had read everything  knew everything  and had an opinion about everything  but above all at his capacity for work and study  and if pierre was often struck by andrew s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly addicted  he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength even in the best  most friendly and simplest relations of life  praise and commendation are essential  just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly my part is played out  said prince andrew  what s the use of talking about me  let us talk about you  he added after a silence  smiling at his reassuring thoughts that smile was immediately reflected on pierre s face but what is there to say about me  said pierre  his face relaxing into a careless  merry smile  what am i  an illegitimate son  he suddenly blushed crimson  and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this  without a name and without means  and it really  but he did not say what it really  was  for the present i am free and am all right  only i haven t the least idea what i am to do  i wanted to consult you seriously prince andrew looked kindly at him  yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority i am fond of you  especially as you are the one live man among our whole set  yes  you re all right  choose what you will  it s all the same  you ll be all right anywhere  but look here  give up visiting those kuragins and leading that sort of life  it suits you so badly all this debauchery  dissipation  and the rest of it what would you have  my dear fellow  answered pierre  shrugging his shoulders  women  my dear fellow  women i don t understand it  replied prince andrew  women who are comme il faut  that s a different matter  but the kuragins  set of women  women and wine  i don t understand pierre was staying at prince vasili kuragin s and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole  the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrew s sister do you know  said pierre  as if suddenly struck by a happy thought seriously  i have long been thinking of it  leading such a life i can t decide or think properly about anything  one s head aches  and one spends all one s money  he asked me for tonight  but i won t go you give me your word of honor not to go on my honor chapter ix it was past one o clock when pierre left his friend  it was a cloudless northern  summer night  pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home  but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night  it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night  on the way pierre remembered that anatole kuragin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening  after which there was generally a drinking bout  finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of i should like to go to kuragin s  thought he but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there  then  as happens to people of weak character  he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go  the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account  because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering  besides thought he  all such words of honor  are conventional things with no definite meaning  especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead  or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same  pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort  nullifying all his decisions and intentions  he went to kuragin s reaching the large house near the horse guards  barracks  in which anatole lived  pierre entered the lighted porch  ascended the stairs and went in at the open door  there was no one in the anteroom  empty bottles  cloaks  and overshoes were lying about  there was a smell of alcohol  and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance cards and supper were over  but the visitors had not yet dispersed pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room  in which were the remains of supper  a footman  thinking no one saw him  was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses  from the third room came sounds of laughter  the shouting of familiar voices  the growling of a bear  and general commotion  some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window  three others were romping with a young bear  one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others i bet a hundred on stevens  shouted one mind  no holding on  cried another i bet on dolokhov  cried a third  kuragin  you part our hands there  leave bruin alone  here s a bet on at one draught  or he loses  shouted a fourth jacob  bring a bottle  shouted the host  a tall  handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group  without a coat  and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front  wait a bit  you fellows  here is petya good man  cried he  addressing pierre another voice  from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring cried from the window  come here  part the bets  this was dolokhov  an officer of the semenov regiment  a notorious gambler and duelist  who was living with anatole  pierre smiled  looking about him merrily i don t understand  what s it all about wait a bit  he is not drunk yet  a bottle here  said anatole  taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre first of all you must drink pierre drank one glass after another  looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window  and listening to their chatter  anatole kept on refilling pierre s glass while explaining that dolokhov was betting with stevens  an english naval officer  that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out go on  you must drink it all  said anatole  giving pierre the last glass  or i won t let you go no  i won t  said pierre  pushing anatole aside  and he went up to the window dolokhov was holding the englishman s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet  addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre dolokhov was of medium height  with curly hair and light blue eyes  he was about twenty five  like all infantry officers he wore no mustache so that his mouth  the most striking feature of his face  was clearly seen  the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved  the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one  and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth  this  together with the resolute insolent intelligence of his eyes  produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face  dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections  yet  though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles dolokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them  including anatole himself  respected him more than they did anatole  dolokhov could play all games and nearly always won however much he drank  he never lost his clearheadedness  both kuragin and dolokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg the bottle of rum was brought  the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen  who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window  he wanted to smash something  pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame  but could not move it  he smashed a pane you have a try  hercules  said he  turning to pierre pierre seized the crossbeam  tugged  and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash take it right out  or they ll think i m holding on  said dolokhov is the englishman bragging  eh  is it all right  said anatole first rate  said pierre  looking at dolokhov  who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window  from which the light of the sky the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset  was visible dolokhov  the bottle of rum still in his hand  jumped onto the window sill  listen  cried he  standing there and addressing those in the room  all were silent i bet fifty imperials he spoke french that the englishman might understand him  but he did not speak it very well i bet fifty imperials  or do you wish to make it a hundred  added he  addressing the englishman no  fifty  replied the latter all right  fifty imperials  that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth  sitting outside the window on this spot  he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window and without holding on to anything  is that right quite right  said the englishman anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him the englishman was short began repeating the terms of the wager to him in english wait  cried dolokhov  hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention  wait a bit  kuragin  listen  if anyone else does the same  i will pay him a hundred imperials  do you understand the englishman nodded  but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not  anatole did not release him  and though he kept nodding to show that he understood  anatole went on translating dolokhov s words into english  a thin young lad  an hussar of the life guards  who had been losing that evening  climbed on the window sill leaned over  and looked down oh  oh  oh  he muttered  looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement shut up  cried dolokhov  pushing him away from the window  the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room  tripping over his spurs placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs  pressing against both sides of the window  he adjusted himself on his seat  lowered his hands  moved a little to the right and then to the left  and took up the bottle  anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill  though it was already quite light  dolokhov s back in his white shirt  and his curly head  were lit up from both sides  everyone crowded to the window  the englishman in front  pierre stood smiling but silent  one man  older than the others present suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of dolokhov s shirt i say  this is folly  he ll be killed  said this more sensible man anatole stopped him don t touch him  you ll startle him and then he ll be killed  eh what then  eh dolokhov turned round and  again holding on with both hands  arranged himself on his seat if anyone comes meddling again  said he  emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips  i will throw him down there  now then saying this he again turned round  dropped his hands  took the bottle and lifted it to his lips  threw back his head  and raised his free hand to balance himself  one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from dolokhov s back  anatole stood erect with staring eyes the englishman looked on sideways  pursing up his lips  the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall  pierre hid his face  from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear  all were still  pierre took his hands from his eyes  dolokhov still sat in the same position  only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar  and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort  the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back  why is it so long  thought pierre  it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed  suddenly dolokhov made a backward movement with his spine  and his arm trembled nervously  this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge  as he began slipping down  his head and arm wavered still more with the strain  one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill  but refrained from touching it  pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again  suddenly he was aware of a stir all around he looked up  dolokhov was standing on the window sill  with a pale but radiant face it s empty he threw the bottle to the englishman  who caught it neatly  dolokhov jumped down  he smelt strongly of rum well done  fine fellow  there s a bet for you  devil take you  came from different sides the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak  pierre jumped upon the window sill gentlemen  who wishes to bet with me  i ll do the same thing  he suddenly cried  even without a bet  there  tell them to bring me a bottle  i ll do it  bring a bottle let him do it  let him do it  said dolokhov  smiling what next  have you gone mad  no one would let you  why  you go giddy even on a staircase  exclaimed several voices i ll drink it  let s have a bottle of rum  shouted pierre  banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window they seized him by his arms  but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying no  you ll never manage him that way  said anatole  wait a bit and i ll get round him  listen  i ll take your bet tomorrow  but now we are all going to s come on then  cried pierre  come on  and we ll take bruin with us and he caught the bear  took it in his arms  lifted it from the ground and began dancing round the room with it chapter x prince vasili kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son boris on the evening of anna pavlovna s soiree  the matter was mentioned to the emperor  an exception made  and boris transferred into the regiment of semenov guards with the rank of cornet  he received  however  no appointment to kutuzov s staff despite all anna mikhaylovna s endeavors and entreaties  soon after anna pavlovna s reception anna mikhaylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations  the rostovs  with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling bory  who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet  had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time  the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august  and her son  who had remained in moscow for his equipment  was to join them on the march to radzivilov it was st  natalia s day and the name day of two of the rostovs the mother and the youngest daughter both named nataly  ever since the morning  carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually  bringing visitors to the countess rostova s big house on the povarskaya  so well known to all moscow  the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate  and who constantly succeeded one another in relays the countess was a woman of about forty five  with a thin oriental type of face  evidently worn out with childbearing she had had twelve  a languor of motion and speech  resulting from weakness  gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect  princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya  who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room  helped to receive and entertain the visitors  the young people were in one of the inner rooms  not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors  the count met the guests and saw them off  inviting them all to dinner i am very  very grateful to you  mon cher  or ma chere he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone  my dear  whether they were above or below him in rank i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended  ma chere  on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come  mon cher  these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation  and with the same expression on his full  cheerful  clean shaven face  the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick  repeated bows  as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room  drew a chair toward him or her  and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live  he swayed to and fro with dignity offered surmises about the weather  or touched on questions of health sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but self confident french  then again  like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty  he rose to see some visitors off and  stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch  also asked them to dinner  sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall  where tables were being set out for eighty people  and looking at the footmen  who were bringing in silver and china  moving tables  and unfolding damask table linen  he would call dmitri vasilevich  a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs  and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say  well  dmitri  you ll see that things are all as they should be  that s right  the great thing is the serving  that s it  and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room marya lvovna karagina and her daughter  announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice  entering the drawing room  the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband s portrait on it i m quite worn out by these callers  however  i ll see her and no more she is so affected  ask her in  she said to the footman in a sad voice as if saying  very well  finish me off a tall  stout  and proud looking woman  with a round faced smiling daughter  entered the drawing room  their dresses rustling dear countess  what an age  she has been laid up  poor child  at the razumovski s ball  and countess apraksina  i was so delighted  came the sounds of animated feminine voices  interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs  then one of those conversations began which last out until at the first pause  the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say  i am so delighted  mamma s health  and countess apraksina  and then  again rustling  pass into the anteroom  put on cloaks or mantles and drive away  the conversation was on the chief topic of the day  the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherine s day  count bezukhov  and about his illegitimate son pierre  the one who had behaved so improperly at anna pavlovna s reception i am so sorry for the poor count  said the visitor  he is in such bad health  and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him what is that  asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to  though she had already heard about the cause of count bezukhov s distress some fifteen times that s what comes of a modern education  exclaimed the visitor  it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked  now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police you don t say so  replied the countess he chose his friends badly  interposed anna mikhaylovna  prince vasili s son  he  and a certain dolokhov have  it is said  been up to heaven only knows what  and they have had to suffer for it  dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and bezukhov s son sent back to moscow anatole kuragin s father managed somehow to get his son s affair hushed up  but even he was ordered out of petersburg but what have they been up to  asked the countess they are regular brigands  especially dolokhov  replied the visitor he is a son of marya ivanovna dolokhova  such a worthy woman  but there  just fancy  those three got hold of a bear somewhere  put it in a carriage  and set off with it to visit some actresses  the police tried to interfere  and what did the young men do  they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal  and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back what a nice figure the policeman must have cut  my dear  shouted the count  dying with laughter oh  how dreadful  how can you laugh at it  count yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing it was all they could do to rescue the poor man  continued the visitor  and to think it is cyril vladimirovich bezukhov s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner  and he was said to be so well educated and clever  this is all that his foreign education has done for him  i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him  in spite of his money  they wanted to introduce him to me  but i quite declined  i have my daughters to consider why do you say this young man is so rich  asked the countess  turning away from the girls  who at once assumed an air of inattention  his children are all illegitimate  i think pierre also is illegitimate the visitor made a gesture with her hand i should think he has a score of them princess anna mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation  evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society the fact of the matter is  said she significantly  and also in a half whisper  everyone knows count cyril s reputation  he has lost count of his children  but this pierre was his favorite how handsome the old man still was only a year ago  remarked the countess  i have never seen a handsomer man he is very much altered now  said anna mikhaylovna  well  as i was saying  prince vasili is the next heir through his wife  but the count is very fond of pierre  looked after his education  and wrote to the emperor about him  so that in the case of his death and he is so ill that he may die at any moment  and dr  lorrain has come from petersburg no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune  pierre or prince vasili  forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles  i know it all very well for prince vasili told me himself  besides  cyril vladimirovich is my mother s second cousin  he s also my bory s godfather  she added  as if she attached no importance at all to the fact prince vasili arrived in moscow yesterday  i hear he has come on some inspection business  remarked the visitor yes  but between ourselves  said the princess  that is a pretext  the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladimirovich  hearing how ill he is but do you know  my dear  that was a capital joke  said the count  and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening  he turned to the young ladies  i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman  his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh  the laugh of one who always eats well and  in particular  drinks well  so do come and dine with us  he said chapter xi silence ensued  the countess looked at her callers  smiling affably  but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave  the visitor s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother  when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over  and a girl of thirteen hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock  darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room  it was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far  behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar  an officer of the guards a girl of fifteen  and a plump rosy faced boy in a short jacket the count jumped up and  swaying from side to side  spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in ah  here she is  he exclaimed laughing  my pet  whose name day it is my dear pet ma chere  there is a time for everything  said the countess with feigned severity  you spoil her  ilya  she added  turning to her husband how do you do  my dear  i wish you many happy returns of your name day  said the visitor  what a charming child  she added  addressing the mother this black eyed  wide mouthed girl  not pretty but full of life with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice with black curls tossed backward  thin bare arms  little legs in lace frilled drawers  and feet in low slippers was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child  though the child is not yet a young woman  escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother s mantilla not paying the least attention to her severe remark and began to laugh  she laughed  and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock do you see  my doll  mimi  you see  was all natasha managed to utter to her everything seemed funny  she leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud  ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in now then  go away and take your monstrosity with you  said the mother pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness  and turning to the visitor she added  she is my youngest girl natasha  raising her face for a moment from her mother s mantilla glanced up at her through tears of laughter  and again hid her face the visitor  compelled to look on at this family scene  thought it necessary to take some part in it tell me  my dear  said she to natasha  is mimi a relation of yours  a daughter  i suppose natasha did not like the visitor s tone of condescension to childish things  she did not reply  but looked at her seriously meanwhile the younger generation  boris  the officer  anna mikhaylovna s son  nicholas  the undergraduate  the count s eldest son  sonya  the count s fifteen year old niece  and little petya  his youngest boy  had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces  evidently in the back rooms  from which they had dashed out so impetuously  the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals  the weather  and countess apraksina  now and then they glanced at one another  hardly able to suppress their laughter the two young men  the student and the officer  friends from childhood were of the same age and both handsome fellows  though not alike  boris was tall and fair  and his calm and handsome face had regular  delicate features  nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip  and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm  nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room  he evidently tried to find something to say  but failed  boris on the contrary at once found his footing  and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was still quite a young lady  before her nose was broken  how she had aged during the five years he had known her  and how her head had cracked right across the skull  having said this he glanced at natasha  she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother  who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter  and unable to control herself any longer  she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her  boris did not laugh you were meaning to go out  weren t you  mamma  do you want the carriage  he asked his mother with a smile yes  yes  go and tell them to get it ready  she answered  returning his smile boris quietly left the room and went in search of natasha  the plump boy ran after them angrily  as if vexed that their program had been disturbed chapter xii the only young people remaining in the drawing room  not counting the young lady visitor and the countess  eldest daughter who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown up person  were nicholas and sonya  the niece  sonya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes  thick black plaits coiling twice round her head  and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck  by the grace of her movements  by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs  and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner  she reminded one of a pretty  half grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat  she evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling  but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army  with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone  and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could  like natasha and boris  escape from the drawing room ah yes  my dear  said the count  addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas  his friend boris has become an officer  and so for friendship s sake he is leaving the university and me  his old father and entering the military service  my dear  and there was a place and everything waiting for him in the archives department  isn t that friendship  remarked the count in an inquiring tone but they say that war has been declared  replied the visitor they ve been saying so a long while  said the count  and they ll say so again and again  and that will be the end of it  my dear  there s friendship for you  he repeated  he s joining the hussars the visitor  not knowing what to say  shook her head it s not at all from friendship  declared nicholas  flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion  it is not from friendship at all  i simply feel that the army is my vocation he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor  and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation schubert  the colonel of the pavlograd hussars  is dining with us today  he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him it can t be helped  said the count  shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him i have already told you  papa  said his son  that if you don t wish to let me go  i ll stay  but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army  i am not a diplomat or a government clerk i don t know how to hide what i feel  as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sonya and the young lady visitor the little kitten  feasting her eyes on him  seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature all right  all right  said the old count  he always flares up  this buonaparte has turned all their heads  they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor  well  well  god grant it  he added not noticing his visitor s sarcastic smile the elders began talking about bonaparte  julie karagina turned to young rostov what a pity you weren t at the arkharovs  on thursday  it was so dull without you  said she  giving him a tender smile the young man  flattered  sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile  and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sonya  who blushed and smiled unnaturally  in the midst of his talk he glanced round at her  she gave him a passionately angry glance  and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips  she got up and left the room  all nicholas  animation vanished  he waited for the first pause in the conversation  and then with a distressed face left the room to find sonya how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves said anna mikhaylovna  pointing to nicholas as he went out  cousinage dangereux voisinage   she added  cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood yes  said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished  and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind  and how much suffering how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now  and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy  one is always  always anxious  especially just at this age  so dangerous both for girls and boys it all depends on the bringing up  remarked the visitor yes  you re quite right  continued the countess  till now i have always  thank god  been my children s friend and had their full confidence  said she  repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them  i know i shall always be my daughters  first confidante  and that if nicholas  with his impulsive nature  does get into mischief a boy can t help it  he will all the same never be like those petersburg young men yes  they are splendid  splendid youngsters  chimed in the count  who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid  just fancy  wants to be an hussar  what s one to do  my dear what a charming creature your younger girl is  said the visitor  a little volcano yes  a regular volcano  said the count  takes after me  and what a voice she has  though she s my daughter  i tell the truth when i say she ll be a singer  a second salomoni  we have engaged an italian to give her lessons isn t she too young  i have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age oh no  not at all too young  replied the count  why  our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen and she s in love with boris already  just fancy  said the countess with a gentle smile  looking at boris and went on  evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her  now you see if i were to be severe with her and to forbid it  goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly  she meant that they would be kissing  but as it is  i know every word she utters  she will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything  perhaps i spoil her  but really that seems the best plan  with her elder sister i was stricter yes  i was brought up quite differently  remarked the handsome elder daughter  countess vera  with a smile but the smile did not enhance vera s beauty as smiles generally do  on the contrary it gave her an unnatural  and therefore unpleasant expression  vera was good looking  not at all stupid  quick at learning was well brought up  and had a pleasant voice  what she said was true and appropriate  yet  strange to say  everyone the visitors and countess alike turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it  and they all felt awkward people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them  said the visitor what s the good of denying it  my dear  our dear countess was too clever with vera  said the count  well  what of that  she s turned out splendidly all the same  he added  winking at vera the guests got up and took their leave  promising to return to dinner what manners  i thought they would never go  said the countess  when she had seen her guests out chapter xiii when natasha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory  there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room  waiting for boris to come out  she was already growing impatient  and stamped her foot  ready to cry at his not coming at once  when she heard the young man s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly  at this natasha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there boris paused in the middle of the room  looked round  brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform  and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face  natasha  very still  peered out from her ambush waiting to see what he would do  he stood a little while before the glass  smiled  and walked toward the other door  natasha was about to call him but changed her mind  let him look for me  thought she hardly had boris gone than sonya  flushed  in tears  and muttering angrily  came in at the other door  natasha checked her first impulse to run out to her  and remained in her hiding place  watching as under an invisible cap to see what went on in the world  she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure  sonya  muttering to herself  kept looking round toward the drawing room door  it opened and nicholas came in sonya  what is the matter with you  how can you  said he  running up to her it s nothing  nothing  leave me alone  sobbed sonya ah  i know what it is well  if you do  so much the better  and you can go back to her so o onya  look here  how can you torture me and yourself like that for a mere fancy  said nicholas taking her hand sonya did not pull it away  and left off crying  natasha  not stirring and scarcely breathing  watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes what will happen now  thought she sonya  what is anyone in the world to me  you alone are everything said nicholas  and i will prove it to you i don t like you to talk like that well  then  i won t  only forgive me  sonya  he drew her to him and kissed her oh  how nice  thought natasha  and when sonya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called boris to her boris  come here  said she with a sly and significant look  i have something to tell you  here  here  and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding boris followed her  smiling what is the something  asked he she grew confused  glanced round  and  seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs  picked it up kiss the doll  said she boris looked attentively and kindly at her eager face  but did not reply don t you want to  well  then  come here  said she  and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll  closer  closer  she whispered she caught the young officer by his cuffs  and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face and me  would you like to kiss me  she whispered almost inaudibly glancing up at him from under her brows  smiling  and almost crying from excitement boris blushed how funny you are  he said  bending down to her and blushing still more  but he waited and did nothing suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he  embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck  and  tossing back her hair  kissed him full on the lips then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood  hanging her head natasha  he said  you know that i love you  but you are in love with me  natasha broke in yes  i am  but please don t let us do like that  in another four years  then i will ask for your hand natasha considered thirteen  fourteen  fifteen  sixteen  she counted on her slender little fingers  all right  then it s settled a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face settled  replied boris forever  said the little girl  till death itself she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room chapter xiv after receiving her visitors  the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more  but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to congratulate  the countess wished to have a t te t te talk with the friend of her childhood  princess anna mikhaylovna  whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg  anna mikhaylovna  with her tear worn but pleasant face  drew her chair nearer to that of the countess with you i will be quite frank  said anna mikhaylovna  there are not many left of us old friends  that s why i so value your friendship anna mikhaylovna looked at vera and paused  the countess pressed her friend s hand vera  she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite  how is it you have so little tact  don t you see you are not wanted here  go to the other girls  or the handsome vera smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt if you had told me sooner  mamma  i would have gone  she replied as she rose to go to her own room but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting  one pair at each window  she stopped and smiled scornfully  sonya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her  the first he had ever written  boris and natasha were at the other window and ceased talking when vera entered  sonya and natasha looked at vera with guilty  happy faces it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love  but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in vera how often have i asked you not to take my things  she said  you have a room of your own  and she took the inkstand from nicholas in a minute  in a minute  he said  dipping his pen you always manage to do things at the wrong time  continued vera  you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you though what she said was quite just  perhaps for that very reason no one replied  and the four simply looked at one another  she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand and at your age what secrets can there be between natasha and boris  or between you two  it s all nonsense now  vera  what does it matter to you  said natasha in defense speaking very gently she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone very silly  said vera  i am ashamed of you  secrets indeed all have secrets of their own  answered natasha  getting warmer  we don t interfere with you and berg i should think not  said vera  because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior  but i ll just tell mamma how you are behaving with boris natalya ilynichna behaves very well to me  remarked boris  i have nothing to complain of don t  boris  you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome  said natasha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly  she used the word diplomat  which was just then much in vogue among the children  in the special sense they attached to it  why does she bother me  and she added  turning to vera  you ll never understand it  because you ve never loved anyone  you have no heart  you are a madame de genlis and nothing more  this nickname  bestowed on vera by nicholas  was considered very stinging  and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people  go and flirt with berg as much as you please  she finished quickly i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors well  now you ve done what you wanted  put in nicholas said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them  let s go to the nursery all four  like a flock of scared birds  got up and left the room the unpleasant things were said to me  remarked vera  i said none to anyone madame de genlis  madame de genlis  shouted laughing voices through the door the handsome vera  who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone  smiled and  evidently unmoved by what had been said to her went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf  looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer in the drawing room the conversation was still going on ah  my dear  said the countess  my life is not all roses either don t i know that at the rate we are living our means won t last long it s all the club and his easygoing nature  even in the country do we get any rest  theatricals  hunting  and heaven knows what besides  but don t let s talk about me  tell me how you managed everything  i often wonder at you  annette how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow  to petersburg  to those ministers and great people and know how to deal with them all  it s quite astonishing  how did you get things settled  i couldn t possibly do it ah  my love  answered anna mikhaylovna  god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction  one learns many things then  she added with a certain pride  that lawsuit taught me much  when i want to see one of those big people i write a note  princess so and so desires an interview with so and so  and then i take a cab and go myself two  three  or four times till i get what i want  i don t mind what they think of me well  and to whom did you apply about bory  asked the countess  you see yours is already an officer in the guards  while my nicholas is going as a cadet  there s no one to interest himself for him  to whom did you apply to prince vasili  he was so kind  he at once agreed to everything  and put the matter before the emperor  said princess anna mikhaylovna enthusiastically  quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end has prince vasili aged much  asked the countess  i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyantsovs  theatricals  i expect he has forgotten me  he paid me attentions in those days  said the countess with a smile he is just the same as ever  replied anna mikhaylovna  overflowing with amiability  his position has not turned his head at all  he said to me  i am sorry i can do so little for you  dear princess  i am at your command  yes  he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation  but nataly  you know my love for my son  i would do anything for his happiness  and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one  continued anna mikhaylovna  sadly  dropping her voice my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress  would you believe it  i have literally not a penny and don t know how to equip boris  she took out her handkerchief and began to cry  i need five hundred rubles  and have only one twenty five ruble note  i am in such a state  my only hope now is in count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov  if he will not assist his godson you know he is bory s godfather and allow him something for his maintenance  all my trouble will have been thrown away  i shall not be able to equip him the countess  eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence i often think  though  perhaps it s a sin  said the princess  that here lives count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov so rich  all alone  that tremendous fortune  and what is his life worth  it s a burden to him and bory s life is only just beginning surely he will leave something to boris  said the countess heaven only knows  my dear  these rich grandees are so selfish  still i will take boris and go to see him at once  and i shall speak to him straight out  let people think what they will of me  it s really all the same to me when my son s fate is at stake  the princess rose  it s now two o clock and you dine at four  there will just be time and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time  anna mikhaylovna sent someone to call her son  and went into the anteroom with him good bye  my dear  said she to the countess who saw her to the door and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear  wish me good luck are you going to count cyril vladimirovich  my dear  said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom  and he added  if he is better  ask pierre to dine with us  he has been to the house  you know  and danced with the children  be sure to invite him  my dear  we will see how taras distinguishes himself today  he says count orlov never gave such a dinner as ours will be chapter xv my dear boris  said princess anna mikhaylovna to her son as countess rostova s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov s house  my dear boris  said the mother drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son s arm  be affectionate and attentive to him  count cyril vladimirovich is your godfather after all  your future depends on him  remember that  my dear  and be nice to him  as you so well know how to be if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly  but i have promised and will do it for your sake although the hall porter saw someone s carriage standing at the entrance  after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches  and looking significantly at the lady s old cloak  he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses  and hearing that they wished to see the count  said his excellency was worse today  and that his excellency was not receiving anyone we may as well go back  said the son in french my dear  exclaimed his mother imploringly  again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him boris said no more  but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak my friend  said anna mikhaylovna in gentle tones  addressing the hall porter  i know count cyril vladimirovich is very ill  that s why i have come  i am a relation  i shall not disturb him  my friend  i only need see prince vasili sergeevich  he is staying here  is he not please announce me the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs  and turned away princess drubetskaya to see prince vasili sergeevich  he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches  shoes  and a swallow tail coat  who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror in the wall  and in her trodden down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs my dear  she said to her son  once more stimulating him by a touch you promised me the son  lowering his eyes  followed her quietly they entered the large hall  from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasili just as the mother and son  having reached the middle of the hall  were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered  the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasili came out wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast  as was his custom when at home taking leave of a good looking  dark haired man  this was the celebrated petersburg doctor  lorrain then it is certain  said the prince prince  humanum est errare   but  replied the doctor  swallowing his r s  and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent  to err is human very well  very well seeing anna mikhaylovna and her son  prince vasili dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry  the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother s face  and he smiled slightly ah  prince  in what sad circumstances we meet again  and how is our dear invalid  said she  as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her prince vasili stared at her and at boris questioningly and perplexed boris bowed politely  prince vasili without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikhaylovna  answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient is it possible  exclaimed anna mikhaylovna  oh  how awful  it is terrible to think  this is my son  she added  indicating boris  he wanted to thank you himself boris bowed again politely believe me  prince  a mother s heart will never forget what you have done for us i am glad i was able to do you a service  my dear anna mikhaylovna said prince vasili  arranging his lace frill  and in tone and manner here in moscow to anna mikhaylovna whom he had placed under an obligation  assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in petersburg at anna scherer s reception try to serve well and show yourself worthy  added he  addressing boris with severity  i am glad  are you here on leave  he went on in his usual tone of indifference i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment  your excellency  replied boris  betraying neither annoyance at the prince s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation  but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance are you living with your mother i am living at countess rostova s  replied boris  again adding  your excellency that is  with ilya rostov who married nataly shinshina  said anna mikhaylovna i know  i know  answered prince vasili in his monotonous voice  i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear  a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow  and a gambler too i am told but a very kind man  prince  said anna mikhaylovna with a pathetic smile  as though she too knew that count rostov deserved this censure but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man  what do the doctors say  asked the princess after a pause  her worn face again expressing deep sorrow they give little hope  replied the prince and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and boris  he is his godson  she added  her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give prince vasili much satisfaction prince vasili became thoughtful and frowned  anna mikhaylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezukhov s fortune and hastened to reassure him if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle  said she  uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern  i know his character  noble  upright  but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses  they are still young  she bent her head and continued in a whisper  has he performed his final duty prince  how priceless are those last moments  it can make things no worse  and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill  we women  prince  and she smiled tenderly  always know how to say these things  i absolutely must see him  however painful it may be for me  i am used to suffering evidently the prince understood her  and also understood  as he had done at anna pavlovna s  that it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikhaylovna would not such a meeting be too trying for him  dear anna mikhaylovna said he  let us wait until evening  the doctors are expecting a crisis but one cannot delay  prince  at such a moment  consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake  ah  it is awful  the duties of a christian a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses  the count s niece  entered with a cold  stern face  the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs  prince vasili turned to her well  how is he still the same  but what can you expect  this noise  said the princess  looking at anna mikhaylovna as at a stranger ah  my dear  i hardly knew you  said anna mikhaylovna with a happy smile  ambling lightly up to the count s niece  i have come  and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle  i imagine what you have gone through  and she sympathetically turned up her eyes the princess gave no reply and did not even smile  but left the room as anna mikhaylovna took off her gloves and  occupying the position she had conquered  settled down in an armchair  inviting prince vasili to take a seat beside her boris  she said to her son with a smile  i shall go in to see the count  my uncle  but you  my dear  had better go to pierre meanwhile and don t forget to give him the rostovs  invitation  they ask him to dinner  i suppose he won t go  she continued  turning to the prince on the contrary  replied the prince  who had plainly become depressed i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man  here he is  and the count has not once asked for him he shrugged his shoulders  a footman conducted boris down one flight of stairs and up another  to pierre s rooms chapter xvi pierre  after all  had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg  and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow  the story told about him at count rostov s was true pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear  he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his father s house though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his father who were never favorably disposed toward him would have used it to turn the count against him he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father s part of the house  entering the drawing room  where the princesses spent most of their time  he greeted the ladies  two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud  it was the eldest who was reading the one who had met anna mikhaylovna  the two younger ones were embroidering  both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier  pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper  the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes the second assumed precisely the same expression  while the youngest the one with the mole  who was of a cheerful and lively disposition bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw  she drew her wool down through the canvas and  scarcely able to refrain from laughing  stooped as if trying to make out the pattern how do you do  cousin  said pierre  you don t recognize me i recognize you only too well  too well how is the count  can i see him  asked pierre  awkwardly as usual  but unabashed the count is suffering physically and mentally  and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings can i see the count  pierre again asked hm  if you wish to kill him  to kill him outright  you can see him  olga  go and see whether uncle s beef tea is ready it is almost time  she added  giving pierre to understand that they were busy  and busy making his father comfortable  while evidently he  pierre  was only busy causing him annoyance olga went out  pierre stood looking at the sisters  then he bowed and said  then i will go to my rooms  you will let me know when i can see him and he left the room  followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole next day prince vasili had arrived and settled in the count s house  he sent for pierre and said to him  my dear fellow  if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg  you will end very badly  that is all i have to say to you  the count is very  very ill  and you must not see him at all since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs when boris appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall as if running a sword through an invisible foe  and glaring savagely over his spectacles  and then again resuming his walk  muttering indistinct words  shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating england is done for  said he  scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen  mr  pitt  as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man  is sentenced to  but before pierre who at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured london could pronounce pitt s sentence  he saw a well built and handsome young officer entering his room  pierre paused  he had left moscow when boris was a boy of fourteen  and had quite forgotten him  but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took boris by the hand with a friendly smile do you remember me  asked boris quietly with a pleasant smile  i have come with my mother to see the count  but it seems he is not well yes  it seems he is ill  people are always disturbing him  answered pierre  trying to remember who this young man was boris felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself  and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face count rostov asks you to come to dinner today  said he  after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable ah  count rostov  exclaimed pierre joyfully  then you are his son ilya  only fancy  i didn t know you at first  do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot  it s such an age you are mistaken  said boris deliberately  with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile  i am boris  son of princess anna mikhaylovna drubetskaya  rostov  the father  is ilya  and his son is nicholas  i never knew any madame jacquot pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees oh dear  what am i thinking about  i ve mixed everything up  one has so many relatives in moscow  so you are boris  of course  well  now we know where we are  and what do you think of the boulogne expedition  the english will come off badly  you know  if napoleon gets across the channel  i think the expedition is quite feasible  if only villeneuve doesn t make a mess of things boris knew nothing about the boulogne expedition  he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuve s name we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics  said he in his quiet ironical tone  i know nothing about it and have not thought about it  moscow is chiefly busy with gossip  he continued  just now they are talking about you and your father pierre smiled in his good natured way as if afraid for his companion s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret  but boris spoke distinctly  clearly  and dryly  looking straight into pierre s eyes moscow has nothing else to do but gossip  boris went on  everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune  though he may perhaps outlive us all  as i sincerely hope he will yes  it is all very horrid  interrupted pierre  very horrid pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself and it must seem to you  said boris flushing slightly  but not changing his tone or attitude  it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man so it does  thought pierre but i just wish to say  to avoid misunderstandings  that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people  we are very poor  but for my own part at any rate  for the very reason that your father is rich  i don t regard myself as a relation of his  and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him for a long time pierre could not understand  but when he did  he jumped up from the sofa  seized boris under the elbow in his quick  clumsy way and  blushing far more than boris  began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation well  this is strange  do you suppose i  who could think  i know very well but boris again interrupted him i am glad i have spoken out fully  perhaps you did not like it  you must excuse me  said he  putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him  but i hope i have not offended you  i always make it a rule to speak out  well  what answer am i to take  will you come to dinner at the rostovs and boris  having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it became quite pleasant again no  but i say  said pierre  calming down  you are a wonderful fellow what you have just said is good  very good  of course you don t know me we have not met for such a long time  not since we were children  you might think that i  i understand  quite understand  i could not have done it myself  i should not have had the courage  but it s splendid  i am very glad to have made your acquaintance  it s queer  he added after a pause  that you should have suspected me  he began to laugh  well what of it  i hope we ll get better acquainted  and he pressed boris hand  do you know  i have not once been in to see the count  he has not sent for me  i am sorry for him as a man  but what can one do and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across  asked boris with a smile pierre saw that boris wished to change the subject  and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition a footman came in to summon boris the princess was going  pierre  in order to make boris  better acquaintance  promised to come to dinner and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into boris  eyes  after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time  no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword  but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant intelligent  and resolute young man as often happens in early youth  especially to one who leads a lonely life  he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends prince vasili saw the princess off  she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful it is dreadful  dreadful  she was saying  but cost me what it may i shall do my duty  i will come and spend the night  he must not be left like this  every moment is precious  i can t think why his nieces put it off  perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him  adieu prince  may god support you adieu  ma bonne  answered prince vasili turning away from her oh  he is in a dreadful state  said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage  he hardly recognizes anybody i don t understand  mamma what is his attitude to pierre  asked the son the will will show that  my dear  our fate also depends on it but why do you expect that he will leave us anything ah  my dear  he is so rich  and we are so poor well  that is hardly a sufficient reason  mamma oh  heaven  how ill he is  exclaimed the mother chapter xvii after anna mikhaylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladimirovich bezukhov  countess rostova sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes  at last she rang what is the matter with you  my dear  she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes  don t you wish to serve me  then i ll find you another place the countess was upset by her friend s sorrow and humiliating poverty and was therefore out of sorts  a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear  and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness i am very sorry  ma am  answered the maid ask the count to come to me the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual well  little countess  what a saute of game au madere we are to have my dear  i tasted it  the thousand rubles i paid for taras were not ill spent  he is worth it he sat down by his wife  his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair what are your commands  little countess you see  my dear  what s that mess  she said  pointing to his waistcoat  it s the saute  most likely  she added with a smile  well you see  count  i want some money her face became sad oh  little countess  and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook i want a great deal  count  i want five hundred rubles  and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband s waistcoat yes  immediately  immediately  hey  who s there  he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons  send dmitri to me dmitri  a man of good family who had been brought up in the count s house and now managed all his affairs  stepped softly into the room this is what i want  my dear fellow  said the count to the deferential young man who had entered  bring me  he reflected a moment  yes bring me seven hundred rubles  yes  but mind  don t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time  but nice clean ones for the countess yes  dmitri  clean ones  please  said the countess  sighing deeply when would you like them  your excellency  asked dmitri  allow me to inform you  but  don t be uneasy  he added  noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger  i was forgetting  do you wish it brought at once yes  yes  just so  bring it  give it to the countess what a treasure that dmitri is  added the count with a smile when the young man had departed  there is never any impossible  with him that s a thing i hate  everything is possible ah  money  count  money  how much sorrow it causes in the world  said the countess  but i am in great need of this sum you  my little countess  are a notorious spendthrift  said the count and having kissed his wife s hand he went back to his study when anna mikhaylovna returned from count bezukhov s the money  all in clean notes  was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table  and anna mikhaylovna noticed that something was agitating her well  my dear  asked the countess oh  what a terrible state he is in  one would not know him  he is so ill  i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word annette  for heaven s sake don t refuse me  the countess began  with a blush that looked very strange on her thin  dignified  elderly face  and she took the money from under the handkerchief anna mikhaylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment this is for boris from me  for his outfit anna mikhaylovna was already embracing her and weeping  the countess wept too  they wept because they were friends  and because they were kindhearted  and because they friends from childhood had to think about such a base thing as money  and because their youth was over but those tears were pleasant to them both chapter xviii countess rostova  with her daughters and a large number of guests  was already seated in the drawing room  the count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes  from time to time he went out to ask  hasn t she come yet  they were expecting marya dmitrievna akhrosimova  known in society as le terrible dragon  a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank  but for common sense and frank plainness of speech  marya dmitrievna was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg  and both cities wondered at her  laughed privately at her rudenesses  and told good stories about her  while none the less all without exception respected and feared her in the count s room  which was full of tobacco smoke  they talked of war that had been announced in a manifesto  and about the recruiting  none of them had yet seen the manifesto  but they all knew it had appeared the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking  he neither smoked nor talked  but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors  whom he egged on against each other one of them was a sallow  clean shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face  already growing old  though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man  he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth  was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes  this was an old bachelor shinshin  a cousin of the countess  a man with a sharp tongue  as they said in moscow society  he seemed to be condescending to his companion the latter  a fresh  rosy officer of the guards  irreproachably washed brushed  and buttoned  held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke  letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings  this was lieutenant berg  an officer in the semenov regiment with whom boris was to travel to join the army  and about whom natasha had teased her elder sister vera  speaking of berg as her intended  the count sat between them and listened attentively  his favorite occupation when not playing boston  a card game he was very fond of  was that of listener  especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another well  then  old chap  mon tres honorable alphonse karlovich  said shinshin  laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french phrases which was a peculiarity of his speech  vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l etat   you want to make something out of your company  you expect to make an income out of the government no  peter nikolaevich  i only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry  just consider my own position now  peter nikolaevich berg always spoke quietly  politely  and with great precision  his conversation always related entirely to himself  he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself  he could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable  but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction consider my position  peter nikolaevich  were i in the cavalry i should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months  even with the rank of lieutenant  but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty  said he  looking at shinshin and the count with a joyful  pleasant smile  as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else besides that  peter nikolaevich  by exchanging into the guards i shall be in a more prominent position  continued berg  and vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards  then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles  i even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father  he went on  emitting a smoke ring la balance y est   a german knows how to skin a flint  as the proverb says  remarked shinshin  moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count  so that squares matters the count burst out laughing  the other guests seeing that shinshin was talking came up to listen  berg  oblivious of irony or indifference continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps  how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he  as senior in the company might easily succeed to the post  how popular he was with everyone in the regiment  and how satisfied his father was with him  berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this  and did not seem to suspect that others too  might have their own interests  but all he said was so prettily sedate  and the naivete of his youthful egotism was so obvious  that he disarmed his hearers well  my boy  you ll get along wherever you go foot or horse that i ll warrant  said shinshin  patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa berg smiled joyously  the count  by his guests  went into the drawing room it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests expecting the summons to zakuska   avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk  in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food  the host and hostess look toward the door  and now and then glance at one another and the visitors try to guess from these glances who  or what  they are waiting for some important relation who has not yet arrived  or a dish that is not yet ready  hors d oeuvres pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across blocking the way for everyone  the countess tried to make him talk  but he went on naively looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables  he was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact  most of the guests  knowing of the affair with the bear  looked with curiosity at this big  stout  quiet man  wondering how such a clumsy  modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman you have only lately arrived  the countess asked him oui  madame  replied he  looking around him you have not yet seen my husband non  madame  he smiled quite inappropriately you have been in paris recently  i believe  i suppose it s very interesting very interesting the countess exchanged glances with anna mikhaylovna  the latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man  and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father  but he answered her  as he had the countess  only in monosyllables  the other guests were all conversing with one another  the razumovskis  it was charming  you are very kind  countess apraksina  was heard on all sides  the countess rose and went into the ballroom marya dmitrievna  came her voice from there herself  came the answer in a rough voice  and marya dmitrievna entered the room all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose  marya dmitrievna paused at the door  tall and stout holding high her fifty year old head with its gray curls  she stood surveying the guests  and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up  marya dmitrievna always spoke in russian health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children  she said  in her loud  full toned voice which drowned all others  well  you old sinner  she went on  turning to the count who was kissing her hand  you re feeling dull in moscow  i daresay  nowhere to hunt with your dogs  but what is to be done  old man  just see how these nestlings are growing up  and she pointed to the girls  you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not well  said she  how s my cossack  marya dmitrievna always called natasha a cossack  and she stroked the child s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand  i know she s a scamp of a girl  but i like her she took a pair of pear shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and having given them to the rosy natasha  who beamed with the pleasure of her saint s day fete  turned away at once and addressed herself to pierre eh  eh  friend  come here a bit  said she  assuming a soft high tone of voice  come here  my friend  and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher  pierre approached  looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles come nearer  come nearer  friend  i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor  and in your case it s my evident duty  she paused  all were silent  expectant of what was to follow  for this was clearly only a prelude a fine lad  my word  a fine lad  his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear  for shame  sir for shame  it would be better if you went to the war she turned away and gave her hand to the count  who could hardly keep from laughing well  i suppose it is time we were at table  said marya dmitrievna the count went in first with marya dmitrievna  the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars  a man of importance to them because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment  then came anna mikhaylovna with shinshin  berg gave his arm to vera  the smiling julie karagina went in with nicholas  after them other couples followed  filling the whole dining hall  and last of all the children  tutors  and governesses followed singly  the footmen began moving about  chairs scraped  the band struck up in the gallery  and the guests settled down in their places  then the strains of the count s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks  the voices of visitors  and the soft steps of the footmen  at one end of the table sat the countess with marya dmitrievna on her right and anna mikhaylovna on her left  the other lady visitors were farther down  at the other end sat the count with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshin and the other male visitors on his right  midway down the long table on one side sat the grownup young people  vera beside berg  and pierre beside boris  and on the other side  the children  tutors  and governesses  from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases  the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light blue ribbons  and busily filled his neighbors  glasses  not neglecting his own  the countess in turn without omitting her duties as hostess  threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair  at the ladies  end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time  at the men s end the voices sounded louder and louder  especially that of the colonel of hussars who  growing more and more flushed  ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests  berg with tender smiles was saying to vera that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling  boris was telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natasha  who was sitting opposite pierre spoke little but examined the new faces  and ate a great deal  of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines  these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward  wrapped in a napkin  from behind the next man s shoulders and whispered  dry madeira  hungarian or rhine wine  as the case might be  of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count s monogram that stood before his plate  pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment  gazing with ever increasing amiability at the other guests  natasha  who sat opposite was looking at boris as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time  sometimes that same look fell on pierre  and that funny lively little girl s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why nicholas sat at some distance from sonya  beside julie karagina  to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile  sonya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy  now she turned pale  now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were saying to one another  the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children  the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes  wines and kinds of dessert  in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in germany  and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by  he frowned  trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine  but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it  but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge chapter xix at the men s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated  the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy  which he had himself seen  had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte  remarked shinshin he has stopped austria s cackle and i fear it will be our turn next the colonel was a stout  tall  plethoric german  evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian  he resented shinshin s remark it is for the reasson  my goot sir  said he  speaking with a german accent  for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat  he declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances  he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto  and the wish  which constitutes the emperor s sole and absolute aim to establish peace in europe on firm foundations has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose zat  my dear sir  is vy  he concluded  drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval connaissez vous le proverbe   jerome  jerome  do not roam  but turn spindles at home  said shinshin  puckering his brows and smiling cela nous convient a merveille  suvorov now he knew what he was about  yet they beat him a plate couture  and where are we to find suvorovs now  je vous demande un peu  said he  continually changing from french to russian do you know the proverb  that suits us down to the ground  hollow  i just ask you that ve must vight to the last tr r op of our plood  said the colonel thumping the table  and ve must tie for our emperor  and zen all vill pe vell  and ve must discuss it as little as po o ossible  he dwelt particularly on the word possible  as po o ossible  he ended  again turning to the count  zat is how ve old hussars look at it  and zere s an end of it  and how do you  a young man and a young hussar  how do you judge of it  he added  addressing nicholas  who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel i am quite of your opinion  replied nicholas  flaming up  turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer  he concluded conscious as were others after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward what you said just now was splendid  said his partner julie sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking pierre listened to the colonel s speech and nodded approvingly that s fine  said he the young man s a real hussar  shouted the colonel  again thumping the table what are you making such a noise about over there  marya dmitrievna s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table  what are you thumping the table for  she demanded of the hussar  and why are you exciting yourself  do you think the french are here i am speaking ze truce  replied the hussar with a smile it s all about the war  the count shouted down the table  you know my son s going  marya dmitrievna  my son is going i have four sons in the army but still i don t fret  it is all in god s hands  you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle replied marya dmitrievna s deep voice  which easily carried the whole length of the table that s true once more the conversations concentrated  the ladies  at the one end and the men s at the other you won t ask  natasha s little brother was saying  i know you won t ask i will  replied natasha her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution  she half rose  by a glance inviting pierre  who sat opposite  to listen to what was coming  and turning to her mother mamma  rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice audible the whole length of the table what is it  asked the countess  startled  but seeing by her daughter s face that it was only mischief  she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head the conversation was hushed mamma  what sweets are we going to have  and natasha s voice sounded still more firm and resolute the countess tried to frown  but could not  marya dmitrievna shook her fat finger cossack  she said threateningly most of the guests  uncertain how to regard this sally  looked at the elders you had better take care  said the countess mamma  what sweets are we going to have  natasha again cried boldly with saucy gaiety  confident that her prank would be taken in good part sonya and fat little petya doubled up with laughter you see  i have asked  whispered natasha to her little brother and to pierre  glancing at him again ice pudding  but you won t get any  said marya dmitrievna natasha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even marya dmitrievna marya dmitrievna  what kind of ice pudding  i don t like ice cream carrot ices no  what kind  marya dmitrievna  what kind  she almost screamed  i want to know marya dmitrievna and the countess burst out laughing  and all the guests joined in  everyone laughed  not at marya dmitrievna s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat marya dmitrievna in this fashion natasha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice  before the ices  champagne was served round  the band again struck up  the count and countess kissed  and the guests  leaving their seats  went up to congratulate  the countess  and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count  with the children  and with one another  again the footmen rushed about  chairs scraped  and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces  the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count s study chapter xx the card tables were drawn out  sets made up for boston  and the count s visitors settled themselves  some in the two drawing rooms  some in the sitting room  some in the library the count  holding his cards fanwise  kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after dinner nap  and laughed at everything  the young people  at the countess  instigation  gathered round the clavichord and harp  julie by general request played first  after she had played a little air with variations on the harp  she joined the other young ladies in begging natasha and nicholas  who were noted for their musical talent  to sing something  natasha  who was treated as though she were grown up  was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy what shall we sing  she said the brook  suggested nicholas well  then  let s be quick  boris  come here  said natasha  but where is sonya she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her running into sonya s room and not finding her there  natasha ran to the nursery  but sonya was not there either  natasha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage  the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostov household and there in fact was sonya lying face downward on nurse s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest  crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her hiding her face with her slender fingers  and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook  natasha s face  which had been so radiantly happy all that saint s day  suddenly changed  her eyes became fixed  and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped sonya  what is it  what is the matter  oo  oo  oo  and natasha s large mouth widened  making her look quite ugly  and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why  except that sonya was crying sonya tried to lift her head to answer but could not  and hid her face still deeper in the bed  natasha wept  sitting on the blue striped feather bed and hugging her friend  with an effort sonya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining nicholas is going away in a week s time  his  papers  have come he told me himself  but still i should not cry  and she showed a paper she held in her hand with the verses nicholas had written still  i should not cry  but you can t  no one can understand  what a soul he has and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul it s all very well for you  i am not envious  i love you and boris also  she went on  gaining a little strength  he is nice  there are no difficulties in your way  but nicholas is my cousin  one would have to  the metropolitan himself  and even then it can t be done and besides  if she tells mamma  sonya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so  that i am spoiling nicholas  career and am heartless and ungrateful  while truly  god is my witness  and she made the sign of the cross  i love her so much  and all of you  only vera  and what for  what have i done to her  i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything  only i have nothing sonya could not continue  and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed  natasha began consoling her  but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend s trouble sonya  she suddenly exclaimed  as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend s sorrow  i m sure vera has said something to you since dinner  hasn t she yes  these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others  and she found them on my table and said she d show them to mamma  and that i was ungrateful  and that mamma would never allow him to marry me  but that he ll marry julie  you see how he s been with her all day natasha  what have i done to deserve it and again she began to sob  more bitterly than before  natasha lifted her up  hugged her  and  smiling through her tears  began comforting her sonya  don t believe her  darling  don t believe her  do you remember how we and nicholas  all three of us  talked in the sitting room after supper  why  we settled how everything was to be  i don t quite remember how  but don t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was  there s uncle shinshin s brother has married his first cousin  and we are only second cousins  you know  and boris says it is quite possible  you know i have told him all about it  and he is so clever and so good  said natasha  don t you cry  sonya  dear love darling sonya  and she kissed her and laughed  vera s spiteful  never mind her  and all will come right and she won t say anything to mamma nicholas will tell her himself  and he doesn t care at all for julie natasha kissed her on the hair sonya sat up  the little kitten brightened  its eyes shone  and it seemed ready to lift its tail  jump down on its soft paws  and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should do you think so  really  truly  she said  quickly smoothing her frock and hair really  truly  answered natasha  pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend s plaits both laughed well  let s go and sing the brook come along do you know  that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny  said natasha  stopping suddenly  i feel so happy and she set off at a run along the passage sonya  shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest  ran after natasha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light  joyous steps  at the visitors  request the young people sang the quartette  the brook  with which everyone was delighted  then nicholas sang a song he had just learned at nighttime in the moon s fair glow how sweet  as fancies wander free to feel that in this world there s one who still is thinking but of thee that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music o er the lea it is for thee thus swells her heart  sighing its message out to thee a day or two  then bliss unspoilt  but oh  till then i cannot live he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall  and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinshin had engaged him as a man recently returned from abroad  in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre  when the music began natasha came in and walking straight up to pierre said  laughing and blushing mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers i am afraid of mixing the figures  pierre replied  but if you will be my teacher  and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up pierre sat down with his little partner  natasha was perfectly happy she was dancing with a grown up man  who had been abroad  she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown up lady she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where she had learned it  she talked with her partner  fanning herself and smiling over the fan dear  dear  just look at her  exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom  pointing to natasha natasha blushed and laughed well  really  mamma  why should you  what is there to be surprised at in the midst of the third ecossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and marya dmitrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors  they now  stretching themselves after sitting so long  and replacing their purses and pocketbooks  entered the ballroom  first came marya dmitrievna and the count  both with merry countenances  the count with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style  offered his bent arm to marya dmitrievna  he drew himself up  a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the ecossaise was ended he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery addressing the first violin semen  do you know the daniel cooper this was the count s favorite dance  which he had danced in his youth strictly speaking  daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise look at papa  shouted natasha to the whole company  and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman  who standing beside his tall and stout partner marya dmitrievna  curved his arms  beat time  straightened his shoulders  turned out his toes  tapped gently with his foot  and  by a smile that broadened his round face more and more  prepared the onlookers for what was to follow  as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance  began to sound  all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs the men on one side and the women on the other who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry just look at the master  a regular eagle he is  loudly remarked the nurse  as she stood in one of the doorways the count danced well and knew it  but his partner could not and did not want to dance well  her enormous figure stood erect  her powerful arms hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess  and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance  what was expressed by the whole of the count s plump figure  in marya dmitrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose but if the count  getting more and more into the swing of it  charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet  marya dmitrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning  or stamp her foot which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity the dance grew livelier and livelier  the other couples could not attract a moment s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so  all were watching the count and marya dmitrievna  natasha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress  urging them to look at papa though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple  in the intervals of the dance the count  breathing deeply  waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster  faster  faster  and faster  lightly  more lightly  and yet more lightly whirled the count  flying round marya dmitrievna  now on his toes  now on his heels  until  turning his partner round to her seat  he executed the final pas  raising his soft foot backwards  bowing his perspiring head  smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm  amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natasha  both partners stood still  breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs that s how we used to dance in our time  ma chere  said the count that was a daniel cooper  exclaimed marya dmitrievna  tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily chapter xxi while in the rostovs  ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced  to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered  and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper  count bezukhov had a sixth stroke  the doctors pronounced recovery impossible  after a mute confession communion was administered to the dying man  preparations made for the sacrament of unction  and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments  outside the house  beyond the gates a group of undertakers  who hid whenever a carriage drove up  waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral  the military governor of moscow  who had been assiduous in sending aides de camp to inquire after the count s health  came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherine s court  count bezukhov the magnificent reception room was crowded  everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor  having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man  passed out  slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors  clergy  and relatives of the family  prince vasili  who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days escorted him to the door  repeating something to him several times in low tones when the military governor had gone  prince vasili sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom  crossing one leg high over the other  leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand  after sitting so for a while he rose  and  looking about him with frightened eyes went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house  to the room of the eldest princess those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers  and  whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man s room  grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door  which creaked slightly when opened the limits of human life  are fixed and may not be o erpassed  said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naively to his words i wonder  is it not too late to administer unction  asked the lady adding the priest s clerical title  as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject ah  madam  it is a great sacrament  replied the priest  passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head who was that  the military governor himself  was being asked at the other side of the room  how young looking he is yes  and he is over sixty  i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone  they wished to administer the sacrament of unction i knew someone who received that sacrament seven times the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside dr  lorrain  who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of catherine  leaning his elbow on a table beautiful  said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather the weather is beautiful  princess  and besides  in moscow one feels as if one were in the country yes  indeed  replied the princess with a sigh  so he may have something to drink lorrain considered has he taken his medicine yes the doctor glanced at his watch take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar  and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch dere has neffer been a gase  a german doctor was saying to an aide de camp  dat one liffs after de sird stroke and what a well preserved man he was  remarked the aide de camp  and who will inherit his wealth  he added in a whisper it von t go begging  replied the german with a smile everyone again looked toward the door  which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to lorrain s instructions  the german doctor went up to lorrain do you think he can last till morning  asked the german  addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly lorrain  pursing up his lips  waved a severely negative finger before his nose tonight  not later  said he in a low voice  and he moved away with a decorous smile of self satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient s condition meanwhile prince vasili had opened the door into the princess  room in this room it was almost dark  only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture  whatnots cupboards  and little tables  the quilt of a high  white feather bed was just visible behind a screen  a small dog began to bark ah  is it you  cousin she rose and smoothed her hair  which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish has anything happened  she asked  i am so terrified no  there is no change  i only came to have a talk about business catiche   muttered the prince  seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated  you have made the place warm  i must say  he remarked  well  sit down  let s have a talk catherine i thought perhaps something had happened  she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression  and  sitting down opposite the prince  she prepared to listen i wished to get a nap  mon cousin  but i can t well  my dear  said prince vasili  taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit it was plain that this well  referred to much that they both understood without naming the princess  who had a straight  rigid body  abnormally long for her legs  looked directly at prince vasili with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes  then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh  this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion  or of weariness and hope of resting before long  prince vasili understood it as an expression of weariness and i  he said  do you think it is easier for me  i am as worn out as a post horse  but still i must have a talk with you  catiche  a very serious talk prince vasili said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously  now on one side  now on the other  giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room  his eyes too seemed strange  at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm the princess  holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands  looked attentively into prince vasili s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence  if she had to wait till morning well  you see  my dear princess and cousin  catherine semenovna continued prince vasili  returning to his theme  apparently not without an inner struggle  at such a moment as this one must think of everything  one must think of the future  of all of you  i love you all  like children of my own  as you know the princess continued to look at him without moving  and with the same dull expression and then of course my family has also to be considered  prince vasili went on  testily pushing away a little table without looking at her you know  catiche  that we you three sisters  mamontov  and my wife are the count s only direct heirs  i know  i know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters  it is no easier for me  but  my dear i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything  do you know i have sent for pierre  the count  pointing to his portrait definitely demanded that he should be called prince vasili looked questioningly at the princess  but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant  mon cousin  she replied  and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this yes  yes  of course  interrupted prince vasili impatiently  rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away  but  in short  the fact is  you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property  not to us his direct heirs  but to pierre he has made wills enough  quietly remarked the princess  but he cannot leave the estate to pierre  pierre is illegitimate but  my dear  said prince vasili suddenly  clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly  what if a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierre s legitimation  do you understand that in consideration of the count s services  his request would be granted the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with i can tell you more  continued prince vasili  seizing her hand  that letter was written  though it was not sent  and the emperor knew of it the only question is  has it been destroyed or not  if not  then as soon as all is over  and prince vasili sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over  and the count s papers are opened  the will and letter will be delivered to the emperor  and the petition will certainly be granted  pierre will get everything as the legitimate son and our share  asked the princess smiling ironically  as if anything might happen  only not that but  my poor catiche  it is as clear as daylight  he will then be the legal heir to everything and you won t get anything  you must know  my dear  whether the will and letter were written  and whether they have been destroyed or not  and if they have somehow been overlooked  you ought to know where they are  and must find them  because what next  the princess interrupted  smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes  i am a woman  and you think we are all stupid  but i know this  an illegitimate son cannot inherit  un batard   she added  as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasili the invalidity of his contention  a bastard well  really  catiche  can t you understand  you are so intelligent how is it you don t see that if the count has written a letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate  it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezukhov  and will then inherit everything under the will  and if the will and letter are not destroyed  then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s ensuit   that s certain  and all that follows therefrom i know the will was made  but i also know that it is invalid  and you mon cousin  seem to consider me a perfect fool  said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging my dear princess catherine semenovna  began prince vasili impatiently i came here not to wrangle with you  but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman  a good  kind  true relation  and i tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierre s favor are among the count s papers  then  my dear girl  you and your sisters are not heiresses  if you don t believe me  then believe an expert  i have just been talking to dmitri onufrich  the family solicitor  and he says the same at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess  ideas  her thin lips grew white  though her eyes did not change  and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect that would be a fine thing  said she  i never wanted anything and i don t now she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress and this is gratitude this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake  she cried  it s splendid  fine  i don t want anything  prince yes  but you are not the only one  there are your sisters  replied prince vasili but the princess did not listen to him yes  i knew it long ago but had forgotten  i knew that i could expect nothing but meanness  deceit  envy  intrigue  and ingratitude the blackest ingratitude in this house do you or do you not know where that will is  insisted prince vasili his cheeks twitching more than ever yes  i was a fool  i still believed in people  loved them  and sacrificed myself  but only the base  the vile succeed  i know who has been intriguing the princess wished to rise  but the prince held her by the hand  she had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race she gave her companion an angry glance there is still time  my dear  you must remember  catiche  that it was all done casually in a moment of anger  of illness  and was afterwards forgotten  our duty  my dear  is to rectify his mistake  to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice  and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who who sacrificed everything for him  chimed in the princess  who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast  though he never could appreciate it  no  mon cousin  she added with a sigh  i shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward  that in this world there is neither honor nor justice  in this world one has to be cunning and cruel now come  come  be reasonable  i know your excellent heart no  i have a wicked heart i know your heart  repeated the prince  i value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me  don t upset yourself  and let us talk sensibly while there is still time  be it a day or be it but an hour  tell me all you know about the will  and above all where it is you must know  we will take it at once and show it to the count  he has no doubt  forgotten it and will wish to destroy it  you understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes  that is my only reason for being here  i came simply to help him and you now i see it all  i know who has been intriguing i know  cried the princess that s not the point  my dear it s that protege of yours  that sweet princess drubetskaya  that anna mikhaylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid  the infamous  vile woman do not let us lose any time ah  don t talk to me  last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile  disgraceful things about us  especially about sophie i can t repeat them that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight  i know it was then he wrote this vile  infamous paper  but i thought the thing was invalid we ve got to it at last why did you not tell me about it sooner it s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow  said the princess  ignoring his question  now i know  yes  if i have a sin  a great sin  it is hatred of that vile woman  almost shrieked the princess  now quite changed  and what does she come worming herself in here for  but i will give her a piece of my mind  the time will come chapter xxii while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess  room  a carriage containing pierre who had been sent for  and anna mikhaylovna who found it necessary to accompany him  was driving into the court of count bezukhov s house  as the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows  anna mikhaylovna  having turned with words of comfort to her companion  realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up  rousing himself  pierre followed anna mikhaylovna out of the carriage  and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him  he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door  while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men  who looked like tradespeople  ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall  pausing for a moment  pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides  but neither anna mikhaylovna nor the footman nor the coachman  who could not help seeing these people  took any notice of them  it seems to be all right  pierre concluded  and followed anna mikhaylovna  she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase  calling to pierre  who was lagging behind  to follow  though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all  still less why he had to go by the back stairs  yet judging by anna mikhaylovna s air of assurance and haste  pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who carrying pails  came running downstairs  their boots clattering  these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikhaylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there is this the way to the princesses  apartments  asked anna mikhaylovna of one of them yes  replied a footman in a bold loud voice  as if anything were now permissible  the door to the left  ma am perhaps the count did not ask for me  said pierre when he reached the landing  i d better go to my own room anna mikhaylovna paused and waited for him to come up ah  my friend  she said  touching his arm as she had done her son s when speaking to him that afternoon  believe me i suffer no less than you do  but be a man but really  hadn t i better go away  he asked  looking kindly at her over his spectacles ah  my dear friend  forget the wrongs that may have been done you think that he is your father  perhaps in the agony of death  she sighed  i have loved you like a son from the first  trust yourself to me  pierre  i shall not forget your interests pierre did not understand a word  but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger  and he meekly followed anna mikhaylovna who was already opening a door this door led into a back anteroom  an old man  a servant of the princesses  sat in a corner knitting a stocking  pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms  anna mikhaylovna  addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear  and my sweet  asked about the princess  health and then led pierre along a stone passage  the first door on the left led into the princesses  apartments  the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house was done in haste at that time  and pierre and anna mikhaylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room  where prince vasili and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking  seeing them pass prince vasili drew back with obvious impatience  while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince vasili s face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide  anna mikhaylovna evinced no surprise  she only smiled faintly and sighed  as if to say that this was no more than she had expected be a man  my friend  i will look after your interests  said she in reply to his look  and went still faster along the passage pierre could not make out what it was all about  and still less what watching over his interests  meant  but he decided that all these things had to be  from the passage they went into a large  dimly lit room adjoining the count s reception room  it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach  but even in this room there now stood an empty bath  and water had been spilled on the carpet  they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them  they went into the reception room familiar to pierre  with two italian windows opening into the conservatory  with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine the great  the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before  whispering to one another  all became silent and turned to look at the pale tear worn anna mikhaylovna as she entered  and at the big stout figure of pierre who  hanging his head meekly followed her anna mikhaylovna s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived  with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now keeping pierre close beside her  entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon  she felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see  her own admission was assured  casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count s confessor there  she glided up to him with a sort of amble  not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller  and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest god be thanked that you are in time  said she to one of the priests all we relatives have been in such anxiety  this young man is the count s son  she added more softly  what a terrible moment having said this she went up to the doctor dear doctor  said she  this young man is the count s son  is there any hope the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders  anna mikhaylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes  almost closing the latter  sighed  and moved away from the doctor to pierre  to him  in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice  she said trust in his mercy  and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her  she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it pierre  having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly  moved toward the sofa she had indicated  as soon as anna mikhaylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy  he noticed that they whispered to one another  casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility  a deference such as he had never before received was shown him  a strange lady  the one who had been talking to the priests  rose and offered him her seat  an aide de camp picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped  the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by  and moved to make way for him  at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady  and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way  but all at once he felt that this would not do  and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him  and that he was therefore bound to accept their services  he took the glove in silence from the aide de camp  and sat down in the lady s chair  placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naive attitude of an egyptian statue and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be  and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight  but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him not two minutes had passed before prince vasili with head erect majestically entered the room  he was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast  he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre  he went up to him  took his hand a thing he never used to do and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on courage  courage  my friend  he has asked to see you  that is well and he turned to go but pierre thought it necessary to ask  how is  and hesitated  not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count yet ashamed to call him father he had another stroke about half an hour ago  courage  my friend pierre s mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke suggested to him a blow from something  he looked at prince vasili in perplexity  and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness  prince vasili said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe  he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step  the eldest princess followed him  and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about  and at last anna mikhaylovna  still with the same expression  pale but resolute in the discharge of duty  ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said the divine mercy is inexhaustible  unction is about to be administered come pierre went in at the door  stepping on the soft carpet  and noticed that the strange lady  the aide de camp  and some of the servants  all followed him in  as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room chapter xxiii pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch  its walls hung round with persian carpets  the part of the room behind the columns  with a high silk curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons  was brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service  under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair  and in that chair on snowy white smooth pillows  evidently freshly changed  pierre saw covered to the waist by a bright green quilt the familiar  majestic figure of his father  count bezukhov  with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion  and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome  ruddy face  he lay just under the icons his large thick hands outside the quilt  into the right hand  which was lying palm downwards  a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb  and an old servant  bending over from behind the chair  held it in position  by the chair stood the priests  their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments  with lighted tapers in their hands  slowly and solemnly conducting the service  a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes  and just in front of them their eldest sister  catiche  with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons  as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round  anna mikhaylovna  with a meek  sorrowful  and all forgiving expression on her face  stood by the door near the strange lady  prince vasili in front of the door  near the invalid chair  a wax taper in his left hand  was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose  and was crossing himself with his right hand  turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god if you do not understand these sentiments  he seemed to be saying  so much the worse for you behind him stood the aide de camp  the doctors  and the menservants  the men and women had separated as in church  all were silently crossing themselves  and the reading of the church service  the subdued chanting of deep bass voices  and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard  anna mikhaylovna  with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about  went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a taper  he lit it and  distracted by observing those around him  began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper sophie  the rosy  laughter loving  youngest princess with the mole watched him  she smiled  hid her face in her handkerchief  and remained with it hidden for awhile  then looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh  she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing  but could not resist looking at him  so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns  in the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased  they whispered to one another  and the old servant who was holding the count s hand got up and said something to the ladies  anna mikhaylovna stepped forward and  stooping over the dying man  beckoned to lorrain from behind her back  the french doctor held no taper  he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he  a foreigner  in spite of all differences of faith  understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it  he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life  with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free  and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment  the sick man was given something to drink  there was a stir around him  then the people resumed their places and the service continued  during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasili left the chair on which he had been leaning  and with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them did not go up to the dying man  but passed by him  joined the eldest princess  and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings  on leaving the bed both prince vasili and the princess passed out by a back door  but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on  having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential the chanting of the service ceased  and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament  the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before  around him everyone began to stir  steps were audible and whispers  among which anna mikhaylovna s was the most distinct pierre heard her say certainly he must be moved onto the bed  here it will be impossible the sick man was so surrounded by doctors  princesses  and servants that pierre could no longer see the reddish yellow face with its gray mane which  though he saw other faces as well  he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service  he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him catch hold of my arm or you ll drop him  he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper  catch hold from underneath  here exclaimed different voices  and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried  as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them as the bearers  among whom was anna mikhaylovna  passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man s high  stout  uncovered chest and powerful shoulders  raised by those who were holding him under the armpits  and of his gray  curly leonine head  this head  with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones its handsome  sensual mouth  and its cold  majestic expression  was not disfigured by the approach of death  it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before  when the count had sent him to petersburg  but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers  and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing after a few minutes  bustle beside the high bedstead  those who had carried the sick man dispersed  anna mikhaylovna touched pierre s hand and said  come  pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed  he lay with his head propped high on the pillows  his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt  the palms downward when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him  but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere  or it meant too much  pierre hesitated  not knowing what to do  and glanced inquiringly at his guide  anna mikhaylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes  glancing at the sick man s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss  pierre  carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt  followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned  fleshy hand  neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count s face stirred  once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikhaylovna to see what he was to do next  anna mikhaylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed pierre obediently sat down  his eyes asking if he were doing right  anna mikhaylovna nodded approvingly  again pierre fell into the naively symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue  evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible  he looked at the count  who still gazed at the spot where pierre s face had been before he sat down  anna mikhaylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son  this lasted about two minutes  which to pierre seemed an hour  suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count s face began to twitch  the twitching increased  the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did pierre realize how near death his father was  and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct  hoarse sound  anna mikhaylovna looked attentively at the sick man s eyes  trying to guess what he wanted  she pointed first to pierre  then to some drink  then named prince vasili in an inquiring whisper  then pointed to the quilt  the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience  he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed wants to turn on the other side  whispered the servant  and got up to turn the count s heavy body toward the wall pierre rose to help him while the count was being turned over  one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward  whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain  at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm  at pierre s terror stricken face and again at the arm  and on his face a feeble  piteous smile appeared quite out of keeping with his features  that seemed to deride his own helplessness  at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose  and tears dimmed his eyes  the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall  he sighed he is dozing  said anna mikhaylovna  observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching  let us go pierre went out chapter xxiv there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasili and the eldest princess  who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the great and talking eagerly  as soon as they saw pierre and his companion they became silent  and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered i can t bear the sight of that woman catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room  said prince vasili to anna mikhaylovna  go and take something  my poor anna mikhaylovna  or you will not hold out to pierre he said nothing  merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder  pierre went with anna mikhaylovna into the small drawing room there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian tea  lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room  around the table all who were at count bezukhov s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves  pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables during balls given at the house pierre  who did not know how to dance had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who  as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders  looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times  now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles  on one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder  and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there  not merrymaking  but somberly whispering  and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom  pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to  he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince vasili and the eldest princess  pierre concluded that this also was essential  and after a short interval followed her  anna mikhaylovna was standing beside the princess  and they were both speaking in excited whispers permit me  princess  to know what is necessary and what is not necessary  said the younger of the two speakers  evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room but  my dear princess  answered anna mikhaylovna blandly but impressively  blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing  won t this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs repose  worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared prince vasili was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude  with one leg crossed high above the other  his cheeks  which were so flabby that they looked heavier below  were twitching violently  but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying come  my dear anna mikhaylovna  let catiche do as she pleases  you know how fond the count is of her i don t even know what is in this paper  said the younger of the two ladies  addressing prince vasili and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand  all i know is that his real will is in his writing table  and this is a paper he has forgotten she tried to pass anna mikhaylovna  but the latter sprang so as to bar her path i know  my dear  kind princess  said anna mikhaylovna  seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily  dear princess  i beg and implore you  have some pity on him  je vous en conjure the princess did not reply  their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible  but it was evident that if the princess did speak  her words would not be flattering to anna mikhaylovna  though the latter held on tenaciously  her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness pierre  my dear  come here  i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation  is it not so  prince why don t you speak  cousin  suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled  why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere  making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man s room  intriguer  she hissed viciously  and tugged with all her might at the portfolio but anna mikhaylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio  and changed her grip prince vasili rose  oh  said he with reproach and surprise  this is absurd  come  let go i tell you the princess let go and you too but anna mikhaylovna did not obey him let go  i tell you  i will take the responsibility  i myself will go and ask him  i  does that satisfy you but  prince  said anna mikhaylovna  after such a solemn sacrament allow him a moment s peace  here  pierre  tell them your opinion  said she  turning to the young man who  having come quite close  was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity  and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasili remember that you will answer for the consequences  said prince vasili severely  you don t know what you are doing vile woman  shouted the princess  darting unexpectedly at anna mikhaylovna and snatching the portfolio from her prince vasili bent his head and spread out his hands at this moment that terrible door  which pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly  burst noisily open and banged against the wall  and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands what are you doing  she cried vehemently  he is dying and you leave me alone with him her sister dropped the portfolio  anna mikhaylovna  stooping  quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom  the eldest princess and prince vasili  recovering themselves  followed her  a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face  again biting her underlip  at sight of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred yes  now you may be glad  said she  this is what you have been waiting for  and bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room prince vasili came next  he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it  covering his face with his hand  pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague ah  my friend  said he  taking pierre by the elbow  and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it before  how often we sin  how much we deceive  and all for what  i am near sixty  dear friend  i too  all will end in death  all  death is awful  and he burst into tears anna mikhaylovna came out last  she approached pierre with slow  quiet steps pierre  she said pierre gave her an inquiring look  she kissed the young man on his forehead  wetting him with her tears  then after a pause she said he is no more pierre looked at her over his spectacles come  i will go with you  try to weep  nothing gives such relief as tears she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see his face  anna mikhaylovna left him  and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm in the morning anna mikhaylovna said to pierre yes  my dear  this is a great loss for us all  not to speak of you  but god will support you  you are young  and are now  i hope  in command of an immense fortune  the will has not yet been opened  i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head  but it imposes duties on you  and you must be a man pierre was silent perhaps later on i may tell you  my dear boy  that if i had not been there  god only knows what would have happened  you know  uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget boris  but he had no time  i hope  my dear friend  you will carry out your father s wish pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikhaylovna  after her talk with pierre  anna mikhaylovna returned to the rostovs  and went to bed  on waking in the morning she told the rostovs and all her acquaintances the details of count bezukhov s death  she said the count had died as she would herself wish to die  that his end was not only touching but edifying  as to the last meeting between father and son  it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears  and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son  or pierre  whom it had been pitiful to see  so stricken was he with grief though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father it is painful  but it does one good  it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son  said she  of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vasili she spoke disapprovingly  but in whispers and as a great secret chapter xxv at bald hills  prince nicholas andreevich bolkonski s estate  the arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected  but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince s household  general in chief prince nicholas andreevich nicknamed in society  the king of prussia  ever since the emperor paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter  princess mary  and her companion  mademoiselle bourienne  though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals  he still continued to live in the country  remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to bald hills  while he himself needed no one and nothing  he used to say that there are only two sources of human vice idleness and superstition  and only two virtues activity and intelligence  he himself undertook his daughter s education  and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty  and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied  he was himself always occupied  writing his memoirs  solving problems in higher mathematics  turning snuffboxes on a lathe  working in the garden  or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate  as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude  he always came to table under precisely the same conditions and not only at the same hour but at the same minute  with those about him  from his daughter to his serfs  the prince was sharp and invariably exacting  so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused  although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs  every high official appointed to the province in which the prince s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect  gardener  or princess mary did  till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour  everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man  with powdered wig  small withered hands  and bushy gray eyebrows which  when he frowned  sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd youthfully glittering eyes on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive  princess mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting  crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer  every morning she came in like that  and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper  please walk in through the door came the regular hum of a lathe  the princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily  she paused at the entrance  the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use  the large table covered with books and plans  the tall glass fronted bookcases with keys in the locks  the high desk for writing while standing up  on which lay an open exercise book  and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around all indicated continuous  varied  and orderly activity  the motion of the small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver  and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand  showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age  after a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal  wiped his chisel dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe  and  approaching the table  summoned his daughter  he never gave his children a blessing so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven  and  regarding her tenderly and attentively  said severely quite well  all right then  sit down  he took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot for tomorrow  said he  quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail the princess bent over the exercise book on the table wait a bit  here s a letter for you  said the old man suddenly  taking a letter addressed in a woman s hand from a bag hanging above the table onto which he threw it at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess  face  she took it quickly and bent her head over it from heloise  asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound  yellowish teeth yes  it s from julie  replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile i ll let two more letters pass  but the third i ll read  said the prince sternly  i m afraid you write much nonsense  i ll read the third read this if you like  father  said the princess  blushing still more and holding out the letter the third  i said the third  cried the prince abruptly  pushing the letter away  and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures well  madam  he began  stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat  so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco  which she had known so long  now  madam  these triangles are equal  please note that the angle abc the princess looked in a scared way at her father s eyes glittering close to her  the red patches on her face came and went  and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father s further explanations  however clear they might be  whether it was the teacher s fault or the pupil s  this same thing happened every day  the princess eyes grew dim  she could not see and could not hear anything  but was only conscious of her stern father s withered face close to her  of his breath and the smell of him  and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace  the old man was beside himself  moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward  made efforts to control himself and not become vehement  but almost always did become vehement  scolded  and sometimes flung the exercise book away the princess gave a wrong answer well now  isn t she a fool  shouted the prince  pushing the book aside and turning sharply away  but rising immediately  he paced up and down lightly touched his daughter s hair and sat down again he drew up his chair  and continued to explain this won t do  princess  it won t do  said he  when princess mary having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day s lesson was about to leave  mathematics are most important  madam  i don t want to have you like our silly ladies  get used to it and you ll like it and he patted her cheek  it will drive all the nonsense out of your head she turned to go  but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your heloise has sent you  religious  i don t interfere with anyone s belief  i have looked at it  take it  well  now go  go he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her princess mary went back to her room with the sad  scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain  sickly face yet plainer  she sat down at her writing table  on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers  the princess was as untidy as her father was tidy  she put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter  it was from her most intimate friend from childhood  that same julie karagina who had been at the rostovs  name day party julie wrote in french dear and precious friend  how terrible and frightful a thing is separation  though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you  and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds  my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted  why are we not together as we were last summer  in your big study  on the blue sofa  the confidential sofa  why cannot i now  as three months ago  draw fresh moral strength from your look  so gentle calm  and penetrating  a look i loved so well and seem to see before me as i write having read thus far  princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right  it reflected a weak  ungraceful figure and thin face  her eyes  always sad  now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass  she flatters me  thought the princess turning away and continuing to read  but julie did not flatter her friend  the princess  eyes large  deep and luminous it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty  but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes the look they had when she was not thinking of herself  as with everyone  her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass  she went on reading all moscow talks of nothing but war  one of my two brothers is already abroad  the other is with the guards  who are starting on their march to the frontier  our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war  god grant that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty  in his goodness  to give us as sovereign  to say nothing of my brothers  this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart  i mean young nicholas rostov  who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army  i will confess to you  dear mary  that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me  this young man  of whom i spoke to you last summer  is so noble minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and  particularly he is so frank and has so much heart  he is so pure and poetic that my relations with him  transient as they were  have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart  which has already suffered so much someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then that is still too fresh  ah  dear friend  you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows  you are fortunate  for the latter are generally the stronger  i know very well that count nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend  but this sweet friendship this poetic and pure intimacy  were what my heart needed  but enough of this  the chief news  about which all moscow gossips  is the death of old count bezukhov  and his inheritance  fancy  the three princesses have received very little  prince vasili nothing  and it is monsieur pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate  so that he is now count bezukhov and possessor of the finest fortune in russia  it is rumored that prince vasili played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance  but i do know that since this young man  whom we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre  has become count bezukhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia  i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters  and of the young ladies themselves  toward him though  between you and me  he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow  as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me most of whom i don t even know  the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess bezukhova  but you will understand that i have no desire for the post  a propos of marriages  do you know that a while ago that universal auntie anna mikhaylovna told me  under the seal of strict secrecy  of a plan of marriage for you  it is neither more nor less than with prince vasili s son anatole  whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguee  and it is on you that his relations  choice has fallen i don t know what you will think of it  but i consider it my duty to let you know of it  he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace  that is all i have been able to find out about him but enough of gossip  i am at the end of my second sheet of paper  and mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apraksins  read the mystical book i am sending you  it has an enormous success here  though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp  it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul  adieu  give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle bourienne  i embrace you as i love you julie p s  let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed  then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table  she took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it  this is the reply she wrote also in french dear and precious friend  your letter of the th has given me great delight  so you still love me  my romantic julie  separation  of which you say so much that is bad  does not seem to have had its usual effect on you  you complain of our separation  what then should i say  if i dared complain  i who am deprived of all who are dear to me  ah  if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad  why do you suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young man  on such matters i am only severe with myself  i understand such feelings in others  and if never having felt them i cannot approve of them  neither do i condemn them  only it seems to me that christian love  love of one s neighbor  love of one s enemy  is worthier  sweeter and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself the news of count bezukhov s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it  he says the count was the last representative but one of the great century  and that it is his own turn now  but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible  god preserve us from that terrible misfortune i cannot agree with you about pierre  whom i knew as a child  he always seemed to me to have an excellent heart  and that is the quality i value most in people  as to his inheritance and the part played by prince vasili  it is very sad for both  ah  my dear friend  our divine saviour s words  that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god  are terribly true  i pity prince vasili but am still more sorry for pierre  so young and burdened with such riches to what temptations he will be exposed if i were asked what i desire most on earth  it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar  a thousand thanks  dear friend  for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow  yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp  it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination  giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity  let us rather read the epistles and gospels  let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for how can we  miserable sinners that we are  know the terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal  let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has left for our guidance here below  let us try to conform to them and follow them  and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam  the better we shall please god  who rejects all knowledge that does not come from him  and the less we seek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us  the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit my father has not spoken to me of a suitor  but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasili  in regard to this project of marriage for me  i will tell you  dear sweet friend  that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform  however painful it may be to me  should the almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i can  without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he may give me for husband i have had a letter from my brother  who announces his speedy arrival at bald hills with his wife  this pleasure will be but a brief one however  for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn  god knows how or why  not only where you are at the heart of affairs and of the world is the talk all of war even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country rumors of war are heard and painfully felt  my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches  things of which i understand nothing  and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene  it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army  you should have seen the state of the mothers  wives  and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs  it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour  who preached love and forgiveness of injuries and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another adieu  dear and kind friend  may our divine saviour and his most holy mother keep you in their holy and all powerful care mary ah  you are sending off a letter  princess  i have already dispatched mine  i have written to my poor mother  said the smiling mademoiselle bourienne rapidly  in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r s she brought into princess mary s strenuous  mournful  and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere  careless  lighthearted  and self satisfied princess  i must warn you  she added  lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure  and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement  the prince has been scolding michael ivanovich  he is in a very bad humor  very morose  be prepared ah  dear friend  replied princess mary  i have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in  i do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so the princess glanced at her watch and  seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord  went into the sitting room with a look of alarm  between twelve and two o clock  as the day was mapped out  the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord chapter xxvi the gray haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince  who was in his large study  from the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages twenty times repeated of a sonata by dussek just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch  prince andrew got out of the carriage  helped his little wife to alight  and let her pass into the house before him  old tikhon  wearing a wig  put his head out of the door of the antechamber  reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping  and hastily closed the door tikhon knew that neither the son s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day  prince andrew apparently knew this as well as tikhon  he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father s habits had changed since he was at home last  and  having assured himself that they had not  he turned to his wife he will get up in twenty minutes  let us go across to mary s room  he said the little princess had grown stouter during this time  but her eyes and her short  downy  smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever why  this is a palace  she said to her husband  looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball  let s come  quick  quick  and with a glance round  she smiled at tikhon  at her husband  and at the footman who accompanied them is that mary practicing  let s go quietly and take her by surprise prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression you ve grown older  tikhon  he said in passing to the old man  who kissed his hand before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came  the pretty  fair haired frenchwoman  mademoiselle bourienne rushed out apparently beside herself with delight ah  what joy for the princess  exclaimed she  at last  i must let her know no  no  please not  you are mademoiselle bourienne  said the little princess  kissing her  i know you already through my sister in law s friendship for you  she was not expecting us they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft repeated passage of the sonata  prince andrew stopped and made a grimace  as if expecting something unpleasant the little princess entered the room  the passage broke off in the middle  a cry was heard  then princess mary s heavy tread and the sound of kissing  when prince andrew went in the two princesses  who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding  were in each other s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch  mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart  with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh  prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned  as lovers of music do when they hear a false note  the two women let go of one another  and then  as if afraid of being too late  seized each other s hands  kissing them and pulling them away  and again began kissing each other on the face  and then to prince andrew s surprise both began to cry and kissed again  mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry  prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease  but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry  and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting ah  my dear  ah  mary  they suddenly exclaimed  and then laughed i dreamed last night you were not expecting us  ah  mary you have got thinner  and you have grown stouter i knew the princess at once  put in mademoiselle bourienne and i had no idea  exclaimed princess mary  ah  andrew  i did not see you prince andrew and his sister  hand in hand  kissed one another  and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever  princess mary had turned toward her brother  and through her tears the loving  warm gentle look of her large luminous eyes  very beautiful at that moment rested on prince andrew s face the little princess talked incessantly  her short  downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes  she told of an accident they had had on the spasski hill which might have been serious for her in her condition  and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here  and that andrew had quite changed  and that kitty odyntsova had married an old man  and that there was a suitor for mary a real one  but that they would talk of that later  princess mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness  it was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister in law s words  in the midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother so you are really going to the war  andrew  she said sighing lise sighed too yes  and even tomorrow  replied her brother he is leaving me here  god knows why  when he might have had promotion princess mary did not listen to the end  but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister in law with a tender glance at her figure is it certain  she said the face of the little princess changed  she sighed and said  yes quite certain  ah  it is very dreadful her lip descended  she brought her face close to her sister in law s and unexpectedly again began to cry she needs rest  said prince andrew with a frown  don t you  lise take her to your room and i ll go to father  how is he  just the same yes  just the same  though i don t know what your opinion will be answered the princess joyfully and are the hours the same  and the walks in the avenues  and the lathe  asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that  in spite of all his love and respect for his father  he was aware of his weaknesses the hours are the same  and the lathe  and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons  said princess mary gleefully  as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up  tikhon came to call the young prince to his father the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son s arrival  he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner  the old prince always dressed in old fashioned style  wearing an antique coat and powdered hair  and when prince andrew entered his father s dressing room not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms  but with the animated face with which he talked to pierre  the old man was sitting on a large leather covered chair  wrapped in a powdering mantle  entrusting his head to tikhon ah  here s the warrior  wants to vanquish buonaparte  said the old man  shaking his powdered head as much as the tail  which tikhon was holding fast to plait  would allow you at least must tackle him properly  or else if he goes on like this he ll soon have us  too  for his subjects  how are you  and he held out his cheek the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner  he used to say that a nap after dinner was silver before dinner  golden  he cast happy  sidelong glances at his son from under his thick  bushy eyebrows  prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him  he made no reply on his father s favorite topic making fun of the military men of the day  and more particularly of bonaparte yes  father  i have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant said prince andrew  following every movement of his father s face with an eager and respectful look  how is your health only fools and rakes fall ill  my boy  you know me  i am busy from morning till night and abstemious  so of course i am well thank god  said his son smiling god has nothing to do with it  well  go on  he continued  returning to his hobby  tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte by this new science you call strategy prince andrew smiled give me time to collect my wits  father  said he  with a smile that showed that his father s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him  why  i have not yet had time to settle down nonsense  nonsense  cried the old man  shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited  and grasping his by the hand  the house for your wife is ready  princess mary will take her there and show her over  and they ll talk nineteen to the dozen  that s their woman s way i am glad to have her  sit down and talk  about mikhelson s army i understand tolstoy s too  a simultaneous expedition  but what s the southern army to do  prussia is neutral  i know that  what about austria  said he  rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by tikhon  who ran after him  handing him different articles of clothing  what of sweden  how will they cross pomerania prince andrew  seeing that his father insisted  began at first reluctantly  but gradually with more and more animation  and from habit changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went on to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign  he explained how an army ninety thousand strong  was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war  how part of that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund  how two hundred and twenty thousand austrians  with a hundred thousand russians  were to operate in italy and on the rhine  how fifty thousand russians and as many english were to land at naples  and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the french from different sides  the old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation  but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about  and three times unexpectedly interrupted  once he stopped it by shouting  the white one  the white one this meant that tikhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted another time he interrupted  saying and will she soon be confined  and shaking his head reproachfully said  that s bad  go on  go on the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his description  the old man began to sing  in the cracked voice of old age malbrook s en va t en guerre  dieu sait quand reviendra   marlborough is going to the wars  god knows when he ll return his son only smiled i don t say it s a plan i approve of  said the son  i am only telling you what it is  napoleon has also formed his plan by now  not worse than this one well  you ve told me nothing new  and the old man repeated meditatively and rapidly dieu sait quand reviendra  go to the dining room chapter xxvii at the appointed hour the prince  powdered and shaven  entered the dining room where his daughter in law  princess mary  and mademoiselle bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect  who by a strange caprice of his employer s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor  the prince  who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table  had unexpectedly selected michael ivanovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief  to illustrate the theory that all men are equals  and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivanovich was not a whit worse than you or i  at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivanovich more often than to anyone else in the dining room  which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty  the members of the household and the footmen one behind each chair stood waiting for the prince to enter  the head butler  napkin on arm  was scanning the setting of the table  making signs to the footmen  and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter  prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame  new to him  containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkonski  opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate of a ruling prince  in a crown an alleged descendant of rurik and ancestor of the bolkonskis  prince andrew  looking again at that genealogical tree  shook his head  laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing how thoroughly like him that is  he said to princess mary  who had come up to him princess mary looked at her brother in surprise  she did not understand what he was laughing at  everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question everyone has his achilles  heel  continued prince andrew  fancy  with his powerful mind  indulging in such nonsense princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brother s criticism and was about to reply  when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study  the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont  as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house  at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room  the prince stood still  his lively glittering eyes from under their thick  bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess  she felt  as courtiers do when the tsar enters  the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him  he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck i m glad  glad  to see you  he said  looking attentively into her eyes  and then quickly went to his place and sat down  sit down  sit down  sit down  michael ianovich he indicated a place beside him to his daughter in law  a footman moved the chair for her ho  ho  said the old man  casting his eyes on her rounded figure you ve been in a hurry  that s bad he laughed in his usual dry  cold  unpleasant way  with his lips only and not with his eyes you must walk  walk as much as possible  as much as possible  he said the little princess did not  or did not wish to  hear his words  she was silent and seemed confused  the prince asked her about her father  and she began to smile and talk  he asked about mutual acquaintances  and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip countess apraksina  poor thing  has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out  she said  growing more and more lively as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly and suddenly  as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her  he turned away and addressed michael ivanovich well  michael ivanovich  our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it prince andrew  he always spoke thus of his son  has been telling me what forces are being collected against him  while you and i never thought much of him michael ivanovich did not at all know when you and i  had said such things about bonaparte  but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince s favorite topic  he looked inquiringly at the young prince  wondering what would follow he is a great tactician  said the prince to his son  pointing to the architect and the conversation again turned on the war  on bonaparte  and the generals and statesmen of the day  the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics  and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy  successful only because there were no longer any potemkins or suvorovs left to oppose him  but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war  but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing pretending to do something real  prince andrew gaily bore with his father s ridicule of the new men  and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure the past always seems good  said he  but did not suvorov himself fall into a trap moreau set him  and from which he did not know how to escape who told you that  who  cried the prince  suvorov  and he jerked away his plate  which tikhon briskly caught  suvorov  consider prince andrew  two  frederick and suvorov  moreau  moreau would have been a prisoner if suvorov had had a free hand  but he had the hofs kriegs wurst schnapps rath on his hands  it would have puzzled the devil himself  when you get there you ll find out what those hofs kriegs wurst raths are  suvorov couldn t manage them so what chance has michael kutuzov  no  my dear boy  he continued  you and your generals won t get on against buonaparte  you ll have to call in the french  so that birds of a feather may fight together  the german  pahlen  has been sent to new york in america  to fetch the frenchman  moreau  he said alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian service  wonderful  were the potemkins  suvorovs  and orlovs germans  no  lad  either you fellows have all lost your wits  or i have outlived mine  may god help you  but we ll see what will happen buonaparte has become a great commander among them  hm i don t at all say that all the plans are good  said prince andrew  i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte  you may laugh as much as you like  but all the same bonaparte is a great general michael ivanovich  cried the old prince to the architect who  busy with his roast meat  hoped he had been forgotten  didn t i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician  here  he says the same thing to be sure  your excellency  replied the architect the prince again laughed his frigid laugh buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth  he has got splendid soldiers  besides he began by attacking germans  and only idlers have failed to beat the germans  since the world began everybody has beaten the germans  they beat no one except one another  he made his reputation fighting them and the prince began explaining all the blunders which  according to him  bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics  his son made no rejoinder  but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion  he listened  refraining from a reply  and involuntarily wondered how this old man  living alone in the country for so many years  could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and political events you think i m an old man and don t understand the present state of affairs  concluded his father  but it troubles me  i don t sleep at night  come now  where has this great commander of yours shown his skill  he concluded that would take too long to tell  answered the son well  then go to your buonaparte  mademoiselle bourienne  here s another admirer of that powder monkey emperor of yours  he exclaimed in excellent french you know  prince  i am not a bonapartist dieu sait quand reviendra  hummed the prince out of tune and  with a laugh still more so  he quitted the table the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent  glancing with a frightened look now at her father in law and now at princess mary  when they left the table she took her sister in law s arm and drew her into another room what a clever man your father is  said she  perhaps that is why i am afraid of him oh  he is so kind  answered princess mary chapter xxviii prince andrew was to leave next evening  the old prince  not altering his routine  retired as usual after dinner  the little princess was in her sister in law s room  prince andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in  he ordered the horses to be harnessed  only those things he always kept with him remained in his room  a small box  a large canteen fitted with silver plate  two turkish pistols and a saber a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of ochakov  all these traveling effects of prince andrew s were in very good order  new  clean  and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life  men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind  at such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future  prince andrew s face looked very thoughtful and tender  with his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room  looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head  did he fear going to the war  or was he sad at leaving his wife perhaps both  but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood  for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands  stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box  and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression  it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard i hear you have given orders to harness  she cried  panting she had apparently been running  and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone  god knows how long we may again be parted  you are not angry with me for coming  you have changed so  andrusha  she added  as if to explain such a question she smiled as she uttered his pet name  andrusha  it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be andrusha the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood and where is lise  he asked  answering her question only by a smile she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room  oh andrew  what a treasure of a wife you have  said she  sitting down on the sofa  facing her brother  she is quite a child  such a dear  merry child  i have grown so fond of her prince andrew was silent  but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face one must be indulgent to little weaknesses  who is free from them andrew  don t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society and so her position now is not a rosy one  we should enter into everyone s situation  tout comprendre  c est tout pardonner   think what it must be for her  poor thing  after what she has been used to  to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country  in her condition  it s very hard  to understand all is to forgive all prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister  as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand you live in the country and don t think the life terrible  he replied i  that s different  why speak of me  i don t want any other life and can t  for i know no other  but think  andrew  for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life  all alone for papa is always busy  and i  well  you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society there is only mademoiselle bourienne i don t like your mademoiselle bourienne at all  said prince andrew no  she is very nice and kind and  above all  she s much to be pitied she has no one  no one  to tell the truth  i don t need her  and she s even in my way  you know i always was a savage  and now am even more so i like being alone  father likes her very much  she and michael ivanovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind because he has been a benefactor to them both  as sterne says  we don t love people so much for the good they have done us  as for the good we have done them  father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father  she is very good natured  and my father likes her way of reading  she reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly to be quite frank  mary  i expect father s character sometimes makes things trying for you  doesn t it  prince andrew asked suddenly princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question for me  for me  trying for me  said she he always was rather harsh  and now i should think he s getting very trying  said prince andrew  apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister you are good in every way  andrew  but you have a kind of intellectual pride  said the princess  following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation and that s a great sin  how can one judge father  but even if one might  what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke  and i am so contented and happy with him  i only wish you were all as happy as i am her brother shook his head incredulously the only thing that is hard for me  i will tell you the truth andrew  is father s way of treating religious subjects  i don t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day  and can go so far astray  that is the only thing that makes me unhappy  but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement  his satire has been less bitter of late  and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with ah  my dear  i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly ah  mon ami  i only pray  and hope that god will hear me  andrew she said timidly after a moment s silence  i have a great favor to ask of you what is it  dear no promise that you will not refuse  it will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you  but it will comfort me  promise andrusha  said she  putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it  as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted she looked timidly at her brother even if it were a great deal of trouble  answered prince andrew  as if guessing what it was about think what you please  i know you are just like father  think as you please  but do this for my sake  please do  father s father  our grandfather  wore it in all his wars  she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule  so you promise of course  what is it andrew  i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off  do you promise if it does not weigh a hundredweight and won t break my neck  to please you  said prince andrew  but immediately  noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister s face  he repented and added  i am glad  really  dear  i am very glad against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to himself  for in him alone is truth and peace  said she in a voice trembling with emotion  solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small  oval  antique  dark faced icon of the saviour in a gold setting  on a finely wrought silver chain she crossed herself  kissed the icon  and handed it to andrew please  andrew  for my sake rays of gentle light shone from her large  timid eyes  those eyes lit up the whole of her thin  sickly face and made it beautiful  her brother would have taken the icon  but she stopped him  andrew understood crossed himself and kissed the icon  there was a look of tenderness  for he was touched  but also a gleam of irony on his face thank you  my dear  she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa  they were silent for a while as i was saying to you  andrew  be kind and generous as you always used to be  don t judge lise harshly  she began  she is so sweet  so good natured  and her position now is a very hard one i do not think i have complained of my wife to you  masha  or blamed her  why do you say all this to me red patches appeared on princess mary s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty i have said nothing to you  but you have already been talked to  and i am sorry for that  he went on the patches grew deeper on her forehead  neck  and cheeks  she tried to say something but could not  her brother had guessed right  the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement  and how she dreaded it  and had complained of her fate  her father in law  and her husband  after crying she had fallen asleep  prince andrew felt sorry for his sister know this  masha  i can t reproach  have not reproached  and never shall reproach my wife with anything  and i cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her  and that always will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed  but if you want to know the truth  if you want to know whether i am happy  no  is she happy  no  but why this is so i don t know as he said this he rose  went to his sister  and  stooping  kissed her forehead  his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful  kindly  and unaccustomed brightness  but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway let us go to her  i must say good by  or go and wake and i ll come in a moment  petrushka  he called to his valet  come here  take these away  put this on the seat and this to the right princess mary rose and moved to the door  then stopped and said andrew  if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the love you do not feel  and your prayer would have been answered well  may be  said prince andrew  go  masha  i ll come immediately on the way to his sister s room  in the passage which connected one wing with the other  prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly  it was the third time that day that  with an ecstatic and artless smile  she had met him in secluded passages oh  i thought you were in your room  she said  for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face  he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair  without looking at her eyes  with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word  when he reached his sister s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice  hurrying one word after another  came through the open door  she was speaking as usual in french  and as if after long self restraint she wished to make up for lost time no  but imagine the old countess zubova  with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth  as if she were trying to cheat old age  ha  ha ha  mary this very sentence about countess zubova and this same laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times  he entered the room softly  the little princess  plump and rosy  was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands  talking incessantly  repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases  prince andrew came up  stroked her hair  and asked if she felt rested after their journey  she answered him and continued her chatter the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch  it was an autumn night  so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch  the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows  the domestic serfs were crowding in the hall  waiting to bid good by to the young prince  the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall  michael ivanovich  mademoiselle bourienne  princess mary  and the little princess  prince andrew had been called to his father s study as the latter wished to say good by to him alone  all were waiting for them to come out when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his old age spectacles and white dressing gown  in which he received no one but his son  sat at the table writing  he glanced round going  and he went on writing i ve come to say good by kiss me here  and he touched his cheek  thanks  thanks what do you thank me for for not dilly dallying and not hanging to a woman s apron strings  the service before everything  thanks  thanks  and he went on writing  so that his quill spluttered and squeaked  if you have anything to say say it  these two things can be done together  he added about my wife  i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands why talk nonsense  say what you want when her confinement is due  send to moscow for an accoucheur  let him be here the old prince stopped writing and  as if not understanding  fixed his stern eyes on his son i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work  said prince andrew  evidently confused  i know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong  but it is her fancy and mine  they have been telling her things  she has had a dream and is frightened hm  hm  muttered the old prince to himself  finishing what he was writing  i ll do it he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh it s a bad business  eh what is bad  father the wife  said the old prince  briefly and significantly i don t understand  said prince andrew no  it can t be helped  lad  said the prince  they re all like that one can t unmarry  don t be afraid  i won t tell anyone  but you know it yourself he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers  shook it  looked straight into his son s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him  and again laughed his frigid laugh the son sighed  thus admitting that his father had understood him  the old man continued to fold and seal his letter  snatching up and throwing down the wax  the seal  and the paper  with his accustomed rapidity what s to be done  she s pretty  i will do everything  make your mind easy  said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter andrew did not speak  he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him  the old man got up and gave the letter to his son listen  said he

disfavor  now come here kutuzov he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words  but his son was accustomed to understand him  he led him to the desk  raised the lid  drew out a drawer  and took out an exercise book filled with his bold  tall  close handwriting i shall probably die before you  so remember  these are my memoirs hand them to the emperor after my death  now here is a lombard bond and a letter  it is a premium for the man who writes a history of suvorov s wars  send it to the academy  here are some jottings for you to read when i am gone  you will find them useful andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet  he felt that he must not say it i will do it all  father  he said well  now  good by  he gave his son his hand to kiss  and embraced him  remember this  prince andrew  if they kill you it will hurt me your old father  he paused unexpectedly  and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked  but if i hear that you have not behaved like a son of nicholas bolkonski  i shall be ashamed you need not have said that to me  father  said the son with a smile the old man was silent i also wanted to ask you  continued prince andrew  if i m killed and if i have a son  do not let him be taken away from you as i said yesterday  let him grow up with you  please not let the wife have him  said the old man  and laughed they stood silent  facing one another  the old man s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son s  something twitched in the lower part of the old prince s face we ve said good by  go  he suddenly shouted in a loud  angry voice opening his door what is it  what  asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown  spectacled and wigless  shouting in an angry voice prince andrew sighed and made no reply well  he said  turning to his wife and this well  sounded coldly ironic  as if he were saying  now go through your performance andrew  already  said the little princess  turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband he embraced her  she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on  looked into her face and carefully placed her in an easy chair adieu  mary  said he gently to his sister  taking her by the hand and kissing her  and then he left the room with rapid steps the little princess lay in the armchair  mademoiselle bourienne chafing her temples  princess mary  supporting her sister in law  still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction  from the study  like pistol shots  came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose  hardly had prince andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out gone  that s all right  said he  and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess  he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door book two  chapter i in october   a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria  and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered  braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief  kutuzov on october   one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town  waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief  despite the un russian appearance of the locality and surroundings fruit gardens  stone fences  tiled roofs  and hills in the distance and despite the fact that the inhabitants who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers  were not russians  the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia on the evening of the last day s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march  though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander  and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not  it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order  on the principle that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low enough  so the soldiers after a twenty mile march  were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes  while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned  and by morning the regiment instead of the straggling  disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before presented a well ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty  had every button and every strap in place and shone with cleanliness  and not only externally was all in order but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt  and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles  awl  soap  and all  as the soldiers say there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease  it was the state of the soldiers  boots  more than half the men s boots were in holes  but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander  for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat  and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles the commander of the regiment was an elderly  choleric  stout  and thick set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers  and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders  he had on a brand new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders  he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life  he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up  slightly arching his back  it was plain that the commander admired his regiment  rejoiced in it  and that his whole mind was engrossed by it  yet his strut seemed to indicate that  besides military matters  social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts well  michael mitrich  sir  he said  addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both felt happy  we had our hands full last night  however  i think the regiment is not a bad one  eh the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed it would not be turned off the field even on the tsaritsin meadow what  asked the commander at that moment  on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted  two men appeared on horse back  they were an aide de camp followed by a cossack the aide de camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before  namely  that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march  in their greatcoats  and packs  and without any preparation whatever a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutuzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack  and kutuzov  not considering this junction advisable  meant  among other arguments in support of his view to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia  with this object he intended to meet the regiment so the worse the condition it was in  the better pleased the commander in chief would be  though the aide de camp did not know these circumstances  he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order  and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied  on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head  silently shrugged his shoulders  and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture a fine mess we ve made of it  he remarked there now  didn t i tell you  michael mitrich  that if it was said on the march  it meant in greatcoats  said he reproachfully to the battalion commander  oh  my god  he added  stepping resolutely forward  company commanders  he shouted in a voice accustomed to command  sergeants major  how soon will he be here  he asked the aide de camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to in an hour s time  i should say shall we have time to change clothes i don t know  general the regimental commander  going up to the line himself  ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats  the company commanders ran off to their companies  the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats were not in very good condition  and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices  on all sides soldiers were running to and fro  throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads  unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms in half an hour all was again in order  only the squares had become gray instead of black  the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance whatever is this  this  he shouted and stood still  commander of the third company commander of the third company wanted by the general  commander to the general  third company to the commander  the words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of  the general to the third company  the missing officer appeared from behind his company and  though he was a middle aged man and not in the habit of running  trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general  the captain s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned  spots appeared on his nose the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance  and his mouth twitched nervously  the general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting  slackening his pace as he approached you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats  what is this shouted the regimental commander  thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth  which contrasted with the others  what have you been after  the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place  eh  i ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade  eh the commander of the company  with his eyes fixed on his superior pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap  as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation well  why don t you speak  whom have you got there dressed up as a hungarian  said the commander with an austere gibe your excellency well  your excellency  what  your excellency  but what about your excellency  nobody knows your excellency  it s the officer dolokhov  who has been reduced to the ranks  said the captain softly well  has he been degraded into a field marshal  or into a soldier  if a soldier  he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others your excellency  you gave him leave yourself  on the march gave him leave  leave  that s just like you young men  said the regimental commander cooling down a little  leave indeed  one says a word to you and you  what  he added with renewed irritation  i beg you to dress your men decently and the commander  turning to look at the adjutant  directed his jerky steps down the line  he was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath  having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge  at another because his line was not straight  he reached the third company h o o w are you standing  where s your leg  your leg  shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice  while there were still five men between him and dolokhov with his bluish gray uniform dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee  looking straight with his clear  insolent eyes in the general s face why a blue coat  off with it  sergeant major  change his coat  the ras  he did not finish general  i must obey orders  but i am not bound to endure  dolokhov hurriedly interrupted no talking in the ranks  no talking  no talking not bound to endure insults  dolokhov concluded in loud  ringing tones the eyes of the general and the soldier met  the general became silent angrily pulling down his tight scarf i request you to have the goodness to change your coat  he said as he turned away chapter ii he s coming  shouted the signaler at that moment the regimental commander  flushing  ran to his horse  seized the stirrup with trembling hands  threw his body across the saddle  righted himself drew his saber  and with a happy and resolute countenance  opening his mouth awry  prepared to shout  the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless att ention  shouted the regimental commander in a soul shaking voice which expressed joy for himself  severity for the regiment  and welcome for the approaching chief along the broad country road  edged on both sides by trees  came a high light blue viennese caleche  slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot  behind the caleche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats  beside kutuzov sat an austrian general  in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones  the caleche stopped in front of the regiment  kutuzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutuzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist the word of command rang out  and again the regiment quivered  as with a jingling sound it presented arms  then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard  the regiment roared  health to your ex  len  len  lency  and again all became silent  at first kutuzov stood still while the regiment moved  then he and the general in white  accompanied by the suite  walked between the ranks from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes  drawing himself up obsequiously  and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals  bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements  and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief  it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander  thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment  in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time  was in splendid condition  there were only  sick and stragglers  everything was in good order except the boots kutuzov walked through the ranks  sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war  sometimes also to the soldiers  looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly  pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone  but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was  the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion  fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief s regarding the regiment  behind kutuzov  at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard  followed some twenty men of his suite  these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed  nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant  this was prince bolkonski  beside him was his comrade nesvitski  a tall staff officer  extremely stout  with a kindly smiling  handsome face and moist eyes  nesvitski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him this hussar  with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes  watched the regimental commander s back and mimicked his every movement  each time the commander started and bent forward  the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner  nesvitski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag kutuzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief  on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped  his suite  not having expected this involuntarily came closer to him ah  timokhin  said he  recognizing the red nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timokhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander  but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him  and so kutuzov who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good quickly turned away  a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face another ismail comrade  said he  a brave officer  are you satisfied with him  he asked the regimental commander and the latter unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass started  moved forward  and answered highly satisfied  your excellency we all have our weaknesses  said kutuzov smiling and walking away from him  he used to have a predilection for bacchus the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer  the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red nosed captain and his drawn in stomach  and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvitski could not help laughing  kutuzov turned round  the officer evidently had complete control of his face and while kutuzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious  deferential  and innocent expression the third company was the last  and kutuzov pondered  apparently trying to recollect something  prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french you told me to remind you of the officer dolokhov  reduced to the ranks in this regiment where is dolokhov  asked kutuzov dolokhov  who had already changed into a soldier s gray greatcoat  did not wait to be called  the shapely figure of the fair haired soldier with his clear blue eyes  stepped forward from the ranks  went up to the commander in chief  and presented arms have you a complaint to make  kutuzov asked with a slight frown this is dolokhov  said prince andrew ah  said kutuzov  i hope this will be a lesson to you  do your duty the emperor is gracious  and i shan t forget you if you deserve well the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander  seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private one thing i ask of your excellency  dolokhov said in his firm ringing  deliberate voice  i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia kutuzov turned away  the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timokhin again flitted over his face  he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dolokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him  that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted  he turned away and went to the carriage the regiment broke up into companies  which went to their appointed quarters near braunau  where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches you won t bear me a grudge  prokhor ignatych  said the regimental commander  overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timokhin who was walking in front  the regimental commander s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight  it s in the emperor s service  it can t be helped  one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade  i am the first to apologize  you know me  he was very pleased  and he held out his hand to the captain don t mention it  general  as if i d be so bold  replied the captain his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail and tell mr  dolokhov that i won t forget him he may be quite easy and tell me  please i ve been meaning to ask how is he behaving himself  and in general as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious  your excellency but his character  said timokhin and what about his character  asked the regimental commander it s different on different days  answered the captain  one day he is sensible  well educated  and good natured  and the next he s a wild beast  in poland  if you please  he nearly killed a jew oh  well  well  remarked the regimental commander  still  one must have pity on a young man in misfortune  you know he has important connections  well  then  you just i will  your excellency  said timokhin  showing by his smile that he understood his commander s wish well  of course  of course the regimental commander sought out dolokhov in the ranks and  reining in his horse  said to him after the next affair  epaulettes dolokhov looked round but did not say anything  nor did the mocking smile on his lips change well  that s all right  continued the regimental commander  a cup of vodka for the men from me  he added so that the soldiers could hear  i thank you all  god be praised  and he rode past that company and overtook the next one well  he s really a good fellow  one can serve under him  said timokhin to the subaltern beside him in a word  a hearty one  said the subaltern  laughing the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers  the company marched on gaily  the soldiers  voices could be heard on every side and they said kutuzov was blind of one eye and so he is  quite blind no  friend  he is sharper eyed than you are  boots and leg bands  he noticed everything when he looked at my feet  friend  well  thinks i and that other one with him  the austrian  looked as if he were smeared with chalk as white as flour  i suppose they polish him up as they do the guns i say  fedeshon  did he say when the battles are to begin  you were near him  everybody said that buonaparte himself was at braunau buonaparte himself  just listen to the fool  what he doesn t know the prussians are up in arms now  the austrians  you see  are putting them down  when they ve been put down  the war with buonaparte will begin  and he says buonaparte is in braunau  shows you re a fool  you d better listen more carefully what devils these quartermasters are  see  the fifth company is turning into the village already  they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters give me a biscuit  you devil and did you give me tobacco yesterday  that s just it  friend  ah well  never mind  here you are they might call a halt here or we ll have to do another four miles without eating wasn t it fine when those germans gave us lifts  you just sit still and are drawn along and here  friend  the people are quite beggarly  there they all seemed to be poles all under the russian crown but here they re all regular germans singers to the front  came the captain s order and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front  a drummer  their leader  turned round facing the singers  and flourishing his arm  began a long drawn out soldiers  song  commencing with the words  morning dawned  the sun was rising  and concluding  on then brothers  on to glory  led by father kamenski  this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria  the only change being that the words father kamenski  were replaced by father kutuzov having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground  the drummer a lean  handsome soldier of forty looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him  he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and  holding it there for some seconds  suddenly flung it down and began oh  my bower  oh  my bower oh  my bower new  chimed in twenty voices  and the castanet player in spite of the burden of his equipment  rushed out to the front and walking backwards before the company  jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone  the soldiers swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously  marched with long steps  behind the company the sound of wheels  the creaking of springs and the tramp of horses  hoofs were heard  kutuzov and his suite were returning to the town  the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease  and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men  in the second file from the right flank  beside which the carriage passed the company  a blue eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice  it was dolokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company  the hussar cornet of kutuzov s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander  fell back from the carriage and rode up to dolokhov hussar cornet zherkov had at one time  in petersburg  belonged to the wild set led by dolokhov  zherkov had met dolokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him  but now that kutuzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker  he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend my dear fellow  how are you  said he through the singing  making his horse keep pace with the company how am i  dolokhov answered coldly  i am as you see the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkov spoke  and to the intentional coldness of dolokhov s reply and how do you get on with the officers  inquired zherkov all right  they are good fellows  and how have you wriggled onto the staff i was attached  i m on duty both were silent she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve  went the song arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness  their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song is it true that austrians have been beaten  asked dolokhov the devil only knows  they say so i m glad  answered dolokhov briefly and clearly  as the song demanded i say  come round some evening and we ll have a game of faro  said zherkov why  have you too much money do come i can t  i ve sworn not to  i won t drink and won t play till i get reinstated well  that s only till the first engagement we shall see they were again silent come if you need anything  one can at least be of use on the staff dolokhov smiled  don t trouble  if i want anything  i won t beg i ll take it well  never mind  i only and i only good bye good health it s a long  long way  to my native land zherkov touched his horse with the spurs  it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start  then settled down  galloped past the company  and overtook the carriage  still keeping time to the song chapter iii on returning from the review  kutuzov took the austrian general into his private room and  calling his adjutant  asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival  and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand  who was in command of the advanced army  prince andrew bolkonski came into the room with the required papers  kutuzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out ah  said kutuzov glancing at bolkonski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait  and he went on with the conversation in french all i can say  general  said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word  it was evident that kutuzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice  all i can say  general  is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes  the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago  i should long ago have joined the archduke  and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general of whom austria has so many and to lay down all this heavy responsibility  but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us  general and kutuzov smiled in a way that seemed to say  you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i don t even care whether you do or not but you have no grounds for telling me so  and that is the whole point the austrian general looked dissatisfied  but had no option but to reply in the same tone on the contrary  he said  in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words  on the contrary  your excellency s participation in the common action is highly valued by his majesty  but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles  he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence kutuzov bowed with the same smile but that is my conviction  and judging by the last letter with which his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me  i imagine that the austrian troops  under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack  have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid  said kutuzov the general frowned  though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat  there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat  and so kutuzov s suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony  but kutuzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression  which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so and  in fact  the last letter he had received from mack s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable give me that letter  said kutuzov turning to prince andrew  please have a look at it and kutuzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage  in german  from the archduke ferdinand s letter we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech  also  as we are masters of ulm  we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube  so that should the enemy not cross the lech  we can cross the danube  throw ourselves on his line of communications  recross the river lower down  and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally  we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped  and shall then  in conjunction with it  easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves kutuzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively but you know the wise maxim your excellency  advising one to expect the worst  said the austrian general  evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business  he involuntarily looked round at the aide de camp excuse me  general  interrupted kutuzov  also turning to prince andrew  look here  my dear fellow  get from kozlovski all the reports from our scouts  here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these  he said handing him several papers  make a neat memorandum in french out of all this  showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army  and then give it to his excellency prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutuzov would have liked to tell him  he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both  stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia  he had changed greatly during that period  in the expression of his face in his movements  in his walk  scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence  he now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others  but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work  his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him  his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive kutuzov  whom he had overtaken in poland  had received him very kindly promised not to forget him  distinguished him above the other adjutants and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions from vienna kutuzov wrote to his old comrade  prince andrew s father your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry firmness  and expedition  i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me on kutuzov s staff  among his fellow officers and in the army generally prince andrew had  as he had had in petersburg society  two quite opposite reputations  some  a minority  acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else  expected great things of him listened to him  admired  and imitated him  and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant  others  the majority  disliked him and considered him conceited  cold  and disagreeable  but among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him coming out of kutuzov s room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade  the aide de camp on duty kozlovski  who was sitting at the window with a book well  prince  asked kozlovski i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing and why is it prince andrew shrugged his shoulders any news from mack no if it were true that he has been beaten  news would have come probably  said prince andrew moving toward the outer door but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat  with the order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head who had evidently just arrived  entered quickly  slamming the door prince andrew stopped short commander in chief kutuzov  said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent  looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door the commander in chief is engaged  said kozlovski  going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door  whom shall i announce the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlovski  who was rather short  as if surprised that anyone should not know him the commander in chief is engaged  repeated kozlovski calmly the general s face clouded  his lips quivered and trembled  he took out a notebook  hurriedly scribbled something in pencil  tore out the leaf gave it to kozlovski  stepped quickly to the window  and threw himself into a chair  gazing at those in the room as if asking  why do they look at me  then he lifted his head  stretched his neck as if he intended to say something  but immediately  with affected indifference began to hum to himself  producing a queer sound which immediately broke off  the door of the private room opened and kutuzov appeared in the doorway  the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger  and  making long  quick strides with his thin legs  went up to kutuzov vous voyez le malheureux mack  he uttered in a broken voice kutuzov s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments  then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again  he bowed his head respectfully closed his eyes  silently let mack enter his room before him  and closed the door himself behind him the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the russian troops  who had hitherto been inactive  would also soon have to meet the enemy prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war  when he saw mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost understood all the difficulties of the russian army s position  and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a week s time he might perhaps  see and take part in the first russian encounter with the french since suvorov met them  he feared that bonaparte s genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops  and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father  to whom he wrote every day  in the corridor he met nesvitski  with whom he shared a room  and the wag zherkov  they were as usual laughing why are you so glum  asked nesvitski noticing prince andrew s pale face and glittering eyes there s nothing to be gay about  answered bolkonski just as prince andrew met nesvitski and zherkov  there came toward them from the other end of the corridor  strauch  an austrian general who on kutuzov s staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army  and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily  but zherkov  pushing nesvitski aside with his arm  said in a breathless voice they re coming  they re coming  stand aside  make way  please make way the generals were passing by  looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions  on the face of the wag zherkov there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress your excellency  said he in german  stepping forward and addressing the austrian general  i have the honor to congratulate you he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other  awkwardly  like a child at a dancing lesson the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but  seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile  could not but give him a moment s attention  he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening i have the honor to congratulate you  general mack has arrived  quite well  only a little bruised just here  he added  pointing with a beaming smile to his head the general frowned  turned away  and went on gott  wie naiv   said he angrily  after he had gone a few steps  good god  what simplicity nesvitski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew  but bolkonski  turning still paler  pushed him away with an angry look and turned to zherkov  the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack  the news of his defeat  and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent in anger at zherkov s untimely jest if you  sir  choose to make a buffoon of yourself  he said sharply with a slight trembling of the lower jaw  i can t prevent your doing so  but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence  i will teach you to behave yourself nesvitski and zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkonski silently with wide open eyes what s the matter  i only congratulated them  said zherkov i am not jesting with you  please be silent  cried bolkonski  and taking nesvitski s arm he left zherkov  who did not know what to say come  what s the matter  old fellow  said nesvitski trying to soothe him what s the matter  exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his excitement  don t you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country  rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause  or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master s business  quarante mille hommes massacres et l armee de nos allies detruite  et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire  he said  as if strengthening his views by this french sentence  c est bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami  mais pas pour vous  pas pour vous   only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way  he added in russian but pronouncing the word with a french accent having noticed that zherkov could still hear him  forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed and you find that a cause for jesting   it is all very well for that good for nothing fellow of whom you have made a friend  but not for you  not for you he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer  but he turned and went out of the corridor chapter iv the pavlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau  the squadron in which nicholas rostov served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck  the best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry captain denisov  the squadron commander  known throughout the whole cavalry division as vaska denisov  cadet rostov ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland  had lived with the squadron commander on october  the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of mack s defeat  the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual  denisov  who had been losing at cards all night had not yet come home when rostov rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition  rostov in his cadet uniform  with a jerk to his horse  rode up to the porch  swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement  stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse  and at last sprang down and called to his orderly ah  bondarenko  dear friend  said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse  walk him up and down  my dear fellow  he continued  with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy yes  your excellency  answered the ukrainian gaily  tossing his head mind  walk him up and down well another hussar also rushed toward the horse  but bondarenko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse s head  it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him  rostov patted the horse s neck and then his flank  and lingered for a moment splendid  what a horse he will be  he thought with a smile  and holding up his saber  his spurs jingling  he ran up the steps of the porch  his landlord  who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap  pitchfork in hand  was clearing manure from the cowhouse  looked out  and his face immediately brightened on seeing rostov  schon gut morgen  schon gut morgen   he said winking with a merry smile  evidently pleased to greet the young man  a very good morning  a very good morning schon fleissig   said rostov with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face  hoch oestreicher  hoch russen  kaiser alexander hoch   said he  quoting words often repeated by the german landlord  busy already   hurrah for the austrians  hurrah for the russians  hurrah for emperor alexander the german laughed  came out of the cowshed  pulled off his cap  and waving it above his head cried und die ganze welt hoch   and hurrah for the whole world rostov waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing und vivat die ganze welt  though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostov back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing  they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love  wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection and parted smiling  the german returning to his cowshed and rostov going to the cottage he occupied with denisov what about your master  he asked lavrushka  denisov s orderly  whom all the regiment knew for a rogue hasn t been in since the evening  must have been losing  answered lavrushka  i know by now  if he wins he comes back early to brag about it  but if he stays out till morning it means he s lost and will come back in a rage  will you have coffee yes  bring some ten minutes later lavrushka brought the coffee  he s coming  said he now for trouble  rostov looked out of the window and saw denisov coming home  denisov was a small man with a red face  sparkling black eyes  and black tousled mustache and hair  he wore an unfastened cloak wide breeches hanging down in creases  and a crumpled shako on the back of his head  he came up to the porch gloomily  hanging his head lavwuska  he shouted loudly and angrily  take it off  blockhead well  i am taking it off  replied lavrushka s voice ah  you re up already  said denisov  entering the room long ago  answered rostov  i have already been for the hay  and have seen fraulein mathilde weally  and i ve been losing  bwother  i lost yesterday like a damned fool  cried denisov  not pronouncing his r s  such ill luck  such ill luck  as soon as you left  it began and went on  hullo there  tea puckering up his face though smiling  and showing his short strong teeth  he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair and what devil made me go to that wat  an officer nicknamed the rat  he said  rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands just fancy  he didn t let me win a single cahd  not one cahd he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him  gripped it in his fist  and tapped it on the floor  making the sparks fly  while he continued to shout he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it gives the singles and snatches the doubles he scattered the burning tobacco  smashed the pipe  and threw it away then he remained silent for a while  and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering  black eyes at rostov if at least we had some women here  but there s nothing foh one to do but dwink  if we could only get to fighting soon  hullo  who s there he said  turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop  and a respectful cough the squadron quartermaster  said lavrushka denisov s face puckered still more wetched  he muttered  throwing down a purse with some gold in it wostov  deah fellow  just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow  he said  and went out to the quartermaster rostov took the money and  mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles  began counting them ah  telyanin  how d ye do  they plucked me last night  came denisov s voice from the next room where  at bykov s  at the rat s  i knew it  replied a piping voice and lieutenant telyanin  a small officer of the same squadron  entered the room rostov thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him  telyanin for some reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign  he behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked  rostov especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man well  young cavalryman  how is my rook behaving  he asked  rook was a young horse telyanin had sold to rostov the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face  his eyes continually wandered from one object to another i saw you riding this morning  he added oh  he s all right  a good horse  answered rostov  though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum he s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg  he added the hoof s cracked  that s nothing  i ll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use yes  please do  said rostov i ll show you  i ll show you  it s not a secret  and it s a horse you ll thank me for then i ll have it brought round  said rostov wishing to avoid telyanin  and he went out to give the order in the passage denisov  with a pipe  was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him  on seeing rostov denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where telyanin was sitting  he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust ugh  i don t like that fellow  he said  regardless of the quartermaster s presence rostov shrugged his shoulders as much as to say  nor do i  but what s one to do  and  having given his order  he returned to telyanin telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostov had left him  rubbing his small white hands well there certainly are disgusting people  thought rostov as he entered have you told them to bring the horse  asked telyanin  getting up and looking carelessly about him i have let us go ourselves  i only came round to ask denisov about yesterday s order  have you got it  denisov not yet  but where are you off to i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse  said telyanin they went through the porch and into the stable  the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters when rostov went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table  denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper  he looked gloomily in rostov s face and said  i am witing to her he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write  told rostov the contents of his letter you see  my fwiend  he said  we sleep when we don t love  we are childwen of the dust  but one falls in love and one is a god  one is pua  as on the first day of cweation  who s that now  send him to the devil  i m busy  he shouted to lavrushka  who went up to him not in the least abashed who should it be  you yourself told him to come  it s the quartermaster for the money denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped wetched business  he muttered to himself  how much is left in the puhse  he asked  turning to rostov seven new and three old imperials oh  it s wetched  well  what are you standing there for  you sca cwow call the quahtehmasteh  he shouted to lavrushka please  denisov  let me lend you some  i have some  you know  said rostov  blushing don t like bowwowing from my own fellows  i don t  growled denisov but if you won t accept money from me like a comrade  you will offend me  really i have some  rostov repeated no  i tell you and denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow where have you put it  wostov under the lower pillow it s not there denisov threw both pillows on the floor  the purse was not there that s a miwacle wait  haven t you dropped it  said rostov  picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them he pulled off the quilt and shook it  the purse was not there dear me  can i have forgotten  no  i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure  said rostov  i put it just here where is it  he asked  turning to lavrushka i haven t been in the room  it must be where you put it but it isn t you re always like that  you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it feel in your pockets no  if i hadn t thought of it being a treasure  said rostov  but i remember putting it there lavrushka turned all the bedding over  looked under the bed and under the table  searched everywhere  and stood still in the middle of the room  denisov silently watched lavrushka s movements  and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found denisov glanced at rostov wostov  you ve not been playing schoolboy twicks rostov felt denisov s gaze fixed on him  raised his eyes  and instantly dropped them again  all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes  he could not draw breath and there hasn t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves  it must be here somewhere  said lavrushka now then  you devil s puppet  look alive and hunt for it  shouted denisov  suddenly  turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture  if the purse isn t found i ll flog you  i ll flog you all rostov  his eyes avoiding denisov  began buttoning his coat  buckled on his saber  and put on his cap i must have that purse  i tell you  shouted denisov  shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall denisov  let him alone  i know who has taken it  said rostov  going toward the door without raising his eyes  denisov paused  thought a moment  and  evidently understanding what rostov hinted at  seized his arm nonsense  he cried  and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords  you are mad  i tell you  i won t allow it  the purse is here  i ll flay this scoundwel alive  and it will be found i know who has taken it  repeated rostov in an unsteady voice  and went to the door and i tell you  don t you dahe to do it  shouted denisov  rushing at the cadet to restrain him but rostov pulled away his arm and  with as much anger as though denisov were his worst enemy  firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face do you understand what you re saying  he said in a trembling voice there was no one else in the room except myself  so that if it is not so  then he could not finish  and ran out of the room ah  may the devil take you and evewybody  were the last words rostov heard rostov went to telyanin s quarters the master is not in  he s gone to headquarters  said telyanin s orderly  has something happened  he added  surprised at the cadet s troubled face no  nothing you ve only just missed him  said the orderly the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck  and rostov  without returning home  took a horse and rode there  there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented  rostov rode up to it and saw telyanin s horse at the porch in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine ah  you ve come here too  young man  he said  smiling and raising his eyebrows yes  said rostov as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word  and he sat down at the nearest table both were silent  there were two germans and a russian officer in the room  no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant when telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and  drawing its rings aside with his small  white  turned up fingers  drew out a gold imperial  and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter please be quick  he said the coin was a new one  rostov rose and went up to telyanin allow me to look at your purse  he said in a low  almost inaudible voice with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised  telyanin handed him the purse yes  it s a nice purse  yes  yes  he said  growing suddenly pale  and added  look at it  young man rostov took the purse in his hand  examined it and the money in it  and looked at telyanin  the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry if we get to vienna i ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there s nowhere to spend it  said he  well  let me have it  young man  i m going rostov did not speak and you  are you going to have lunch too  they feed you quite decently here  continued telyanin  now then  let me have it he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse  rostov let go of it  telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches  with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open  as if to say  yes  yes  i am putting my purse in my pocket and that s quite simple and is no one else s business well  young man  he said with a sigh  and from under his lifted brows he glanced into rostov s eyes some flash as of an electric spark shot from telyanin s eyes to rostov s and back  and back again and again in an instant come here  said rostov  catching hold of telyanin s arm and almost dragging him to the window  that money is denisov s  you took it  he whispered just above telyanin s ear what  what  how dare you  what  said telyanin but these words came like a piteous  despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon  as soon as rostov heard them  an enormous load of doubt fell from him  he was glad  and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him  but the task he had begun had to be completed heaven only knows what the people here may imagine  muttered telyanin taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room  we must have an explanation i know it and shall prove it  said rostov i every muscle of telyanin s pale  terrified face began to quiver  his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to rostov s face  and his sobs were audible count  don t ruin a young fellow  here is this wretched money take it  he threw it on the table  i have an old father and mother rostov took the money  avoiding telyanin s eyes  and went out of the room without a word  but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps  o god  he said with tears in his eyes  how could you do it count  said telyanin drawing nearer to him don t touch me  said rostov  drawing back  if you need it  take the money  and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn chapter v that same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron s officers in denisov s quarters and i tell you  rostov  that you must apologize to the colonel  said a tall  grizzly haired staff captain  with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features  to rostov who was crimson with excitement the staff captain  kirsten  had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission i will allow no one to call me a liar  cried rostov  he told me i lied  and i told him he lied  and there it rests  he may keep me on duty every day  or may place me under arrest  but no one can make me apologize  because if he  as commander of this regiment  thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction  then you just wait a moment  my dear fellow  and listen  interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass  calmly stroking his long mustache  you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen i m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers  perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them  but i am not a diplomatist  that s why i joined the hussars  thinking that here one would not need finesse  and he tells me that i am lying so let him give me satisfaction that s all right  no one thinks you a coward  but that s not the point ask denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation  evidently with no wish to take part in it  he answered the staff captain s question by a disapproving shake of his head you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers  continued the staff captain  and bogdanich  the colonel was called bogdanich  shuts you up he did not shut me up  he said i was telling an untruth well  have it so  and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize not on any account  exclaimed rostov i did not expect this of you  said the staff captain seriously and severely  you don t wish to apologize  but  man  it s not only to him but to the whole regiment all of us you re to blame all round  the case is this  you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice  but no  you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers  now what was the colonel to do  have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment  disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel  is that how you look at it  we don t see it like that  and bogdanich was a brick  he told you you were saying what was not true it s not pleasant  but what s to be done  my dear fellow  you landed yourself in it  and now  when one wants to smooth the thing over  some conceit prevents your apologizing  and you wish to make the whole affair public  you are offended at being put on duty a bit  but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer  whatever bogdanich may be anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel  you re quick at taking offense  but you don t mind disgracing the whole regiment  the staff captain s voice began to tremble  you have been in the regiment next to no time  my lad  you re here today and tomorrow you ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said there are thieves among the pavlograd officers  but it s not all the same to us am i not right  denisov  it s not the same denisov remained silent and did not move  but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at rostov you value your own pride and don t wish to apologize  continued the staff captain  but we old fellows  who have grown up in and  god willing  are going to die in the regiment  we prize the honor of the regiment  and bogdanich knows it  oh  we do prize it  old fellow  and all this is not right  it s not right  you may take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth  it s not right and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostov that s twue  devil take it  shouted denisov  jumping up  now then wostov  now then rostov  growing red and pale alternately  looked first at one officer and then at the other no  gentlemen  no  you mustn t think  i quite understand  you re wrong to think that of me  i  for me  for the honor of the regiment i d  ah well  i ll show that in action  and for me the honor of the flag  well  never mind  it s true i m to blame  to blame all round  well  what else do you want come  that s right  count  cried the staff captain  turning round and clapping rostov on the shoulder with his big hand i tell you  shouted denisov  he s a fine fellow that s better  count  said the staff captain  beginning to address rostov by his title  as if in recognition of his confession  go and apologize  your excellency  yes  go gentlemen  i ll do anything  no one shall hear a word from me  said rostov in an imploring voice  but i can t apologize  by god i can t  do what you will  how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness denisov began to laugh it ll be worse for you  bogdanich is vindictive and you ll pay for your obstinacy  said kirsten no  on my word it s not obstinacy  i can t describe the feeling  i can t well  it s as you like  said the staff captain  and what has become of that scoundrel  he asked denisov he has weported himself sick  he s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow muttered denisov it is an illness  there s no other way of explaining it  said the staff captain illness or not  he d better not cwoss my path  i d kill him  shouted denisov in a bloodthirsty tone just then zherkov entered the room what brings you here  cried the officers turning to the newcomer we re to go into action  gentlemen  mack has surrendered with his whole army it s not true i ve seen him myself what  saw the real mack  with hands and feet into action  into action  bring him a bottle for such news  but how did you come here i ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil  mack an austrian general complained of me  i congratulated him on mack s arrival  what s the matter  rostov  you look as if you d just come out of a hot bath oh  my dear fellow  we re in such a stew here these last two days the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by zherkov  they were under orders to advance next day we re going into action  gentlemen well  thank god  we ve been sitting here too long chapter vi kutuzov fell back toward vienna  destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn at braunau  and traun near linz  on october  the russian troops were crossing the river enns  at midday the russian baggage train  the artillery  and columns of troops were defiling through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge it was a warm  rainy  autumnal day  the wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain  and then  suddenly spread out in the sunlight  far distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished  down below  the little town could be seen with its white  red roofed houses  its cathedral  and its bridge  on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of russian troops  at the bend of the danube  vessels  an island and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube became visible  and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests  with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges  the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest  and far away on the other side of the enns the enemy s horse patrols could be discerned among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer  scanning the country through his fieldglass  a little behind them nesvitski  who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief  was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage  a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask  and nesvitski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkummel  the officers gladly gathered round him  some on their knees  some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass yes  the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool  it s a fine place  why are you not eating anything  gentlemen  nesvitski was saying thank you very much  prince  answered one of the officers  pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance  it s a lovely place we passed close to the park and saw two deer  and what a splendid house look  prince  said another  who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy  and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside see  our infantrymen have already got there  look there in the meadow behind the village  three of them are dragging something they ll ransack that castle  he remarked with evident approval so they will  said nesvitski  no  but what i should like  added he munching a pie in his moist lipped handsome mouth  would be to slip in over there he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery  and his eyes narrowed and gleamed that would be fine  gentlemen the officers laughed just to flutter the nuns a bit  they say there are italian girls among them  on my word i d give five years of my life for it they must be feeling dull  too  said one of the bolder officers laughing meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general  who looked through his field glass yes  so it is  so it is  said the general angrily  lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders  so it is  they ll be fired on at the crossing  and why are they dawdling there on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye  and from their battery a milk white cloud arose  then came the distant report of a shot  and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing nesvitski rose  puffing  and went up to the general  smiling would not your excellency like a little refreshment  he said it s a bad business  said the general without answering him  our men have been wasting time hadn t i better ride over  your excellency  asked nesvitski yes  please do  answered the general  and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail  and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered  and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected very good  answered nesvitski he called the cossack with his horse  told him to put away the knapsack and flask  and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle i ll really call in on the nuns  he said to the officers who watched him smilingly  and he rode off by the winding path down the hill now then  let s see how far it will carry  captain  just try  said the general  turning to an artillery officer  have a little fun to pass the time crew  to your guns  commanded the officer in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading one  came the command number one jumped briskly aside  the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar  and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy  a little smoke showing the spot where it burst the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound  everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below  as plainly visible as if but a stone s throw away  and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off  at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds  and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression chapter vii two of the enemy s shots had already flown across the bridge  where there was a crush  halfway across stood prince nesvitski  who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings  he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles  each time prince nesvitski tried to move on  soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings  and all he could do was to smile what a fine fellow you are  friend  said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon  who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses  what a fellow  you can t wait a moment  don t you see the general wants to pass but the convoyman took no notice of the word general  and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way  hi there  boys  keep to the left  wait a bit  but the soldiers  crowded together shoulder to shoulder  their bayonets interlocking  moved over the bridge in a dense mass  looking down over the rails prince nesvitski saw the rapid  noisy little waves of the enns  which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along  looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers  shoulder straps  covered shakos knapsacks  bayonets  long muskets  and  under the shakos  faces with broad cheekbones  sunken cheeks  and listless tired expressions  and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge  sometimes through the monotonous waves of men  like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns  an officer  in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men  squeezed his way along sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river  an hussar on foot an orderly  or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry  and sometimes like a log floating down the river  an officers  or company s baggage wagon  piled high  leather covered  and hemmed in on all sides moved across the bridge it s as if a dam had burst  said the cossack hopelessly  are there many more of you to come a million all but one  replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat  with a wink  and passed on followed by another  an old man if he  he meant the enemy  begins popping at the bridge now  said the old soldier dismally to a comrade  you ll forget to scratch yourself that soldier passed on  and after him came another sitting on a cart where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to  said an orderly running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it and he also passed on with the wagon  then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking and then  old fellow  he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun  a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily with a wide swing of his arm yes  the ham was just delicious  answered another with a loud laugh and they  too  passed on  so that nesvitski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth  or what the ham had to do with it bah  how they scurry  he just sends a ball and they think they ll all be killed  a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully as it flies past me  daddy  the ball i mean  said a young soldier with an enormous mouth  hardly refraining from laughing  i felt like dying of fright  i did  pon my word  i got that frightened  said he  as if bragging of having been frightened that one also passed  then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before  it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german  and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects  a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind  a woman with an unweaned baby  an old woman  and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds  evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission  the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women  and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers  remarks related to the two young ones  every face bore almost the same smile  expressing unseemly thoughts about the women just see  the german sausage is making tracks  too sell me the missis  said another soldier  addressing the german  who angry and frightened  strode energetically along with downcast eyes see how smart she s made herself  oh  the devils there  fedotov  you should be quartered on them i have seen as much before now  mate where are you going  asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple  also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl the german closed his eyes  signifying that he did not understand take it if you like  said the officer  giving the girl an apple the girl smiled and took it  nesvitski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed  when they had gone by  the same stream of soldiers followed  with the same kind of talk  and at last all stopped  as often happens  the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge  and the whole crowd had to wait and why are they stopping  there s no proper order  said the soldiers where are you shoving to  devil take you  can t you wait  it ll be worse if he fires the bridge  see  here s an officer jammed in too different voices were saying in the crowd  as the men looked at one another  and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge  nesvitski suddenly heard a sound new to him  of something swiftly approaching something big  that splashed into the water just see where it carries to  a soldier near by said sternly  looking round at the sound encouraging us to get along quicker  said another uneasily the crowd moved on again  nesvitski realized that it was a cannon ball hey  cossack  my horse  he said  now  then  you there  get out of the way  make way with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse  and shouting continually he moved on  the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him  but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg  and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind nesvitski  nesvitski  you numskull  came a hoarse voice from behind him nesvitski looked round and saw  some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry  vaska denisov  red and shaggy  with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder tell these devils  these fiends  to let me pass  shouted denisov evidently in a fit of rage  his coal black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face ah  vaska  joyfully replied nesvitski  what s up with you the squadwon can t pass  shouted vaska denisov  showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab  which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it  and snorted  spurting white foam from his bit  tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs  and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him  what is this  they re like sheep  just like sheep  out of the way  let us pass  stop there  you devil with the cart  i ll hack you with my saber  he shouted  actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces  and denisov joined nesvitski how s it you re not drunk today  said nesvitski when the other had ridden up to him they don t even give one time to dwink  answered vaska denisov  they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day  if they mean to fight let s fight  but the devil knows what this is what a dandy you are today  said nesvitski  looking at denisov s new cloak and saddlecloth denisov smiled  took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume  and put it to nesvitski s nose of course  i m going into action  i ve shaved  bwushed my teeth  and scented myself the imposing figure of nesvitski followed by his cossack  and the determination of denisov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically  had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry  beside the bridge nesvitski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order and having done this he rode back having cleared the way denisov stopped at the end of the bridge carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground  eager to rejoin its fellows  he watched his squadron draw nearer  then the clang of hoofs  as of several horses galloping resounded on the planks of the bridge  and the squadron  officers in front and men four abreast  spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill will estrangement  and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean  smart hussars who moved past them in regular order smart lads  only fit for a fair  said one what good are they  they re led about just for show  remarked another don t kick up the dust  you infantry  jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers i d like to put you on a two days  march with a knapsack  your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed  said an infantryman  wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve  perched up there  you re more like a bird than a man there now  zikin  they ought to put you on a horse  you d look fine said a corporal  chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack take a stick between your legs  that ll suit you for a horse  the hussar shouted back chapter viii the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge  squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel  at last the baggage wagons had all crossed  the crush was less  and the last battalion came onto the bridge  only denisov s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy  who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge  for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away  at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving  suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground  artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen  these were the french  a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot  all the officers and men of denisov s squadron  though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions  thought only of what was there on the hilltop  and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline  which they knew to be the enemy s troops  the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it  it was calm  and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill  there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers  an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them  the enemy ceased firing  and that stern  threatening  inaccessible  and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty  suffering  and death  and what is there  who is there there beyond that field  that tree  that roof lit up by the sun  no one knows  but one wants to know  you fear and yet long to cross that line  and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there  just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death  but you are strong  healthy  cheerful  and excited  and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men  so thinks  or at any rate feels anyone who comes in sight of the enemy  and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments on the high ground where the enemy was  the smoke of a cannon rose  and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron  the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places  the hussars began carefully aligning their horses  silence fell on the whole squadron  all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander  awaiting the word of command  a second and a third cannon ball flew past  evidently they were firing at the hussars  but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them  the hussars did not look round  but at the sound of each shot  as at the word of command  the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different  holding its breath while the ball flew past  rose in the stirrups and sank back again  the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another  curious to see their comrades  impression  every face  from denisov s to that of the bugler showed one common expression of conflict  irritation  and excitement around chin and mouth  the quartermaster frowned  looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them  cadet mironov ducked every time a ball flew past  rostov on the left flank  mounted on his rook a handsome horse despite its game leg had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself  he was glancing at everyone with a clear  bright expression  as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire  but despite himself  on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth who s that curtseying there  cadet miwonov  that s not wight  look at me  cried denisov who  unable to keep still on one spot  kept turning his horse in front of the squadron the black  hairy  snub nosed face of vaska denisov  and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber  looked just as it usually did especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle  he was only redder than usual  with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink  pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse  bedouin  and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols  he rode up to kirsten  the staff captain on his broad backed  steady mare came at a walk to meet him  his face with its long mustache was serious as always  only his eyes were brighter than usual well  what about it  said he to denisov  it won t come to a fight you ll see we shall retire the devil only knows what they re about  muttered denisov  ah wostov  he cried noticing the cadet s bright face  you ve got it at last and he smiled approvingly  evidently pleased with the cadet  rostov felt perfectly happy  just then the commander appeared on the bridge  denisov galloped up to him your excellency  let us attack them  i ll dwive them off attack indeed  said the colonel in a bored voice  puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly  and why are you stopping here  don t you see the skirmishers are retreating  lead the squadron back the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man  the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river the two pavlograd squadrons  having crossed the bridge  retired up the hill one after the other  their colonel  karl bogdanich schubert  came up to denisov s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostov without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyanin  rostov  feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame  did not lift his eyes from the colonel s athletic back  his nape covered with light hair  and his red neck  it seemed to rostov that bogdanich was only pretending not to notice him  and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet s courage so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily  then it seemed to him that bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage  next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him rostov  then he imagined how  after the attack bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation the high shouldered figure of zherkov  familiar to the pavlograds as he had but recently left their regiment  rode up to the colonel  after his dismissal from headquarters zherkov had not remained in the regiment saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff  and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagration  he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard colonel  he said  addressing rostov s enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades  there is an order to stop and fire the bridge an order to who  asked the colonel morosely i don t myself know to who  replied the cornet in a serious tone but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order  after him the stout nesvitski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight how s this  colonel  he shouted as he approached  i told you to fire the bridge  and now someone has gone and blundered  they are all beside themselves over there and one can t make anything out the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvitski you spoke to me of inflammable material  said he  but you said nothing about firing it but  my dear sir  said nesvitski as he drew up  taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand  wasn t i telling you to fire the bridge  when inflammable material had been put in position i am not your dear sir  mr  staff officer  and you did not tell me to burn the bridge  i know the service  and it is my habit orders strictly to obey  you said the bridge would be burned  but who would it burn  i could not know by the holy spirit ah  that s always the way  said nesvitski with a wave of the hand how did you get here  said he  turning to zherkov on the same business  but you are damp  let me wring you out you were saying  mr  staff officer  continued the colonel in an offended tone colonel  interrupted the officer of the suite  you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite  at the stout staff officer  and at zherkov  and he frowned i will the bridge fire  he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything  the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron  that in which rostov was serving under denisov  to return to the bridge there  it s just as i thought  said rostov to himself  he wishes to test me  his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face  let him see whether i am a coward  he thought again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire  rostov watched his enemy the colonel  closely to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture  but the colonel did not once glance at rostov  and looked as he always did when at the front  solemn and stern  then came the word of command look sharp  look sharp  several voices repeated around him their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling  the hussars hastily dismounted  not knowing what they were to do  the men were crossing themselves  rostov no longer looked at the colonel  he had no time  he was afraid of falling behind the hussars  so much afraid that his heart stood still  his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly s charge  and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud  denisov rode past him  leaning back and shouting something  rostov saw nothing but the hussars running all around him  their spurs catching and their sabers clattering stretchers  shouted someone behind him rostov did not think what this call for stretchers meant  he ran on trying only to be ahead of the others  but just at the bridge  not looking at the ground  he came on some sticky  trodden mud  stumbled and fell on his hands  the others outstripped him at boss zides  captain  he heard the voice of the colonel  who  having ridden ahead  had pulled up his horse near the bridge  with a triumphant  cheerful face rostov wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on  thinking that the farther he went to the front the better  but bogdanich  without looking at or recognizing rostov  shouted to him who s that running on the middle of the bridge  to the right  come back  cadet  he cried angrily  and turning to denisov  who  showing off his courage  had ridden on to the planks of the bridge why run risks  captain  you should dismount  he said oh  every bullet has its billet  answered vaska denisov  turning in his saddle meanwhile nesvitski  zherkov  and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots  watching  now the small group of men with yellow shakos  dark green jackets braided with cord  and blue riding breeches  who were swarming near the bridge  and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side the blue uniforms and groups with horses  easily recognizable as artillery will they burn the bridge or not  who ll get there first  will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out  these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns ugh  the hussars will get it hot  said nesvitski  they are within grapeshot range now he shouldn t have taken so many men  said the officer of the suite true enough  answered nesvitski  two smart fellows could have done the job just as well ah  your excellency  put in zherkov  his eyes fixed on the hussars but still with that naive air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest  ah  your excellency  how you look at things  send two men  and who then would give us the vladimir medal and ribbon  but now  even if they do get peppered  the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon  our bogdanich knows how things are done there now  said the officer of the suite  that s grapeshot he pointed to the french guns  the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed on the french side  amid the groups with cannon  a cloud of smoke appeared  then a second and a third almost simultaneously  and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen  then two reports one after another  and a third oh  oh  groaned nesvitski as if in fierce pain  seizing the officer of the suite by the arm  look  a man has fallen  fallen  fallen two  i think if i were tsar i would never go to war  said nesvitski  turning away the french guns were hastily reloaded  the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run  smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals  and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge  but this time nesvitski could not see what was happening there as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it  the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them  no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses  two were misdirected and the shot went too high  but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over rostov  absorbed by his relations with bogdanich  had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do  there was no one to hew down as he had always imagined battles to himself  nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers  he stood looking about him  when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt  and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan  rostov ran up to him with the others  again someone shouted  stretchers  four men seized the hussar and began lifting him oooh  for christ s sake let me alone  cried the wounded man  but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher nicholas rostov turned away and  as if searching for something  gazed into the distance  at the waters of the danube  at the sky  and at the sun  how beautiful the sky looked  how blue  how calm  and how deep  how bright and glorious was the setting sun  with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone  and fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river  the nunnery  the mysterious gorges  and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits  there was peace and happiness  i should wish for nothing else  nothing  if only i were there  thought rostov  in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness  but here  groans  suffering  fear  and this uncertainty and hurry  there they are shouting again  and again are all running back somewhere  and i shall run with them  and it  death  is here above me and around  another instant and i shall never again see the sun  this water  that gorge at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds  and other stretchers came into view before rostov  and the fear of death and of the stretchers  and love of the sun and of life  all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation o lord god  thou who art in that heaven  save  forgive  and protect me  rostov whispered the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses  their voices sounded louder and calmer  the stretchers disappeared from sight well  fwiend  so you ve smelt powdah  shouted vaska denisov just above his ear it s all over  but i am a coward yes  a coward  thought rostov  and sighing deeply he took rook  his horse  which stood resting one foot from the orderly and began to mount was that grapeshot  he asked denisov yes and no mistake  cried denisov  you worked like wegular bwicks and it s nasty work  an attack s pleasant work  hacking away at the dogs but this sort of thing is the very devil  with them shooting at you like a target and denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostov  composed of the colonel  nesvitski  zherkov  and the officer from the suite well  it seems that no one has noticed  thought rostov  and this was true  no one had taken any notice  for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced here s something for you to report  said zherkov  see if i don t get promoted to a sublieutenancy inform the prince that i the bridge fired  said the colonel triumphantly and gaily and if he asks about the losses a trifle  said the colonel in his bass voice  two hussars wounded and one knocked out  he added  unable to restrain a happy smile  and pronouncing the phrase knocked out  with ringing distinctness chapter ix pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte  encountering a population that was unfriendly to it losing confidence in its allies  suffering from shortness of supplies and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen  the russian army of thirty five thousand men commanded by kutuzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube  stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment there had been actions at lambach  amstetten  and melk  but despite the courage and endurance acknowledged even by the enemy with which the russians fought  the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat  austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutuzov at braunau now separated from the russian army  and kutuzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces  the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of  instead of an offensive  the plan of which  carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics  had been handed to kutuzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath  the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia  without losing his army as mack had done at ulm on the twenty eighth of october kutuzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french  on the thirtieth he attacked mortier s division  which was on the left bank and broke it up  in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners  cannon  and two enemy generals  for the first time  after a fortnight s retreat  the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french  though the troops were ill clad  exhausted  and had lost a third of their number in killed  wounded  sick  and stragglers  though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutuzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy  and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded  yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably  throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia  of some victory gained by the austrians  and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt  who was killed in the action  his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet  as a mark of the commander in chief s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court  now no longer at vienna which was threatened by the french  but at brunn  despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men  and on the night of the battle  having arrived at krems excited but not weary  with dispatches from dokhturov to kutuzov he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brunn  to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion the night was dark but starry  the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day the day of the battle  reviewing his impressions of the recent battle  picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create  or recalling the send off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers  prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long desired happiness  as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory  then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed  but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy  as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away  he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle  and feeling reassured he dozed off  the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning  the snow was thawing in the sunshine  the horses galloped quickly  and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds  fields  and villages at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded  the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart  shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse  in each of the long german carts six or more pale  dirty  bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road  some of them were talking he heard russian words  others were eating bread  the more severely wounded looked silently  with the languid interest of sick children  at the envoy hurrying past them prince andrew told his driver to stop  and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded  day before yesterday  on the danube answered the soldier  prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces that s for them all  he said to the officer who came up get well soon  lads  he continued  turning to the soldiers  there s plenty to do still what news  sir  asked the officer  evidently anxious to start a conversation good news  go on  he shouted to the driver  and they galloped on it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings  the lights of shops  houses  and street lamps  fine carriages  and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life  despite his rapid journey and sleepless night prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before  only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity  he again vividly recalled the details of the battle  no longer dim  but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis  he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give  he expected to be at once presented to the emperor  at the chief entrance to the palace  however  an official came running out to meet him  and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance to the right from the corridor  euer hochgeboren  there you will find the adjutant on duty  said the official  he will conduct you to the minister of war the adjutant on duty  meeting prince andrew  asked him to wait  and went in to the minister of war  five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work  the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger prince andrew s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister s room  he felt offended  and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for  his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister  away from the smell of powder  they probably think it easy to gain victories  he thought  his eyes narrowed disdainfully  he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps  this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them  and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival  a wax candle stood at each side of the minister s bent bald head with its gray temples  he went on reading to the end  without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps take this and deliver it  said he to his adjutant  handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutuzov s army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with  or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression  but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me  he thought  the minister drew the remaining papers together  arranged them evenly  and then raised his head  he had an intellectual and distinctive head  but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm  intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him  his face took on the stupid artificial smile which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality  of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another from general field marshal kutuzov  he asked  i hope it is good news there has been an encounter with mortier  a victory  it was high time he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression oh  my god  my god  schmidt  he exclaimed in german  what a calamity what a calamity having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew  evidently considering something ah what a calamity  you say the affair was decisive  but mortier is not captured  again he pondered  i am very glad you have brought good news  though schmidt s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory his majesty will no doubt wish to see you  but not today  i thank you you must have a rest  be at the levee tomorrow after the parade however  i will let you know the stupid smile  which had left his face while he was speaking reappeared au revoir  thank you very much  his majesty will probably desire to see you  he added  bowing his head when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant  the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed  the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past chapter x prince andrew stayed at brunn with bilibin  a russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service ah  my dear prince  i could not have a more welcome visitor  said bilibin as he came out to meet prince andrew  franz  put the prince s things in my bedroom  said he to the servant who was ushering bolkonski in  so you re a messenger of victory  eh  splendid  and i am sitting here ill  as you see after washing and dressing  prince andrew came into the diplomat s luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him  bilibin settled down comfortably beside the fire after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life  prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood  besides it was pleasant after his reception by the austrians  to speak if not in russian for they were speaking french  at least with a russian who would  he supposed  share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was then particularly strong bilibin was a man of thirty five  a bachelor  and of the same circle as prince andrew  they had known each other previously in petersburg  but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutuzov just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession  so to an even greater extent bilibin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career  he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat  as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen  had been in paris and copenhagen  and now held a rather important post in vienna  both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him  he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities avoid doing certain things  and speak french  he was one of those  who liking work  knew how to do it  and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table  he worked well whatever the import of his work  it was not the question what for  but the question how  that interested him  what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care  but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular  memorandum  or report  skillfully  pointedly  and elegantly bilibin s services were valued not only for what he wrote  but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres bilibin liked conversation as he liked work  only when it could be made elegantly witty  in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible  his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original finished phrases of general interest  these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally  so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room  and  in fact  bilibin s witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important his thin  worn  sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles  which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one s fingers after a russian bath  the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face  now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted  then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks  his small  deep set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight well  now tell me about your exploits  said he bolkonski  very modestly without once mentioning himself  described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles  said he in conclusion bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared cependant  mon cher  he remarked  examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye  malgre la haute estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army  j avoue que votre victoire n est pas des plus victorieuses   but my dear fellow  with all my respect for the orthodox russian army  i must say that your victory was not particularly victorious he went on talking in this way in french  uttering only those words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis come now  you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division  and even then mortier slips through your fingers where s the victory but seriously  said prince andrew  we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm why didn t you capture one  just one  marshal for us because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade  we had expected  as i told you  to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon and why didn t you do it at seven in the morning  you ought to have been there at seven in the morning  returned bilibin with a smile  you ought to have been there at seven in the morning why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave genoa alone  retorted prince andrew in the same tone i know  interrupted bilibin  you re thinking it s very easy to take marshals  sitting on a sofa by the fire  that is true  but still why didn t you capture him  so don t be surprised if not only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is not much delighted by your victory  even i  a poor secretary of the russian embassy  do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my franz a thaler  or let him go with his liebchen to the prater  true we have no prater here he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead it is now my turn to ask you why  mon cher  said bolkonski  i confess i do not understand  perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence  but i can t make it out  mack loses a whole army  the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder  kutuzov alone at last gains a real victory  destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french and the minister of war does not even care to hear the details that s just it  my dear fellow  you see it s hurrah for the tsar  for russia  for the orthodox greek faith  all that is beautiful  but what do we  i mean the austrian court  care for your victories  bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand one archduke s as good as another  as you know  and even if it is only over a fire brigade of bonaparte s  that will be another story and we ll fire off some cannon  but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us  the archduke karl does nothing  the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself you abandon vienna  give up its defense as much as to say  heaven is with us  but heaven help you and your capital  the one general whom we all loved  schmidt  you expose to a bullet  and then you congratulate us on the victory  admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived  it s as if it had been done on purpose  on purpose besides  suppose you did gain a brilliant victory  if even the archduke karl gained a victory  what effect would that have on the general course of events  it s too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army what  occupied  vienna occupied not only occupied  but bonaparte is at schonbrunn  and the count  our dear count vrbna  goes to him for orders after the fatigues and impressions of the journey  his reception  and especially after having dined  bolkonski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard count lichtenfels was here this morning  bilibin continued  and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described  prince murat et tout le tremblement  you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can t be received as a savior really i don t care about that  i don t care at all  said prince andrew  beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of austria s capital  how is it vienna was taken  what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg  we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna  he said prince auersperg is on this  on our side of the river  and is defending us doing it very badly  i think  but still he is defending us  but vienna is on the other side  no  the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be  for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up  otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia  and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires but still this does not mean that the campaign is over  said prince andrew well  i think it is  the bigwigs here think so too  but they daren t say so  it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign  it won t be your skirmishing at durrenstein  or gunpowder at all  that will decide the matter  but those who devised it  said bilibin quoting one of his own mots  releasing the wrinkles on his forehead  and pausing the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin  if prussia joins the allies  austria s hand will be forced and there will be war  if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn up what an extraordinary genius  prince andrew suddenly exclaimed clenching his small hand and striking the table with it  and what luck the man has buonaparte  said bilibin inquiringly  puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty  buonaparte  he repeated  accentuating the u  i think  however  now that he lays down laws for austria at schonbrunn  il faut lui faire grace de l u   i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte  we must let him off the u but joking apart  said prince andrew  do you really think the campaign is over this is what i think  austria has been made a fool of  and she is not used to it  she will retaliate  and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged they say the holy russian army loots terribly her army is destroyed  her capital taken and all this for the beaux yeux  of his sardinian majesty  and therefore this is between ourselves i instinctively feel that we are being deceived  my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace  a secret peace concluded separately  fine eyes impossible  cried prince andrew  that would be too base if we live we shall see  replied bilibin  his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows  he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far  far away from him  the alliance with prussia  austria s treachery  bonaparte s new triumph  tomorrow s levee and parade  and the audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts he closed his eyes  and immediately a sound of cannonading  of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears  and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill the french were firing  and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around and he experienced tenfold the joy of living  as he had not done since childhood he woke up yes  that all happened  he said  and  smiling happily to himself like a child  he fell into a deep  youthful slumber chapter xi next day he woke late  recalling his recent impressions  the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francis  he remembered the minister of war  the polite austrian adjutant  bilibin  and last night s conversation  having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform  which he had not worn for a long time  he went into bilibin s study fresh  animated and handsome  with his hand bandaged  in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps  with prince hippolyte kuragin  who was a secretary to the embassy  bolkonski was already acquainted  bilibin introduced him to the others the gentlemen assembled at bilibin s were young  wealthy  gay society men  who here  as in vienna  formed a special set which bilibin  their leader  called les notres   this set  consisting almost exclusively of diplomats  evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society  to certain women  and to the official side of the service  these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves  an honor they did not extend to many  from politeness and to start conversation  they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle  and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip  ours but the best of it was  said one  telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat  that the chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it can you fancy the figure he cut but the worst of it  gentlemen i am giving kuragin away to you is that that man suffers  and this don juan  wicked fellow  is taking advantage of it prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm  he began to laugh tell me about that  he said oh  you don juan  you serpent  cried several voices you  bolkonski  don t know  said bilibin turning to prince andrew that all the atrocities of the french army i nearly said of the russian army  are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women la femme est la compagne de l homme   announced prince hippolyte  and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs  woman is man s companion bilibin and the rest of ours  burst out laughing in hippolyte s face and prince andrew saw that hippolyte  of whom he had to admit he had almost been jealous on his wife s account  was the butt of this set oh  i must give you a treat  bilibin whispered to bolkonski  kuragin is exquisite when he discusses politics you should see his gravity he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics  prince andrew and the others gathered round these two the berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance  began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others  without expressing  as in its last note  you understand  besides  unless his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance wait  i have not finished  he said to prince andrew  seizing him by the arm  i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention  and  he paused  finally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november  that is how it will end  and he released bolkonski s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished demosthenes  i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth  said bilibin  and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction everybody laughed  and hippolyte louder than anyone  he was evidently distressed  and breathed painfully  but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features well now  gentlemen  said bilibin  bolkonski is my guest in this house and in brunn itself  i want to entertain him as far as i can  with all the pleasures of life here  if we were in vienna it would be easy but here  in this wretched moravian hole  it is more difficult  and i beg you all to help me  brunn s attractions must be shown him  you can undertake the theater  i society  and you  hippolyte  of course the women we must let him see amelie  she s exquisite  said one of ours kissing his finger tips in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests  said bilibin i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality gentlemen  it is already time for me to go  replied prince andrew looking at his watch where to to the emperor oh  oh  oh  well  au revoir  bolkonski  au revoir  prince  come back early to dinner  cried several voices  we ll take you in hand when speaking to the emperor  try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated  said bilibin accompanying him to the hall i should like to speak well of them  but as far as i know the facts  i can t  replied bolkonski  smiling well  talk as much as you can  anyway  he has a passion for giving audiences  but he does not like talking himself and can t do it  as you will see chapter xii at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to  and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head  but after it was over the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkonski that the emperor desired to give him an audience  the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room  before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say tell me  when did the battle begin  he asked hurriedly prince andrew replied  then followed other questions just as simple was kutuzov well  when had he left krems  and so on  the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions the answers to these questions  as was only too evident  did not interest him at what o clock did the battle begin  asked the emperor i cannot inform your majesty at what o clock the battle began at the front  but at durrenstein  where i was  our attack began after five in the afternoon  replied bolkonski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account  which he had ready in his mind  of all he knew and had seen  but the emperor smiled and interrupted him how many miles from where to where  your majesty from durrenstein to krems three and a half miles  your majesty the french have abandoned the left bank according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night is there sufficient forage in krems forage has not been supplied to the extent the emperor interrupted him at what o clock was general schmidt killed at seven o clock  i believe at seven o clock  it s very sad  very sad the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed  prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides  everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words  yesterday s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace  and offered him his own house the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade  which the emperor was conferring on him  the empress  chamberlain invited him to see her majesty  the archduchess also wished to see him  he did not know whom to answer  and for a few seconds collected his thoughts  then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder  led him to the window  and began to talk to him contrary to bilibin s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received  a thanksgiving service was arranged  kutuzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa  and the whole army received rewards bolkonski was invited everywhere  and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries  between four and five in the afternoon  having made all his calls  he was returning to bilibin s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brunn  at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage  franz bilibin s man  was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door before returning to bilibin s prince andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign  and had spent some time in the shop what is it  he asked oh  your excellency  said franz  with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle  we are to move on still farther  the scoundrel is again at our heels eh  what  asked prince andrew bilibin came out to meet him  his usually calm face showed excitement there now  confess that this is delightful  said he  this affair of the thabor bridge  at vienna  they have crossed without striking a blow prince andrew could not understand but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows i come from the archduchess  i heard nothing there and you didn t see that everybody is packing up i did not  what is it all about  inquired prince andrew impatiently what s it all about  why  the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending  and the bridge was not blown up  so murat is now rushing along the road to brunn and will be here in a day or two what  here  but why did they not blow up the bridge  if it was mined that is what i ask you  no one  not even bonaparte  knows why bolkonski shrugged his shoulders but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost  it will be cut off  said he that s
