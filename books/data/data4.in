 would have rescued her from the fire  but this is a monster and neither a man nor a father  you  honored sir  are a noble man  she went on addressing pierre rapidly between her sobs  the fire broke out alongside  and blew our way  the maid called out fire  and we rushed to collect our things  we ran out just as we were  this is what we have brought away  the icons  and my dowry bed  all the rest is lost we seized the children  but not katie  ooh  o lord  and again she began to sob  my child  my dear one  burned  burned but where was she left  asked pierre from the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her oh  dear sir  she cried  seizing him by the legs  my benefactor  set my heart at ease  aniska  go  you horrid girl  show him the way  she cried to the maid  angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth show me the way  show me  i  i ll do it  gasped pierre rapidly the dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk  put up her plait sighed  and went on her short  bare feet along the path  pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon  he held his head higher  his eyes shone with the light of life  and with swift steps he followed the maid  overtook her  and came out on the povarskoy  the whole street was full of clouds of black smoke  tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud  a great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration  in the middle of the street stood a french general saying something to those around him  pierre  accompanied by the maid  was advancing to the spot where the general stood  but the french soldiers stopped him on ne passe pas   cried a voice  you can t pass this way  uncle  cried the girl  we ll pass through the side street by the nikulins pierre turned back  giving a spring now and then to keep up with her she ran across the street  turned down a side street to the left  and passing three houses  turned into a yard on the right it s here  close by  said she and  running across the yard  opened a gate in a wooden fence and  stopping  pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house  which was burning brightly and fiercely  one of its sides had fallen in  another was on fire  and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof as pierre passed through the fence gate  he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped which is it  which is your house  he asked ooh  wailed the girl  pointing to the wing  that s it  that was our lodging  you ve burned to death  our treasure  katie  my precious little missy  ooh  lamented aniska  who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings pierre rushed to the wing  but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end  just below the roof  and around which swarmed a crowd of frenchmen  at first pierre did not realize what these men  who were dragging something out  were about  but seeing before him a frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox fur coat  he vaguely understood that looting was going on there  but he had no time to dwell on that idea the sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings  the whistle and hiss of the flames  the excited shouts of the people  and the sight of the swaying smoke  now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks  with here and there dense sheaves of flame now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls  and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion  produced on pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration  it had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down  he felt young  bright  adroit  and resolute  he ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing  when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him pierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest  filled with metal articles  other french soldiers standing below went up to the drawer what does this fellow want  shouted one of them referring to pierre there s a child in that house  haven t you seen a child  cried pierre what s he talking about  get along  said several voices  and one of the soldiers  evidently afraid that pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer  moved threateningly toward him a child  shouted a frenchman from above  i did hear something squealing in the garden  perhaps it s his brat that the fellow is looking for  after all  one must be human  you know where is it  where  said pierre there  there  shouted the frenchman at the window  pointing to the garden at the back of the house  wait a bit i m coming down and a minute or two later the frenchman  a black eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek  in shirt sleeves  really did jump out of a window on the ground floor  and clapping pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden hurry up  you others  he called out to his comrades  it s getting hot when they reached a gravel path behind the house the frenchman pulled pierre by the arm and pointed to a round  graveled space where a three year old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat there is your child  oh  a girl  so much the better  said the frenchman  good bye  fatty  we must be human  we are all mortal you know  and the frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades breathless with joy  pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms  but seeing a stranger the sickly  scrofulous looking child  unattractively like her mother  began to yell and run away pierre  however  seized her and lifted her in his arms  she screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull pierre s hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth  pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal  but he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house  it was now  however impossible to get back the way he had come  the maid  aniska  was no longer there  and pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet  painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out chapter xxxiv having run through different yards and side streets  pierre got back with his little burden to the gruzinski garden at the corner of the povarskoy  he did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child  so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses  besides russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings  there were several french soldiers in a variety of clothing  pierre took no notice of them  he hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else  pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly  glowing with the heat and from running  he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth  animation  and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child  she had now become quiet and  clinging with her little hands to pierre s coat  sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal  he glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile  he fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened  sickly little face he did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them  he walked among the crowd with rapid steps  scanning the various faces he met  involuntarily he noticed a georgian or armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of oriental type  wearing a new  cloth covered  sheepskin coat and new boots  an old woman of similar type  and a young woman  that very young woman seemed to pierre the perfection of oriental beauty  with her sharply outlined  arched  black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft  bright color of her long  beautiful expressionless face  amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space  she  in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head  suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow she was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman  and looked from under her long lashes with motionless  large  almond shaped eyes at the ground before her  evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it  her face struck pierre and  hurrying along by the fence  he turned several times to look at her  when he had reached the fence  still without finding those he sought  he stopped and looked about him with the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before  and a group of russians  both men and women  gathered about him have you lost anyone  my dear fellow  you re of the gentry yourself aren t you  whose child is it  they asked him pierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children  and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone why  that must be the anferovs  said an old deacon  addressing a pockmarked peasant woman  lord have mercy  lord have mercy  he added in his customary bass the anferovs  no  said the woman  they left in the morning  that must be either mary nikolievna s or the ivanovs he says a woman  and mary nikolievna is a lady  remarked a house serf do you know her  she s thin  with long teeth  said pierre that s mary nikolievna  they went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down  said the woman  pointing to the french soldiers o lord  have mercy  added the deacon go over that way  they re there  it s she  she kept on lamenting and crying  continued the woman  it s she  here  this way but pierre was not listening to the woman  he had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away  he was looking at the armenian family and at two french soldiers who had gone up to them one of these  a nimble little man  was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope  he had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare  the other  whose appearance particularly struck pierre  was a long  lank  round shouldered  fair haired man  slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face  he wore a woman s loose gown of frieze  blue trousers  and large torn hessian boots  the little barefooted frenchman in the blue coat went up to the armenians and saying something  immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots  the other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her  motionless and silent here  take the child  said pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman  handing the little girl to her  give her back to them  give her back  he almost shouted  putting the child  who began screaming  on the ground  and again looking at the frenchman and the armenian family the old man was already sitting barefoot  the little frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other  the old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs  but pierre caught but a glimpse of this  his whole attention was directed to the frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile  swaying slowly from side to side  had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck the beautiful armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her while pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the frenchman  the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young armenian was wearing  and the young woman  clutching at her neck  screamed piercingly let that woman alone  exclaimed pierre hoarsely in a furious voice seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside the soldier fell  got up  and ran away  but his comrade  throwing down the boots and drawing his sword  moved threateningly toward pierre voyons  pas de betises   he cried  look here  no nonsense pierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold  he rushed at the barefooted frenchman and  before the latter had time to draw his sword  knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists  shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around  and at the same moment a mounted patrol of french uhlans appeared from round the corner  the uhlans came up at a trot to pierre and the frenchman and surrounded them  pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that  he only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of french soldiers stood around him and were searching him lieutenant  he has a dagger  were the first words pierre understood ah  a weapon  said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with pierre  all right  you can tell all about it at the court martial  then he turned to pierre  do you speak french pierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply  his face probably looked very terrible  for the officer said something in a whisper and four more uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of pierre do you speak french  the officer asked again  keeping at a distance from pierre  call the interpreter a little man in russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks  and by his clothes and manner of speaking pierre at once knew him to be a french salesman from one of the moscow shops he does not look like a common man  said the interpreter  after a searching look at pierre ah  he looks very much like an incendiary  remarked the officer  and ask him who he is  he added who are you  asked the interpreter in poor russian  you must answer the chief i will not tell you who i am  i am your prisoner take me  pierre suddenly replied in french ah  ah  muttered the officer with a frown  well then  march a crowd had collected round the uhlans  nearest to pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl  and when the patrol started she moved forward where are they taking you to  you poor dear  said she  and the little girl  the little girl  what am i to do with her if she s not theirs said the woman what does that woman want  asked the officer pierre was as if intoxicated  his elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved what does she want  he murmured  she is bringing me my daughter whom i have just saved from the flames  said he  good bye  and without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him  he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the french soldiers the french patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of moscow by durosnel s order to put a stop to the pillage  and especially to catch the incendiaries who  according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher french officers were the cause of the conflagrations  after marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more russian suspects  a small shopkeeper  two seminary students  a peasant  and a house serf  besides several looters  but of all these various suspected characters  pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all  when they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the zubov rampart that was being used as a guardhouse  pierre was placed apart under strict guard book twelve  chapter i in petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles  between the parties of rumyantsev  the french  marya fedorovna  the tsarevich  and others drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones  but the calm luxurious life of petersburg  concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life  went on in its old way and made it hard except by a great effort  to realize the danger and the difficult position of the russian people  there were the same receptions and balls  the same french theater  the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual  only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position stories were whispered of how differently the two empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances  the empress marya  concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage  had given directions that they should all be removed to kazan  and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up  the empress elisabeth  however  when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give with her characteristic russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign  but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit petersburg at anna pavlovna s on the twenty sixth of august  the very day of the battle of borodino  there was a soiree  the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from his lordship the bishop when sending the emperor an icon of the venerable sergius  it was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical  patriotic eloquence  prince vasili himself  famed for his elocution  was to read it  he used to read at the empress  the art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words  quite independently of their meaning  in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur  so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another  this reading  as was always the case at anna pavlovna s soirees  had a political significance  that evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the french theater and aroused to a patriotic temper  a good many people had already arrived  but anna pavlovna  not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation the news of the day in petersburg was the illness of countess bezukhova she had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously  had missed several gatherings of which she was usually ornament  and was said to be receiving no one  and instead of the celebrated petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way they all knew very well that the enchanting countess  illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time and that the italian s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience but in anna pavlovna s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it they say the poor countess is very ill  the doctor says it is angina pectoris angina  oh  that s a terrible illness they say that the rivals are reconciled  thanks to the angina  and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction the count is pathetic  they say  he cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous oh  it would be a terrible loss  she is an enchanting woman you are speaking of the poor countess  said anna pavlovna  coming up just then  i sent to ask for news  and hear that she is a little better  oh  she is certainly the most charming woman in the world  she went on  with a smile at her own enthusiasm  we belong to different camps  but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves  she is very unfortunate  added anna pavlovna supposing that by these words anna pavlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess  malady  an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well known doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies your information may be better than mine  anna pavlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man  but i know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man  he is private physician to the queen of spain and having thus demolished the young man  anna pavlovna turned to another group where bilibin was talking about the austrians  having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots i think it is delightful  he said  referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to vienna with some austrian banners captured from the french by wittgenstein  the hero of petropol  as he was then called in petersburg what  what s that  asked anna pavlovna  securing silence for the mot which she had heard before and bilibin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch  which he had himself composed the emperor returns these austrian banners  said bilibin  friendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path  and his brow became smooth again charming  charming  observed prince vasili the path to warsaw  perhaps  prince hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly  everybody looked at him  understanding what he meant prince hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise  he knew no more than the others what his words meant  during his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty  and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head  it may turn out very well  he thought  but if not  they ll know how to arrange matters  and really  during the awkward silence that ensued  that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom anna pavlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert and she  smiling and shaking a finger at hippolyte  invited prince vasili to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin  everyone became silent most gracious sovereign and emperor  prince vasili sternly declaimed looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary  but no one said anything  moscow  our ancient capital  the new jerusalem  receives her christ he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her as a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms  and through the gathering mists  foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule  sings in exultation  hosanna  blessed is he that cometh prince vasili pronounced these last words in a tearful voice bilibin attentively examined his nails  and many of those present appeared intimidated  as if asking in what they were to blame  anna pavlovna whispered the next words in advance  like an old woman muttering the prayer at communion  let the bold and insolent goliath  she whispered prince vasili continued let the bold and insolent goliath from the borders of france encompass the realms of russia with death bearing terrors  humble faith  the sling of the russian david  shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty pride  this icon of the venerable sergius  the servant of god and zealous champion of old of our country s weal  is offered to your imperial majesty  i grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence  i raise fervent prayers to heaven that the almighty may exalt the race of the just  and mercifully fulfill the desires of your majesty what force  what a style  was uttered in approval both of reader and of author animated by that address anna pavlovna s guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days you will see  said anna pavlovna  that tomorrow  on the emperor s birthday  we shall receive news  i have a favorable presentiment chapter ii anna pavlovna s presentiment was in fact fulfilled  next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the emperor s birthday  prince volkonski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from prince kutuzov  it was kutuzov s report  written from tatarinova on the day of the battle  kutuzov wrote that the russians had not retreated a step  that the french losses were much heavier than ours  and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information  it followed that there must have been a victory  and at once  without leaving the church  thanks were rendered to the creator for his help and for the victory anna pavlovna s presentiment was justified  and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city  everyone believed the victory to have been complete  and some even spoke of napoleon s having been captured  of his deposition  and of the choice of a new ruler for france it is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action  general events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident  so now the courtiers  pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the emperor s birthday as on the fact of the victory itself  it was like a successfully arranged surprise  mention was made in kutuzov s report of the russian losses among which figured the names of tuchkov  bagration  and kutaysov  in the petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident  kutaysov s death  everybody knew him the emperor liked him  and he was young and interesting  that day everyone met with the words what a wonderful coincidence  just during the service  but what a loss kutaysov is  how sorry i am what did i tell about kutuzov  prince vasili now said with a prophet s pride  i always said he was the only man capable of defeating napoleon but next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious  the courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the emperor fancy the emperor s position  said they  and instead of extolling kutuzov as they had done the day before  they condemned him as the cause of the emperor s anxiety  that day prince vasili no longer boasted of his protege kutuzov  but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned  moreover  toward evening  as if everything conspired to make petersburg society anxious and uneasy  a terrible piece of news was added  countess helene bezukhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention  officially  at large gatherings  everyone said that countess bezukhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris  but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the queen of spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect but helene  tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written that wretched  profligate pierre  had not replied  had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug  and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her  it was said that prince vasili and the old count had turned upon the italian  but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop talk in general centered round three melancholy facts  the emperor s lack of news  the loss of kutaysov  and the death of helene on the third day after kutuzov s report a country gentleman arrived from moscow  and news of the surrender of moscow to the french spread through the whole town  this was terrible  what a position for the emperor to be in  kutuzov was a traitor  and prince vasili during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter s death said of kutuzov  whom he had formerly praised it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said  that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man i only wonder that the fate of russia could have been entrusted to such a man as long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it but the next day the following communication was received from count rostopchin prince kutuzov s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the ryazan road  he writes that he is regretfully abandoning moscow  sire  kutuzov s action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire  russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors  i shall follow the army  i have had everything removed  and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland on receiving this dispatch the emperor sent prince volkonski to kutuzov with the following rescript prince michael ilarionovich  since the twenty ninth of august i have received no communication from you  yet on the first of september i received from the commander in chief of moscow  via yaroslavl  the sad news that you  with the army  have decided to abandon moscow  you can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me  and your silence increases my astonishment  i am sending this by adjutant general prince volkonski  to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision chapter iii nine days after the abandonment of moscow  a messenger from kutuzov reached petersburg with the official announcement of that event  this messenger was michaud  a frenchman who did not know russian  but who was quoique etranger  russe de coeur et d ame   as he said of himself  though a foreigner  russian in heart and soul the emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on stone island  michaud  who had never seen moscow before the campaign and who did not know russian  yet felt deeply moved as he wrote  when he appeared before notre tres gracieux souverain  with the news of the burning of moscow  dont les flammes eclairaient sa route   our most gracious sovereign   whose flames illumined his route though the source of m  michaud s chagrin must have been different from that which caused russians to grieve  he had such a sad face when shown into the emperor s study that the latter at once asked have you brought me sad news  colonel very sad  sire  replied michaud  lowering his eyes with a sigh  the abandonment of moscow have they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle  asked the emperor quickly  his face suddenly flushing michaud respectfully delivered the message kutuzov had entrusted to him which was that it had been impossible to fight before moscow  and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as moscow  or losing moscow alone  the field marshal had to choose the latter the emperor listened in silence  not looking at michaud has the enemy entered the city  he asked yes  sire  and moscow is now in ashes  i left it all in flames replied michaud in a decided tone  but glancing at the emperor he was frightened by what he had done the emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly  his lower lip trembled  and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes but this lasted only a moment  he suddenly frowned  as if blaming himself for his weakness  and raising his head addressed michaud in a firm voice i see  colonel  from all that is happening  that providence requires great sacrifices of us  i am ready to submit myself in all things to his will  but tell me  michaud  how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle  did you not notice discouragement seeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more  michaud also grew calm  but was not immediately ready to reply to the emperor s direct and relevant question which required a direct answer sire  will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier  he asked to gain time colonel  i always require it  replied the emperor  conceal nothing from me  i wish to know absolutely how things are sire  said michaud with a subtle  scarcely perceptible smile on his lips  having now prepared a well phrased reply  sire  i left the whole army  from its chiefs to the lowest soldier  without exception in desperate and agonized terror how is that  the emperor interrupted him  frowning sternly  would misfortune make my russians lose heart  never michaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared sire  he said  with respectful playfulness  they are only afraid lest your majesty  in the goodness of your heart  should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace  they are burning for the combat  declared this representative of the russian nation  and to prove to your majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are ah  said the emperor reassured  and with a kindly gleam in his eyes he patted michaud on the shoulder  you set me at ease  colonel he bent his head and was silent for some time well  then  go back to the army  he said  drawing himself up to his full height and addressing michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture and tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when i have not a soldier left i shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire  it still offers me more than my enemies suppose  said the emperor growing more and more animated  but should it ever be ordained by divine providence  he continued  raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion  that my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors  then after exhausting all the means at my command  i shall let my beard grow to here  he pointed halfway down his chest  and go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants  rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices i know how to appreciate having uttered these words in an agitated voice the emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from michaud the tears that rose to his eyes and went to the further end of his study  having stood there a few moments  he strode back to michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement  the emperor s mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger colonel michaud  do not forget what i say to you here  perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday  napoleon or i  said the emperor touching his breast  we can no longer both reign together  i have learned to know him  and he will not deceive me any more and the emperor paused  with a frown when he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the emperor s eyes  michaud quoique etranger  russe de coeur et d ame at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard as he used afterwards to say  and gave expression to his own feelings and those of the russian people whose representative he considered himself to be  in the following words sire  said he  your majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of europe with an inclination of the head the emperor dismissed him chapter iv it is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces  and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland  all russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves  saving their fatherland or weeping over its downfall  the tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the self sacrifice  patriotic devotion despair  grief  and the heroism of the russians  but it was not really so  it appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had  yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed  most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests  and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful those who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society  they saw everything upside down  and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish like pierre s and mamonov s regiments which looted russian villages  and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded  and so on even those  fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings who discussed russia s position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of  in historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge is specially applicable  only unconscious action bears fruit  and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance  if he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless the more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in russia the less did he realize their significance  in petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from moscow  ladies  and gentlemen in militia uniforms  wept for russia and its ancient capital and talked of self sacrifice and so on  but in the army which retired beyond moscow there was little talk or thought of moscow  and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the french  but they thought about their next pay  their next quarters  of matreshka the vivandiere  and like matters as the war had caught him in the service  nicholas rostov took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country  but did so casually without any aim at self sacrifice  and he therefore looked at what was going on in russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it  had he been asked what he thought of the state of russia  he would have said that it was not his business to think about it  that kutuzov and others were there for that purpose  but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength  that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet  and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years  time as he looked at the matter in this way  he learned that he was being sent to voronezh to buy remounts for his division  not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle  but with the greatest pleasure which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood a few days before the battle of borodino  nicholas received the necessary money and warrants  and having sent some hussars on in advance  he set out with post horses for voronezh only a man who has experienced it that is  has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war can understand the delight nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the army s foraging operations  provision trains  and hospitals  when free from soldiers  wagons  and the filthy traces of a camp he saw villages with peasants and peasant women  gentlemen s country houses  fields where cattle were grazing  posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them  he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time  what for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women  young and healthy  without a dozen officers making up to each of them  women too  who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them in the highest spirits nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in voronezh ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp  and next day  very clean shaven and in a full dress uniform he had not worn for a long time  went to present himself to the authorities the commander of the militia was a civilian general  an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank  he received nicholas brusquely imagining this to be characteristically military and questioned him with an important air  as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so  nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him from the commander of the militia he drove to the governor  the governor was a brisk little man  very simple and affable  he indicated the stud farms at which nicholas might procure horses  recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses  and promised to assist him in every way you are count ilya rostov s son  my wife was a great friend of your mother s  we are at home on thursdays today is thursday  so please come and see us quite informally  said the governor  taking leave of him immediately on leaving the governor s  nicholas hired post horses and taking his squadron quartermaster with him  drove at a gallop to the landowner  fourteen miles away  who had the stud  everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in voronezh and  as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind everything went well and easily the landowner to whom nicholas went was a bachelor  an old cavalryman  a horse fancier  a sportsman  the possessor of some century old brandy and some old hungarian wine  who had a snuggery where he smoked  and who owned some splendid horses in very few words nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles to serve  as he said  as samples of his remounts  after dining and taking rather too much of the hungarian wine  nicholas having exchanged kisses with the landowner  with whom he was already on the friendliest terms galloped back over abominable roads  in the brightest frame of mind  continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor s party when he had changed  poured water over his head  and scented himself nicholas arrived at the governor s rather late  but with the phrase better late than never  on his lips it was not a ball  nor had dancing been announced  but everyone knew that catherine petrovna would play valses and the ecossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing  and so everyone had come as to a ball provincial life in  went on very much as usual  but with this difference  that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from moscow  and as in everything that went on in russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable  an in for a penny  in for a pound who cares  spirit  and the inevitable small talk  instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances now turned on moscow  the army  and napoleon the society gathered together at the governor s was the best in voronezh there were a great many ladies and some of nicholas  moscow acquaintances  but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of st  george  the hussar remount officer  the good natured and well bred count rostov  among the men was an italian prisoner  an officer of the french army  and nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a russian hero  the italian was as it were  a war trophy  nicholas felt this  it seemed to him that everyone regarded the italian in the same light  and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint as soon as nicholas entered in his hussar uniform  diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine  and had uttered the words better late than never  and heard them repeated several times by others  people clustered around him  all eyes turned on him  and he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the province that of a universal favorite  a very pleasant position  and intoxicatingly so after his long privations  at posting stations  at inns  and in the landowner s snuggery  maidservants had been flattered by his notice  and here too at the governor s party there were as it seemed to nicholas an inexhaustible number of pretty young women  married and unmarried impatiently awaiting his notice  the women and girls flirted with him and  from the first day  the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down  among these was the governor s wife herself  who welcomed rostov as a near relative and called him nicholas catherine petrovna did actually play valses and the ecossaise  and dancing began in which nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility  his particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all  nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening  he had never danced like that in moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form  but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual  something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces all the evening nicholas paid attention to a blue eyed  plump and pleasing little blonde  the wife of one of the provincial officials with the naive conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men s wives were created for them  rostov did not leave the lady s side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style  as if without speaking of it  they knew how capitally nicholas and the lady would get on together  the husband  however  did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with rostov  but the latter s good natured naivete was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to nicholas  good humor  toward the end of the evening  however  as the wife s face grew more flushed and animated  the husband s became more and more melancholy and solemn  as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife s share increased the husband s diminished chapter v nicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair  bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face  jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches  diffusing an odor of perfume  and admiring his partner  himself  and the fine outlines of his legs in their well fitting hessian boots  nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in voronezh which lady a charming lady  a divine one  her eyes  nicholas looked at his partner  are blue  her mouth coral and ivory  her figure  he glanced at her shoulders  like diana s the husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about ah  nikita ivanych  cried nicholas  rising politely  and as if wishing nikita ivanych to share his joke  he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady the husband smiled gloomily  the wife gaily  the governor s good natured wife came up with a look of disapproval anna ignatyevna wants to see you  nicholas  said she  pronouncing the name so that nicholas at once understood that anna ignatyevna was a very important person  come  nicholas  you know you let me call you so oh  yes  aunt  who is she anna ignatyevna malvintseva  she has heard from her niece how you rescued her  can you guess i rescued such a lot of them  said nicholas her niece  princess bolkonskaya  she is here in voronezh with her aunt oho  how you blush  why  are not a bit  please don t  aunt very well  very well  oh  what a fellow you are the governor s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress  who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town  this was malvintseva  princess mary s aunt on her mother s side  a rich  childless widow who always lived in voronezh  when rostov approached her she was standing settling up for the game  she looked at him and  screwing up her eyes sternly  continued to upbraid the general who had won from her very pleased  mon cher  she then said  holding out her hand to nicholas  pray come and see me after a few words about princess mary and her late father  whom malvintseva had evidently not liked  and having asked what nicholas knew of prince andrew  who also was evidently no favorite of hers  the important old lady dismissed nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her nicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed  at the mention of princess mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear which he himself did not understand when he had parted from malvintseva nicholas wished to return to the dancing  but the governor s little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and  saying that she wanted to have a talk with him  led him to her sitting room  from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way do you know  dear boy  began the governor s wife with a serious expression on her kind little face  that really would be the match for you  would you like me to arrange it whom do you mean  aunt  asked nicholas i will make a match for you with the princess  catherine petrovna speaks of lily  but i say  no the princess  do you want me to do it  i am sure your mother will be grateful to me  what a charming girl she is really  and she is not at all so plain  either not at all  replied nicholas as if offended at the idea  as befits a soldier  aunt  i don t force myself on anyone or refuse anything  he said before he had time to consider what he was saying well then  remember  this is not a joke of course not yes  yes  the governor s wife said as if talking to herself  but  my dear boy  among other things you are too attentive to the other  the blonde  one is sorry for the husband  really oh no  we are good friends with him  said nicholas in the simplicity of his heart  it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else but what nonsense i have been saying to the governor s wife  thought nicholas suddenly at supper  she will really begin to arrange a match  and sonya  and on taking leave of the governor s wife  when she again smilingly said to him  well then  remember  he drew her aside but see here  to tell the truth  aunt what is it  my dear  come  let s sit down here  said she nicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts which he would not have told to his mother  his sister  or his friend  to this woman who was almost a stranger  when he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him  it seemed to him as it seems to everyone in such cases that it was merely some silly whim that seized him  yet that burst of frankness  together with other trifling events had immense consequences for him and for all his family you see  aunt  mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress  but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me oh yes  i understand  said the governor s wife but princess bolkonskaya that s another matter  i will tell you the truth  in the first place i like her very much  i feel drawn to her  and then  after i met her under such circumstances so strangely  the idea often occurred to me  this is fate  especially if you remember that mamma had long been thinking of it  but i had never happened to meet her before  somehow it had always happened that we did not meet  and as long as my sister natasha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her  and it must needs happen that i should meet her just when natasha s engagement had been broken off  and then everything  so you see  i never told this to anyone and never will  only to you the governor s wife pressed his elbow gratefully you know sonya  my cousin  i love her  and promised to marry her  and will do so  so you see there can be no question about  said nicholas incoherently and blushing my dear boy  what a way to look at it  you know sonya has nothing and you yourself say your papa s affairs are in a very bad way  and what about your mother  it would kill her  that s one thing  and what sort of life would it be for sonya if she s a girl with a heart  your mother in despair  and you all ruined  no  my dear  you and sonya ought to understand that nicholas remained silent  it comforted him to hear these arguments all the same  aunt  it is impossible  he rejoined with a sigh  after a short pause  besides  would the princess have me  and besides  she is now in mourning  how can one think of it but you don t suppose i m going to get you married at once  there is always a right way of doing things  replied the governor s wife what a matchmaker you are  aunt  said nicholas  kissing her plump little hand chapter vi on reaching moscow after her meeting with rostov  princess mary had found her nephew there with his tutor  and a letter from prince andrew giving her instructions how to get to her aunt malvintseva at voronezh that feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father s illness  since his death  and especially since her meeting with rostov was smothered by arrangements for the journey  anxiety about her brother  settling in a new house  meeting new people  and attending to her nephew s education  she was sad  now  after a month passed in quiet surroundings  she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of russia  she was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother the only intimate person now remaining to her  was exposed  she was worried too about her nephew s education for which she had always felt herself incompetent  but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with rostov the day after her party the governor s wife came to see malvintseva and after discussing her plan with the aunt  remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was  of course  not to be thought of  all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another  malvintseva expressed approval  and the governor s wife began to speak of rostov in mary s presence  praising him and telling how he had blushed when princess mary s name was mentioned  but princess mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling her mental tranquillity was destroyed  and desires  doubts self reproach  and hopes reawoke during the two days that elapsed before rostov called  princess mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him  first she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt that it would not be proper for her  in her deep mourning  to receive visitors then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her  then it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor s wife had intentions concerning herself and rostov their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition then she told herself that only she  with her sinful nature  could think this of them  they could not forget that situated as she was  while still wearing deep mourning  such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her father s memory  assuming that she did go down to see him  princess mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him  and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much  more than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him but when on sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that count rostov had called  the princess showed no confusion only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light you have met him  aunt  said she in a calm voice  unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural when rostov entered the room  the princess dropped her eyes for an instant  as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt  and then just as nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes  with a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure  held out her slender  delicate hand to him and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated  mademoiselle bourienne  who was in the drawing room  looked at princess mary in bewildered surprise  herself a consummate coquette  she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract either black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it  and above all  what tact and grace  thought mademoiselle bourienne had princess mary been capable of reflection at that moment  she would have been more surprised than mademoiselle bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself  from the moment she recognized that dear loved face  a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will  from the time rostov entered  her face became suddenly transformed  it was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate  skillful  artistic work on its sides  that previously seemed dark  coarse  and meaningless was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty  for the first time all that pure  spiritual  inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface  all her inward labor  her dissatisfaction with herself  her sufferings  her strivings after goodness  her meekness  love  and self sacrifice all this now shone in those radiant eyes  in her delicate smile  and in every trait of her gentle face rostov saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life  he felt that the being before him was quite different from  and better than  anyone he had met before  and above all better than himself their conversation was very simple and unimportant  they spoke of the war  and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it  they spoke of their last meeting nicholas trying to change the subject they talked of the governor s kind wife  of nicholas relations  and of princess mary s she did not talk about her brother  diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned andrew  evidently she could speak of russia s misfortunes with a certain artificiality  but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him  nicholas noticed this  as he noticed every shade of princess mary s character with an observation unusual to him  and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess as she did when he was mentioned  and even when he thought of her  but in her presence he felt quite at ease  and said not at all what he had prepared  but what  quite appropriately  occurred to him at the moment when a pause occurred during his short visit  nicholas  as is usual when there are children  turned to prince andrew s little son  caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar  he took the boy on his knee  played with him  and looked round at princess mary  with a softened  happy  timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved  nicholas also noticed that look and  as if understanding it  flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness as she was in mourning princess mary did not go out into society  and nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again  but all the same the governor s wife went on with her matchmaking  passing on to nicholas the flattering things princess mary said of him and vice versa and insisting on his declaring himself to princess mary  for this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop s house before mass though rostov told the governor s wife that he would not make any declaration to princess mary  he promised to go as at tilsit rostov had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right  so now  after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice  and in obedient submission to circumstances  he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where  he knew that after his promise to sonya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to princess mary  and he knew that he would never act basely  but he also knew or rather felt at the bottom of his heart that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him  he was not only doing nothing wrong  but was doing something very important more important than anything he had ever done in his life after meeting princess mary  though the course of his life went on externally as before  all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her  but he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society  nor as he had for a long time  and at one time rapturously thought about sonya  he had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honest hearted young men do  that is  as a possible wife adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life  a white dressing gown  his wife at the tea table  his wife s carriage little ones  mamma and papa  their relations to her  and so on and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure  but with princess mary  to whom they were trying to get him engaged  he could never picture anything of future married life  if he tried  his pictures seemed incongruous and false  it made him afraid chapter vii the dreadful news of the battle of borodino  of our losses in killed and wounded  and the still more terrible news of the loss of moscow reached voronezh in the middle of september  princess mary  having learned of her brother s wound only from the gazette and having no definite news of him  prepared so nicholas heard  he had not seen her again himself  to set off in search of prince andrew when he received the news of the battle of borodino and the abandonment of moscow  rostov was not seized with despair  anger  the desire for vengeance  or any feeling of that kind  but everything in voronezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome  and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness  the conversations he heard seemed to him insincere  he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him  he made haste to finish buying the horses  and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster a few days before his departure a special thanksgiving  at which nicholas was present  was held in the cathedral for the russian victory he stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service  meditating on a great variety of subjects when the service was over the governor s wife beckoned him to her have you seen the princess  she asked  indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side  beyond the choir nicholas immediately recognized princess mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude  timidity  and pity that immediately overcame him  princess mary  evidently engrossed by her thoughts  was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church nicholas looked at her face with surprise  it was the same face he had seen before  there was the same general expression of refined  inner spiritual labor  but now it was quite differently lit up  there was a pathetic expression of sorrow  prayer  and hope in it  as had occurred before when she was present  nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor s wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church  and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul  as soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face  lighting up both her sorrow and her joy there is one thing i wanted to tell you  princess  said rostov  it is that if your brother  prince andrew nikolievich  were not living  it would have been at once announced in the gazette  as he is a colonel the princess looked at him  not grasping what he was saying  but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face and i have known so many cases of a splinter wound  the gazette said it was a shell  either proving fatal at once or being very slight continued nicholas  we must hope for the best  and i am sure princess mary interrupted him oh  that would be so dread  she began and  prevented by agitation from finishing  she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and  looking up at him gratefully went out  following her aunt that evening nicholas did not go out  but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers  when he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed and for a long time he paced up and down the room  reflecting on his life  a thing he rarely did princess mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in smolensk province  his having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances  and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match  had drawn his particular attention to her  when he met her again in voronezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful  nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time  he was  however  preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her  but that day s encounter in church had  he felt  sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind  that pale sad  refined face  that radiant look  those gentle graceful gestures and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy  in men rostov could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life that was why he did not like prince andrew  and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess  but in princess mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction she must be a wonderful woman  a real angel  he said to himself  why am i not free  why was i in such a hurry with sonya  and he involuntarily compared the two  the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly  he tried to picture what would happen were he free  how he would propose to her and how she would become his wife but no  he could not imagine that  he felt awed  and no clear picture presented itself to his mind  he had long ago pictured to himself a future with sonya  and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in sonya  but it was impossible to picture a future with princess mary  because he did not understand her but simply loved her reveries about sonya had had something merry and playful in them  but to dream of princess mary was always difficult and a little frightening how she prayed  he thought  it was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer  yes  that was the prayer that moves mountains  and i am sure her prayer will be answered  why don t i pray for what i want  he suddenly thought  what do i want  to be free  released from sonya she was right  he thought  remembering what the governor s wife had said  nothing but misfortune can come of marrying sonya  muddles  grief for mamma  business difficulties  muddles  terrible muddles besides  i don t love her not as i should  o  god  release me from this dreadful  inextricable position  he suddenly began to pray  yes prayer can move mountains  but one must have faith and not pray as natasha and i used to as children  that the snow might turn into sugar and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so  no  but i am not praying for trifles now  he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner  and folding his hands placed himself before the icon  softened by memories of princess mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time  tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and lavrushka came in with some papers blockhead  why do you come in without being called  cried nicholas quickly changing his attitude from the governor  said lavrushka in a sleepy voice  a courier has arrived and there s a letter for you well  all right  thanks  you can go nicholas took the two letters  one of which was from his mother and the other from sonya  he recognized them by the handwriting and opened sonya s first  he had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy no  it s not possible  he cried aloud unable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it  he glanced through it  then read it again  and then again and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders stretching out his hands  with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed what he had just been praying for with confidence that god would hear him had come to pass  but nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected  and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from god to whom he had prayed  but by some ordinary coincidence this unexpected and  as it seemed to nicholas  quite voluntary letter from sonya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape  she wrote that the last unfortunate events the loss of almost the whole of the rostovs  moscow property and the countess  repeatedly expressed wish that nicholas should marry princess bolkonskaya  together with his silence and coldness of late  had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free it would be too painful to me to think that i might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me she wrote  and my love has no aim but the happiness of those i love  so  nicholas  i beg you to consider yourself free  and to be assured that  in spite of everything  no one can love you more than does your sonya both letters were written from troitsa  the other  from the countess described their last days in moscow  their departure  the fire  and the destruction of all their property  in this letter the countess also mentioned that prince andrew was among the wounded traveling with them his state was very critical  but the doctor said there was now more hope  sonya and natasha were nursing him next day nicholas took his mother s letter and went to see princess mary  neither he nor she said a word about what natasha nursing him might mean  but thanks to this letter nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations the following day he saw princess mary off on her journey to yaroslavl and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment chapter viii sonya s letter written from troitsa  which had come as an answer to nicholas  prayer  was prompted by this  the thought of getting nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess  mind more and more  she knew that sonya was the chief obstacle to this happening  and sonya s life in the countess  house had grown harder and harder  especially after they had received a letter from nicholas telling of his meeting with princess mary in bogucharovo  the countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to sonya but a few days before they left moscow  moved and excited by all that was going on  she called sonya to her and  instead of reproaching and making demands on her  tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with nicholas i shall not be at peace till you promise me this sonya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything  but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her  she must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up  to sacrifice herself for others was sonya s habit  her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth  and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it  but in all her former acts of self sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others  and so made her more worthy of nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world  but now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life and for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully  she felt jealous of natasha who had never experienced anything of this sort  had never needed to sacrifice herself  but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody  and for the first time sonya felt that out of her pure  quiet love for nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle  virtue  or religion  under the influence of this feeling sonya  whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive  having answered the countess in vague general terms  avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see nicholas  not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever the bustle and terror of the rostovs  last days in moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed sonya  she was glad to find escape from them in practical activity  but when she heard of prince andrew s presence in their house  despite her sincere pity for him and for natasha  she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that god did not intend her to be separated from nicholas  she knew that natasha loved no one but prince andrew and had never ceased to love him  she knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another  and that nicholas would then not be able to marry princess mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity  despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey  this feeling that providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered sonya at the troitsa monastery the rostovs first broke their journey for a whole day three large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry  one of which was occupied by prince andrew  the wounded man was much better that day and natasha was sitting with him  in the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior  who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery sonya was there too  tormented by curiosity as to what prince andrew and natasha were talking about  she heard the sound of their voices through the door  that door opened and natasha came out  looking excited  not noticing the monk  who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm  she went up to sonya and took her hand natasha  what are you about  come here  said the countess natasha went up to the monk for his blessing  and he advised her to pray for aid to god and his saint as soon as the prior withdrew  natasha took her friend by the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room sonya  will he live  she asked  sonya  how happy i am  and how unhappy  sonya  dovey  everything is as it used to be  if only he lives  he cannot  because  because  of  and natasha burst into tears yes  i knew it  thank god  murmured sonya  he will live sonya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter s fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one sobbing  she kissed and comforted natasha  if only he lives  she thought  having wept  talked  and wiped away their tears  the two friends went together to prince andrew s door  natasha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room  sonya standing beside her at the half open door prince andrew was lying raised high on three pillows  his pale face was calm  his eyes closed  and they could see his regular breathing o  natasha  sonya suddenly almost screamed  catching her companion s arm and stepping back from the door what  what is it  asked natasha it s that  that  said sonya  with a white face and trembling lips natasha softly closed the door and went with sonya to the window  not yet understanding what the latter was telling her you remember  said sonya with a solemn and frightened expression  you remember when i looked in the mirror for you  at otradnoe at christmas  do you remember what i saw yes  yes  cried natasha opening her eyes wide  and vaguely recalling that sonya had told her something about prince andrew whom she had seen lying down you remember  sonya went on  i saw it then and told everybody  you and dunyasha  i saw him lying on a bed  said she  making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail  and that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt  and that his hands were folded  she concluded  convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror she had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head  but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection  she not only remembered what she had then said that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed yes  yes  it really was pink  cried natasha  who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used  and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction but what does it mean  she added meditatively oh  i don t know  it is all so strange  replied sonya  clutching at her head a few minutes later prince andrew rang and natasha went to him  but sonya  feeling unusually excited and touched  remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred they had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army  and the countess was writing to her son sonya  said the countess  raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed  sonya  won t you write to nicholas  she spoke in a soft tremulous voice  and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles sonya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words  those eyes expressed entreaty  shame at having to ask  fear of a refusal  and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal sonya went up to the countess and  kneeling down  kissed her hand yes  mamma  i will write  said she sonya was softened  excited  and touched by all that had occurred that day  especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision  now that she knew that the renewal of natasha s relations with prince andrew would prevent nicholas from marrying princess mary  she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live  so with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed nicholas chapter ix the officer and soldiers who had arrested pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect  in the guardhouse to which he was taken in their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be perhaps a very important person and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him but when the guard was relieved next morning  pierre felt that for the new guard both officers and men he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors  and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big  stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child  they saw in him only no   of the captured russians  arrested and detained for some reason by order of the higher command  if they noticed anything remarkable about pierre  it was only his unabashed  meditative concentration and thoughtfulness  and the way he spoke french  which struck them as surprisingly good  in spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects  as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer all the russians confined with pierre were men of the lowest class and recognizing him as a gentleman  they all avoided him  more especially as he spoke french  pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him that evening he learned that all these prisoners he  probably  among them  were to be tried for incendiarism  on the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a french general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other frenchmen with scarves on their arms with the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners and which is supposed to preclude human frailty  pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was  where he had been  with what object and so on these questions  like questions put at trials generally  left the essence of the matter aside  shut out the possibility of that essence s being revealed  and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result  namely a conviction  as soon as pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim  the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste  pierre felt  moreover  what the accused always feel at their trial  perplexity as to why these questions were put to him  he had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed  he knew he was in these men s power  that only by force had they brought him there  that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions  and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him  and so  as they had the power and wish to inculpate him this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary  it was evident that any answer would lead to conviction  when asked what he was doing when he was arrested  pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames  why had he fought the marauder  pierre answered that he was protecting a woman  and that to protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man  that  they interrupted him  for this was not to the point  why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him  he replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in moscow  again they interrupted him  they had not asked where he was going  but why he was found near the fire  who was he  they asked  repeating their first question  which he had declined to answer again he replied that he could not answer it put that down  that s bad  very bad  sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face on the fourth day fires broke out on the zubovski rampart pierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant s house near the crimean bridge  on his way through the streets pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city fires were visible on all sides  he did not then realize the significance of the burning of moscow  and looked at the fires with horror he passed four days in the coach house near the crimean bridge and during that time learned  from the talk of the french soldiers  that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal  what marshal this was  pierre could not learn from the soldiers  evidently for them the marshal  represented a very high and rather mysterious power these first days  before the eighth of september when the prisoners were had up for a second examination  were the hardest of all for pierre chapter x on the eighth of september an officer a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him entered the coach house where the prisoners were  this officer  probably someone on the staff  was holding a paper in his hand  and called over all the russians there  naming pierre as the man who does not give his name  glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners  he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal  an hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and pierre with thirteen others was led to the virgin s field  it was a fine day  sunny after rain  and the air was unusually pure  the smoke did not hang low as on the day when pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the zubovski rampart  but rose through the pure air in columns  no flames were seen  but columns of smoke rose on all sides  and all moscow as far as pierre could see was one vast charred ruin  on all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing  and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses  pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well  here and there he could see churches that had not been burned  the kremlin  which was not destroyed  gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of ivan the great  the domes of the new convent of the virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly these bells reminded pierre that it was sunday and the feast of the nativity of the virgin  but there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday  everywhere were blackened ruins  and the few russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the french it was plain that the russian nest was ruined and destroyed  but in place of the russian order of life that had been destroyed  pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different  firm  french order had been established over this ruined nest  he felt this in the looks of the soldiers who  marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily  were escorting him and the other criminals  he felt it in the looks of an important french official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier whom they met on the way  he felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field  and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the french officer had read out when he came that morning  pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men and it seemed that they might have forgotten him  or confused him with the others  but no  the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as the man who does not give his name and under that appellation  which to pierre seemed terrible  they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place  pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well he and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the virgin s field  to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent  this was prince shcherbitov s house  where pierre had often been in other days  and which  as he learned from the talk of the soldiers  was now occupied by the marshal  the duke of eckmuhl davout they were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one pierre was the sixth to enter  he was conducted through a glass gallery an anteroom  and a hall  which were familiar to him  into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant davout  spectacles on nose  sat bent over a table at the further end of the room  pierre went close up to him  but davout  evidently consulting a paper that lay before him  did not look up  without raising his eyes he said in a low voice who are you pierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word  to him davout was not merely a french general  but a man notorious for his cruelty  looking at his cold face  as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer  pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life  but he did not know what to say  he did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination  yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing  so he was silent  but before he had decided what to do davout raised his head  pushed his spectacles back on his forehead screwed up his eyes  and looked intently at him i know that man  he said in a cold  measured tone  evidently calculated to frighten pierre the chill that had been running down pierre s back now seized his head as in a vise you cannot know me  general  i have never seen you he is a russian spy  davout interrupted  addressing another general who was present  but whom pierre had not noticed davout turned away  with an unexpected reverberation in his voice pierre rapidly began no  monseigneur  he said  suddenly remembering that davout was a duke no  monseigneur  you cannot have known me  i am a militia officer and have not quitted moscow your name  asked davout bezukhov what proof have i that you are not lying monseigneur  exclaimed pierre  not in an offended but in a pleading voice davout looked up and gazed intently at him  for some seconds they looked at one another  and that look saved pierre  apart from conditions of war and law  that look established human relations between the two men  at that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds  and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers at the first glance  when davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers  pierre was merely a circumstance  and davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed  but now he saw in him a human being  he reflected for a moment how can you show me that you are telling the truth  said davout coldly pierre remembered ramballe  and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was you are not what you say  returned davout in a trembling  faltering voice pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements but at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to davout davout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought  and began buttoning up his uniform  it seemed that he had quite forgotten pierre when the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner  he jerked his head in pierre s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away  but where they were to take him pierre did not know  back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the virgin s field he turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to davout yes  of course  replied davout  but what this yes  meant  pierre did not know pierre could not afterwards remember how he went  whether it was far  or in which direction  his faculties were quite numbed  he was stupefied and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too  the only thought in his mind at that time was  who was it that had really sentenced him to death  not the men on the commission that had first examined him not one of them wished to or  evidently  could have done it  it was not davout  who had looked at him in so human a way  in another moment davout would have realized that he was doing wrong  but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him  the adjutant  also  had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in  then who was executing him  killing him  depriving him of life him pierre  with all his memories  aspirations  hopes  and thoughts  who was doing this  and pierre felt that it was no one it was a system a concurrence of circumstances a system of some sort was killing him pierre depriving him of life  of everything  annihilating him chapter xi from prince shcherbatov s house the prisoners were led straight down the virgin s field  to the left of the nunnery  as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up  beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground  and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle  the crowd consisted of a few russians and many of napoleon s soldiers who were not on duty germans  italians  and frenchmen  in a variety of uniforms  to the right and left of the post stood rows of french troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos the prisoners were placed in a certain order  according to the list pierre was sixth  and were led to the post  several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them  and at that sound pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away  he lost the power of thinking or understanding  he could only hear and see  and he had only one wish that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them the two first were convicts with shaven heads  one was tall and thin the other dark  shaggy  and sinewy  with a flat nose  the third was a domestic serf  about forty five years old  with grizzled hair and a plump  well nourished body  the fourth was a peasant  a very handsome man with a broad  light brown beard and black eyes  the fifth was a factory hand  a thin  sallow faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat pierre heard the french consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time  in couples  replied the officer in command in a calm voice  there was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying not as men hurry to do something they understand  but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task a french official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in russian and in french then two pairs of frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officer s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row  the convicts stopped when they reached the post and  while sacks were being brought  looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman  one crossed himself continually  the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile  with hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them  drawing the sacks over their heads  and bound them to the post twelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post  pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen  suddenly a crackling  rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder  and he looked round  there was some smoke  and the frenchmen were doing something near the pit  with pale faces and trembling hands two more prisoners were led up  in the same way and with similar looks these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes  evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them  they could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them  and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them again pierre did not wish to look and again turned away  but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear  and at the same moment he saw smoke  blood  and the pale  scared faces of the frenchmen who were again doing something by the post  their trembling hands impeding one another  pierre  breathing heavily  looked around as if asking what it meant  the same question was expressed in all the looks that met his on the faces of all the russians and of the french soldiers and officers without exception  he read the same dismay  horror  and conflict that were in his own heart  but who  after all  is doing this  they are all suffering as i am  who then is it  who  flashed for an instant through his mind sharpshooters of the th  forward  shouted someone  the fifth prisoner  the one next to pierre  was led away alone  pierre did not understand that he was saved  that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution  with ever growing horror  and no sense of joy or relief  he gazed at what was taking place  the fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak  the moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at pierre  pierre shuddered and shook himself free  the lad was unable to walk  they dragged him along  holding him up under the arms  and he screamed  when they got him to the post he grew quiet  as if he suddenly understood something whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him  at any rate he took his stand at the post  waiting to be blindfolded like the others  and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes pierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes  his curiosity and agitation  like that of the whole crowd  reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder  like the others this fifth man seemed calm  he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other when they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head  then when they propped him against the bloodstained post  he leaned back and  not being comfortable in that position  straightened himself  adjusted his feet  and leaned back again more comfortably  pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement probably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets  but try as he would pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots  he only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him  how blood showed itself in two places  how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body  and how the workman sat down  his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him  pierre ran up to the post  no one hindered him  pale  frightened people were doing something around the workman the lower jaw of an old frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes  the body collapsed  the soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit they all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible pierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other that shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively  but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body  one of the soldiers  evidently suffering  shouted gruffly and angrily at pierre to go back  but pierre did not understand him and remained near the post and no one drove him away when the pit had been filled up a command was given  pierre was taken back to his place  and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace  the twenty four sharpshooters with discharged muskets  standing in the center of the circle  ran back to their places as the companies passed by pierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle  all but one rejoined their companies  this one  a young soldier  his face deadly pale  his shako pushed back  and his musket resting on the ground  still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired  he swayed like a drunken man  taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling  an old  noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company  the crowd of russians and frenchmen began to disperse  they all went away silently and with drooping heads that will teach them to start fires  said one of the frenchmen pierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done  but was not able to do so  without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away chapter xii after the execution pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small  ruined  and befouled church toward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war  without understanding what was said to him  pierre got up and went with the soldiers  they took him to the upper end of the field  where there were some sheds built of charred planks  beams  and battens  and led him into one of them  in the darkness some twenty different men surrounded pierre  he looked at them without understanding who they were  why they were there  or what they wanted of him  he heard what they said  but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them  he replied to questions they put to him  but did not consider who was listening to his replies  nor how they would understand them  he looked at their faces and figures  but they all seemed to him equally meaningless from the moment pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them  it was as if the mainspring of his life  on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive  had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish  though he did not acknowledge it to himself  his faith in the right ordering of the universe  in humanity in his own soul  and in god  had been destroyed  he had experienced this before  but never so strongly as now  when similar doubts had assailed him before  they had been the result of his own wrongdoing  and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself  but now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained  and this not by any fault of his own  he felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life around him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly  they were telling him something and asking him something  then they led him away somewhere  and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides well  then  mates  that very prince who  some voice at the other end of the shed was saying  with a strong emphasis on the word who sitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes  but as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad especially dreadful because of its simplicity and the faces of the murderers  even more dreadful because of their disquiet  and he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him beside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved  this man was doing something to his legs in the darkness  and though pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him  on growing used to the darkness pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands  and the way he did it aroused pierre s interest having unwound the string that tied the band on one leg  he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg  glancing up at pierre  while one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg  in this way  having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly  the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head  then he took out a knife  cut something  closed the knife  placed it under the head of his bed  and  seating himself comfortably  clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on pierre  the latter was conscious of something pleasant  comforting and well rounded in these deft movements  in the man s well ordered arrangements in his corner  and even in his very smell  and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him you ve seen a lot of trouble  sir  eh  the little man suddenly said and there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that pierre tried to reply  but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes  the little fellow  giving pierre no time to betray his confusion  instantly continued in the same pleasant tones eh  lad  don t fret  said he  in the tender singsong caressing voice old russian peasant women employ  don t fret  friend suffer an hour live for an age  that s how it is  my dear fellow  and here we live thank heaven  without offense  among these folk  too  there are good men as well as bad  said he  and still speaking  he turned on his knees with a supple movement  got up  coughed  and went off to another part of the shed eh  you rascal  pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed  so you ve come  you rascal  she remembers  now  now that ll do and the soldier  pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him returned to his place and sat down  in his hands he had something wrapped in a rag here  eat a bit  sir  said he  resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered pierre some baked potatoes  we had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand pierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him  he thanked the soldier and began to eat well  are they all right  said the soldier with a smile  you should do like this he took a potato  drew out his clasp knife  cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand  sprinkled some salt on it from the rag  and handed it to pierre the potatoes are grand  he said once more  eat some like that pierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better oh  i m all right  said he  but why did they shoot those poor fellows  the last one was hardly twenty tss  tt  said the little man  ah  what a sin  what a sin  he added quickly  and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on  how was it  sir  that you stayed in moscow i didn t think they would come so soon  i stayed accidentally  replied pierre and how did they arrest you  dear lad  at your house no  i went to look at the fire  and they arrested me there  and tried me as an incendiary where there s law there s injustice  put in the little man and have you been here long  pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato i  it was last sunday they took me  out of a hospital in moscow why  are you a soldier then yes  we are soldiers of the apsheron regiment  i was dying of fever  we weren t told anything  there were some twenty of us lying there  we had no idea  never guessed at all and do you feel sad here  pierre inquired how can one help it  lad  my name is platon  and the surname is karataev  he added  evidently wishing to make it easier for pierre to address him  they call me little falcon  in the regiment  how is one to help feeling sad  moscow she s the mother of cities  how can one see all this and not feel sad  but the maggot gnaws the cabbage  yet dies first  that s what the old folks used to tell us  he added rapidly what  what did you say  asked pierre who  i  said karataev  i say things happen not as we plan but as god judges  he replied  thinking that he was repeating what he had said before  and immediately continued well  and you  have you a family estate  sir  and a house  so you have abundance  then  and a housewife  and your old parents  are they still living  he asked and though it was too dark for pierre to see  he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier s lips as he put these questions  he seemed grieved that pierre had no parents  especially that he had no mother a wife for counsel  a mother in law for welcome  but there s none as dear as one s own mother  said he  well  and have you little ones  he went on asking again pierre s negative answer seemed to distress him  and he hastened to add never mind  you re young folks yet  and please god may still have some the great thing is to live in harmony but it s all the same now  pierre could not help saying ah  my dear fellow  rejoined karataev  never decline a prison or a beggar s sack he seated himself more comfortably and coughed  evidently preparing to tell a long story well  my dear fellow  i was still living at home  he began  we had a well to do homestead  plenty of land  we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank god for  when father and we went out mowing there were seven of us  we lived well  we were real peasants  it so happened and platon karataev told a long story of how he had gone into someone s copse to take wood  how he had been caught by the keeper  had been tried  flogged  and sent to serve as a soldier well  lad  and a smile changed the tone of his voice we thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing  if it had not been for my sin  my brother would have had to go as a soldier  but he  my younger brother  had five little ones  while i  you see  only left a wife behind  we had a little girl  but god took her before i went as a soldier  i come home on leave and i ll tell you how it was  i look and see that they are living better than before  the yard full of cattle the women at home  two brothers away earning wages  and only michael the youngest  at home  father  he says  all my children are the same to me it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten  but if platon hadn t been shaved for a soldier  michael would have had to go  called us all to him and  will you believe it  placed us in front of the icons michael  he says  come here and bow down to his feet  and you  young woman  you bow down too  and you  grandchildren  also bow down before him  do you understand  he says  that s how it is  dear fellow  fate looks for a head  but we are always judging  that s not well that s not right  our luck is like water in a dragnet  you pull at it and it bulges  but when you ve drawn it out it s empty  that s how it is and platon shifted his seat on the straw after a short silence he rose well  i think you must be sleepy  said he  and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating lord jesus christ  holy saint nicholas  frola and lavra  lord jesus christ  holy saint nicholas  frola and lavra  lord jesus christ  have mercy on us and save us  he concluded  then bowed to the ground  got up  sighed  and sat down again on his heap of straw  that s the way lay me down like a stone  o god  and raise me up like a loaf  he muttered as he lay down  pulling his coat over him what prayer was that you were saying  asked pierre eh  murmured platon  who had almost fallen asleep  what was i saying i was praying  don t you pray yes  i do  said pierre  but what was that you said  frola and lavra well  of course  replied platon quickly  the horses  saints  one must pity the animals too  eh  the rascal  now you ve curled up and got warm you daughter of a bitch  said karataev  touching the dog that lay at his feet  and again turning over he fell asleep immediately sounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside  and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed  but inside it was quiet and dark  for a long time pierre did not sleep  but lay with eyes open in the darkness  listening to the regular snoring of platon who lay beside him  and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations chapter xiii twenty three soldiers  three officers  and two officials were confined in the shed in which pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks when pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except platon karataev  who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything russian kindly  and round  when pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him  as of something round  was fully confirmed platon s whole figure in a french overcoat girdled with a cord  a soldier s cap  and bast shoes was round  his head was quite round  his back  chest  shoulders  and even his arms  which he held as if ever ready to embrace something  were rounded  his pleasant smile and his large  gentle brown eyes were also round platon karataev must have been fifty  judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in  told as by an old soldier  he did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it  but his brilliantly white  strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed as he often did were all sound and good  there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head  and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance his face  despite its fine  rounded wrinkles  had an expression of innocence and youth  his voice was pleasant and musical  but the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness  it was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness his physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant  every night before lying down  he said  lord  lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf  and every morning on getting up  he said  i lay down and curled up  i get up and shake myself  and indeed he only had to lie down  to fall asleep like a stone  and he only had to shake himself  to be ready without a moment s delay for some work  just as children are ready to play directly they awake  he could do everything  not very well but not badly  he baked  cooked  sewed planed  and mended boots  he was always busy  and only at night allowed himself conversation of which he was fond and songs  he did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to  but like the birds evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness  and the sounds were always high pitched  mournful  delicate  and almost feminine  and his face at such times was very serious having been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow  he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him everything military and alien to himself and had returned to his former peasant habits a soldier on leave a shirt outside breeches  he would say he did not like talking about his life as a soldier  though he did not complain  and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service  when he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his christian  life  as he called his peasant existence  the proverbs  of which his talk was full were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant  but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom he would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion  yet both would be right  he liked to talk and he talked well adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which pierre thought he invented himself  but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events sometimes just such as pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them assumed in karataev s a character of solemn fitness  he liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening they were always the same  but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life  he would smile joyfully when listening to such stories  now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself  karataev had no attachments  friendships  or love  as pierre understood them  but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with  particularly with man not any particular man  but those with whom he happened to be  he loved his dog  his comrades  the french  and pierre who was his neighbor  but pierre felt that in spite of karataev s affectionate tenderness for him by which he unconsciously gave pierre s spiritual life its due  he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him  and pierre began to feel in the same way toward karataev to all the other prisoners platon karataev seemed a most ordinary soldier  they called him little falcon  or platosha  chaffed him good naturedly  and sent him on errands  but to pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night  an unfathomable  rounded eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth platon karataev knew nothing by heart except his prayers  when he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude sometimes pierre  struck by the meaning of his words  would ask him to repeat them  but platon could never recall what he had said a moment before  just as he never could repeat to pierre the words of his favorite song  native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it  but when spoken and not sung  no meaning could be got out of it  he did not  and could not  understand the meaning of words apart from their context  every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him  which was his life  but his life  as he regarded it  had no meaning as a separate thing  it had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious  his words and actions flowed from him as evenly  inevitably  and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower  he could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately chapter xiv when princess mary heard from nicholas that her brother was with the rostovs at yaroslavl she at once prepared to go there  in spite of her aunt s efforts to dissuade her and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her  whether it were difficult or easy  possible or impossible  she did not ask and did not want to know  it was her duty not only to herself  to be near her brother who was perhaps dying  but to do everything possible to take his son to him  and so she prepared to set off  that she had not heard from prince andrew himself  princess mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son in a few days princess mary was ready to start  her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to voronezh  a semiopen trap  and a baggage cart  with her traveled mademoiselle bourienne little nicholas and his tutor  her old nurse  three maids  tikhon  and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her the usual route through moscow could not be thought of  and the roundabout way princess mary was obliged to take through lipetsk ryazan  vladimir  and shuya was very long and  as post horses were not everywhere obtainable  very difficult  and near ryazan where the french were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous during this difficult journey mademoiselle bourienne  dessalles  and princess mary s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit  she went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them  and no difficulties daunted her  thanks to her activity and energy  which infected her fellow travelers  they approached yaroslavl by the end of the second week the last days of her stay in voronezh had been the happiest of her life her love for rostov no longer tormented or agitated her  it filled her whole soul  had become an integral part of herself  and she no longer struggled against it  latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved  though she never said this definitely to herself in words  she had become convinced of it at her last interview with nicholas  when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the rostovs  not by a single word had nicholas alluded to the fact that prince andrew s relations with natasha might  if he recovered  be renewed  but princess mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this yet in spite of that  his relation to her considerate  delicate  and loving not only remained unchanged  but it sometimes seemed to princess mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely  she knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved  and was happy in regard to it but this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force  on the contrary  that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother  that feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving voronezh that those who saw her off  as they looked at her careworn  despairing face  felt sure she would fall ill on the journey  but the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey  which she took so actively in hand  saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength as always happens when traveling  princess mary thought only of the journey itself  forgetting its object  but as she approached yaroslavl the thought of what might await her there not after many days  but that very evening again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit the courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the rostovs were staying in yaroslavl  and in what condition prince andrew was  when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess  face that looked out at him from the window i have found out everything  your excellency  the rostovs are staying at the merchant bronnikov s house  in the square not far from here right above the volga  said the courier princess mary looked at him with frightened inquiry  not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know  how was her brother  mademoiselle bourienne put that question for her how is the prince  she asked his excellency is staying in the same house with them then he is alive  thought princess mary  and asked in a low voice how is he the servants say he is still the same what still the same  might mean princess mary did not ask  but with an unnoticed glance at little seven year old nicholas  who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town  she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach  rumbling  shaking and swaying  came to a stop  the carriage steps clattered as they were let down the carriage door was opened  on the left there was water a great river and on the right a porch  there were people at the entrance servants  and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair  smiling as it seemed to princess mary in an unpleasantly affected way  this was sonya  princess mary ran up the steps  this way  this way  said the girl  with the same artificial smile  and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of oriental type  who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion  this was the countess  she embraced princess mary and kissed her mon enfant  she muttered  je vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps   my child  i love you and have known you a long time despite her excitement  princess mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her  hardly knowing how she did it  she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in french in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her  and asked  how is he the doctor says that he is not in danger  said the countess  but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh  and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words where is he  can i see him can i  asked the princess one moment  princess  one moment  my dear  is this his son  said the countess  turning to little nicholas who was coming in with dessalles there will be room for everybody  this is a big house  oh  what a lovely boy the countess took princess mary into the drawing room  where sonya was talking to mademoiselle bourienne  the countess caressed the boy  and the old count came in and welcomed the princess  he had changed very much since princess mary had last seen him  then he had been a brisk cheerful  self assured old man  now he seemed a pitiful  bewildered person  while talking to princess mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing  after the destruction of moscow and of his property  thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life in spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible  and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting  for a time  to this new order of things which she had entered  she knew it to be necessary  and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people this is my niece  said the count  introducing sonya you don t know her  princess princess mary turned to sonya and  trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl  she kissed her  but she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart where is he  she asked again  addressing them all he is downstairs  natasha is with him  answered sonya  flushing  we have sent to ask  i think you must be tired  princess tears of vexation showed themselves in princess mary s eyes  she turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him  when light  impetuous  and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door the princess looked round and saw natasha coming in  almost running that natasha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in moscow long since but hardly had the princess looked at natasha s face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief  and consequently a friend she ran to meet her  embraced her  and began to cry on her shoulder as soon as natasha  sitting at the head of prince andrew s bed  heard of princess mary s arrival  she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to princess mary there was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room that of love boundless love for him  for her  and for all that was near to the man she loved  and of pity  suffering for others and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them  it was plain that at that moment there was in natasha s heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with prince andrew princess mary  with her acute sensibility  understood all this at the first glance at natasha s face  and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure come  come to him  mary  said natasha  leading her into the other room princess mary raised her head  dried her eyes  and turned to natasha she felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything how  she began her question but stopped short she felt that it was impossible to ask  or to answer  in words natasha s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly natasha was gazing at her  but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not  she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart  it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw  and suddenly  natasha s lips twitched  ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth  and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs princess mary understood but she still hoped  and asked  in words she herself did not trust but how is his wound  what is his general condition you  you  will see  was all natasha could say they sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces how has his whole illness gone  is it long since he grew worse  when did this happen  princess mary inquired natasha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered  but at troitsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene  that danger had also passed  when they reached yaroslavl the wound had begun to fester natasha knew all about such things as festering  and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course  then fever set in but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious but two days ago this suddenly happened  said natasha  struggling with her sobs  i don t know why  but you will see what he is like is he weaker  thinner  asked the princess no  it s not that  but worse  you will see  o  mary  he is too good  he cannot  cannot live  because chapter xv when natasha opened prince andrew s door with a familiar movement and let princess mary pass into the room before her  the princess felt the sobs in her throat  hard as she had tried to prepare herself  and now tried to remain tranquil  she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears the princess understood what natasha had meant by the words  two days ago this suddenly happened  she understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death  as she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination andrew s face as she remembered it in childhood  a gentle mild  sympathetic face which he had rarely shown  and which therefore affected her very strongly  she was sure he would speak soft  tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death  and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence  yet sooner or later it had to be  and she went in  the sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features  and then she saw his face and met his gaze he was lying in a squirrel fur dressing gown on a divan  surrounded by pillows  he was thin and pale  in one thin  translucently white hand he held a handkerchief  while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown  moving his fingers slowly  his eyes gazed at them as they entered on seeing his face and meeting his eyes princess mary s pace suddenly slackened  she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased  she suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes but in what am i to blame  she asked herself  and his cold  stern look replied  because you are alive and thinking of the living  while i in the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and natasha he kissed his sister  holding her hand in his as was their wont how are you  mary  how did you manage to get here  said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look had he screamed in agony  that scream would not have struck such horror into princess mary s heart as the tone of his voice and have you brought little nicholas  he asked in the same slow  quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember how are you now  said princess mary  herself surprised at what she was saying that  my dear  you must ask the doctor  he replied  and again making an evident effort to be affectionate  he said with his lips only his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts merci  chere amie  d etre venue   thank you for coming  my dear princess mary pressed his hand  the pressure made him wince just perceptibly  he was silent  and she did not know what to say  she now understood what had happened to him two days before  in his words  his tone  and especially in that calm  almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world  terrible in one who is alive  evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living  but it was obvious that he failed to understand  not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else something the living did not and could not understand and which wholly occupied his mind there  you see how strangely fate has brought us together  said he breaking the silence and pointing to natasha  she looks after me all the time princess mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing  he  the sensitive  tender prince andrew  how could he say that before her whom he loved and who loved him  had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone  if he had not known that he was dying  how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence  the only explanation was that he was indifferent  because something else  much more important had been revealed to him the conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off mary came by way of ryazan  said natasha prince andrew did not notice that she called his sister mary  and only after calling her so in his presence did natasha notice it herself really  he asked they told her that all moscow has been burned down  and that natasha stopped  it was impossible to talk  it was plain that he was making an effort to listen  but could not do so yes  they say it s burned  he said  it s a great pity  and he gazed straight before him  absently stroking his mustache with his fingers and so you have met count nicholas  mary  prince andrew suddenly said evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them  he wrote here that he took a great liking to you  he went on simply and calmly  evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people  if you liked him too  it would be a good thing for you to get married  he added rather more quickly  as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking princess mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her  except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living why talk of me  she said quietly and glanced at natasha natasha  who felt her glance  did not look at her  all three were again silent andrew  would you like  princess mary suddenly said in a trembling voice  would you like to see little nicholas  he is always talking about you prince andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time  but princess mary  who knew his face so well  saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son  but with quiet  gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him yes  i shall be very glad to see him  is he quite well when little nicholas was brought into prince andrew s room he looked at his father with frightened eyes  but did not cry  because no one else was crying  prince andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him when nicholas had been led away  princess mary again went up to her brother  kissed him  and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry he looked at her attentively is it about nicholas  he asked princess mary nodded her head  weeping mary  you know the gosp  but he broke off what did you say nothing  you mustn t cry here  he said  looking at her with the same cold expression when princess mary began to cry  he understood that she was crying at the thought that little nicholas would be left without a father  with a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view yes  to them it must seem sad  he thought  but how simple it is the fowls of the air sow not  neither do they reap  yet your father feedeth them  he said to himself and wished to say to princess mary but no  they will take it their own way  they won t understand  they can t understand that all those feelings they prize so all our feelings  all those ideas that seem so important to us  are unnecessary we cannot understand one another  and he remained silent prince andrew s little son was seven  he could scarcely read  and knew nothing  after that day he lived through many things  gaining knowledge observation  and experience  but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired  he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father  mary  and natasha  than he had then  he understood it completely  and  leaving the room without crying  went silently up to natasha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful  thoughtful eyes  then his uplifted  rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry after that he avoided dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to princess mary  or to natasha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt  and clung to them quietly and shyly when princess mary had left prince andrew she fully understood what natasha s face had told her  she did not speak any more to natasha of hopes of saving his life  she took turns with her beside his sofa  and did not cry any more  but prayed continually  turning in soul to that eternal and unfathomable  whose presence above the dying man was now so evident chapter xvi not only did prince andrew know he would die  but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead  he was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming  that inexorable eternal  distant  and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life was now near to him and  by the strange lightness he experienced  almost comprehensible and palpable formerly he had feared the end  he had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death the end but now he no longer understood that fear he had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him  and he looked at the fallow field  the bushes  and the sky  and knew that he was face to face with death  when he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal  unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it  he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it during the hours of solitude  suffering  and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded  the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him  the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life  to love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone  not to live this earthly life  and the more imbued he became with that principle of love  the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which in the absence of such love stands between life and death  when during those first days he remembered that he would have to die  he said to himself  well  what of it  so much the better but after the night in mytishchi when  half delirious  he had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and  having pressed her hand to his lips  had shed gentle  happy tears  love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life  and joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind  recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen kuragin  he could not now regain the feeling he then had  but was tormented by the question whether kuragin was alive  and he dared not inquire his illness pursued its normal physical course  but what natasha referred to when she said  this suddenly happened  had occurred two days before princess mary arrived  it was the last spiritual struggle between life and death  in which death gained the victory  it was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for natasha  and a last  though ultimately vanquished  attack of terror before the unknown it was evening  as usual after dinner he was slightly feverish  and his thoughts were preternaturally clear  sonya was sitting by the table  he began to doze  suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him ah  she has come  thought he and so it was  in sonya s place sat natasha who had just come in noiselessly since she had begun looking after him  he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness  she was sitting in an armchair placed sideways  screening the light of the candle from him  and was knitting a stocking  she had learned to knit stockings since prince andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings  and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings  the needles clicked lightly in her slender rapidly moving hands  and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face  she moved  and the ball rolled off her knees  she started  glanced round at him  and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement  picked up the ball and regained her former position he looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping  but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously at the troitsa monastery they had spoken of the past  and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank god for his wound which had brought them together again  but after that they never spoke of the future can it or can it not be  he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles  can fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die  is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that i have spent my life in falsity  i love her more than anything in the world  but what am i to do if i love her  he thought  and he involuntarily groaned from a habit acquired during his sufferings on hearing that sound natasha put down the stocking  leaned nearer to him  and suddenly  noticing his shining eyes  stepped lightly up to him and bent over him you are not asleep no  i have been looking at you a long time  i felt you come in  no one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do  that light i want to weep for joy natasha drew closer to him  her face shone with rapturous joy natasha  i love you too much  more than anything in the world and i she turned away for an instant  why too much  she asked why too much  well  what do you  what do you feel in your soul  your whole soul shall i live  what do you think i am sure of it  sure  natasha almost shouted  taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement he remained silent awhile how good it would be  and taking her hand he kissed it natasha felt happy and agitated  but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet but you have not slept  she said  repressing her joy  try to sleep please he pressed her hand and released it  and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position  twice she turned and looked at him  and her eyes met his beaming at her  she set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished soon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep  he did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration as he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind about life and death  and chiefly about death he felt himself nearer to it love  what is love  he thought love hinders death  love is life  all  everything that i understand  i understand only because i love  everything is  everything exists  only because i love  everything is united by it alone  love is god  and to die means that i  a particle of love  shall return to the general and eternal source  these thoughts seemed to him comforting  but they were only thoughts  something was lacking in them  they were not clear  they were too one sidedly personal and brain spun  and there was the former agitation and obscurity  he fell asleep he dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in  but that he was quite well and unwounded  many various  indifferent  and insignificant people appeared before him  he talked to them and discussed something trivial  they were preparing to go away somewhere prince andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares  but he continued to speak  surprising them by empty witticisms  gradually  unnoticed  all these persons began to disappear and a single question  that of the closed door  superseded all else  he rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it  everything depended on whether he was  or was not  in time to lock it  he went  and tried to hurry  but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers  he was seized by an agonizing fear  and that fear was the fear of death  it stood behind the door  but just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door  that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in  something not human death was breaking in through that door  and had to be kept out  he seized the door  making a final effort to hold it back to lock it was no longer possible but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door  pushed from behind by that terror  opened and closed again once again it pushed from outside  his last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened  it entered  and it was death  and prince andrew died but at the instant he died  prince andrew remembered that he was asleep and at the very instant he died  having made an effort  he awoke yes  it was death  i died and woke up  yes  death is an awakening and all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision  he felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated  and that strange lightness did not again leave him when  waking in a cold perspiration  he moved on the divan  natasha went up and asked him what was the matter  he did not answer and looked at her strangely  not understanding that was what had happened to him two days before princess mary s arrival  from that day  as the doctor expressed it  the wasting fever assumed a malignant character  but what the doctor said did not interest natasha  she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing from that day an awakening from life came to prince andrew together with his awakening from sleep  and compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream there was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening his last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way  both princess mary and natasha  who did not leave him  felt this  they did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him he was no longer there  he had left them  but on what reminded them most closely of him his body  both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep  nor did they ever talk to one another about him  they felt that they could not express in words what they understood they both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly  deeper and deeper away from them  and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right he confessed  and received communion  everyone came to take leave of him  when they brought his son to him  he pressed his lips to the boy s and turned away  not because he felt it hard and sad princess mary and natasha understood that  but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him  but when they told him to bless the boy  he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do when the last convulsions of the body  which the spirit was leaving occurred  princess mary and natasha were present is it over  said princess mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless  growing cold before them  natasha went up  looked at the dead eyes  and hastened to close them  she closed them but did not kiss them  but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him his body where has he gone  where is he now when the body  washed and dressed  lay in the coffin on a table everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept little nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity the countess and sonya cried from pity for natasha and because he was no more  the old count cried because he felt that before long  he  too must take the same terrible step natasha and princess mary also wept now  but not because of their own personal grief  they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence book thirteen  chapter i man s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness  but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man s soul  and without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause  he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says this is the cause  in historical events where the actions of men are the subject of observation  the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and  after that  the will of those who stood in the most prominent position the heroes of history but we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled  it may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that  yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the west moved on the east because napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen  as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth  but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets  there is  and can be  no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes  but there are laws directing events  and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend the discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth the historians consider that  next to the battle of borodino and the occupation of moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire  the most important episode of the war of  was the movement of the russian army from the ryazana to the kaluga road and to the tarutino camp the so called flank march across the krasnaya pakhra river  they ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due  even foreign historians  including the french acknowledge the genius of the russian commanders when they speak of that flank march  but it is hard to understand why military writers  and following them others  consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved russia and destroyed napoleon  in the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay  for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions  and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from moscow in  was on the kaluga road  so it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one  and it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save russia and destroy the french  for this flank march  had it been preceded  accompanied  or followed by other circumstances  might have proved ruinous to the russians and salutary for the french  if the position of the russian army really began to improve from the time of that march  it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it that flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the russian army  but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction  what would have happened had moscow not burned down  if murat had not lost sight of the russians  if napoleon had not remained inactive  if the russian army at krasnaya pakhra had given battle as bennigsen and barclay advised  what would have happened had the french attacked the russians while they were marching beyond the pakhra  what would have happened if on approaching tarutino  napoleon had attacked the russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at smolensk  what would have happened had the french moved on petersburg  in any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous the third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man  that no one ever foresaw it  and that in reality  like the retreat from fili  it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety  but resulted moment by moment  step by step  event by event from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past at the council at fili the prevailing thought in the minds of the russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself  namely  a direct retreat by the nizhni road  in proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat  and above all there is the well known conversation after the council  between the commander in chief and lanskoy  who was in charge of the commissariat department  lanskoy informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the oka in the tula and ryazan provinces  and that if they retreated on nizhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river oka  which cannot be crossed early in winter  this was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course a direct retreat on nizhni novgorod  the army turned more to the south along the ryazan road and nearer to its supplies  subsequently the inactivity of the french who even lost sight of the russian army concern for the safety of the arsenal at tula  and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the tula road  having crossed over  by a forced march  to the tula road beyond the pakhra  the russian commanders intended to remain at podolsk and had no thought of the tarutino position  but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of french troops who had for a time lost touch with the russians  and projects of giving battle  and above all the abundance of provisions in kaluga province  obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the tula to the kaluga road and go to tarutino  which was between the roads along which those supplies lay  just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon moscow  so it is impossible to say precisely when  or by whom  it was decided to move to tarutino  only when the army had got there  as the result of innumerable and varying forces  did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result chapter ii the famous flank movement merely consisted in this  after the advance of the french had ceased  the russian army  which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders  deviated from that direct course and  not finding itself pursued  was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant if instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the russian army  we picture that army without any leaders  it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward moscow  describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest that movement from the nizhni to the ryazan  tula  and kaluga roads was so natural that even the russian marauders moved in that direction  and demands were sent from petersburg for kutuzov to take his army that way at tarutino kutuzov received what was almost a reprimand from the emperor for having moved his army along the ryazan road  and the emperor s letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near kaluga having rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of borodino  the russian army when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received assumed the position natural to it kutuzov s merit lay  not in any strategic maneuver of genius  as it is called  but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened  he alone then understood the meaning of the french army s inactivity  he alone continued to assert that the battle of borodino had been a victory  he alone who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack employed his whole strength to restrain the russian army from useless engagements the beast wounded at borodino was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him  but whether he was still alive  whether he was strong and merely lying low  the hunter did not know  suddenly the beast was heard to moan the moan of that wounded beast the french army  which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of lauriston to kutuzov s camp with overtures for peace napoleon  with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right  wrote to kutuzov the first words that occurred to him  though they were meaningless monsieur le prince koutouzov  i am sending one of my adjutants general to discuss several interesting questions with you  i beg your highness to credit what he says to you  especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard i have long entertained for your person  this letter having no other object  i pray god  monsieur le prince koutouzov  to keep you in his holy and gracious protection napoleon moscow  october  kutuzov replied  i should be cursed by posterity were i looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort  such is the present spirit of my nation  but he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking during the month that the french troops were pillaging in moscow and the russian troops were quietly encamped at tarutino  a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies both in spirit and in number as a result of which the superiority had passed to the russian side  though the condition and numbers of the french army were unknown to the russians  as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs  these signs were  lauriston s mission  the abundance of provisions at tarutino  the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the french  the flow of recruits to our regiments  the fine weather  the long rest the russian soldiers had enjoyed  and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for  which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting  curiosity as to what the french army  so long lost sight of was doing  the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the french stationed at tarutino  the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the french  the envy aroused by this the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every russian as long as the french were in moscow  and above all  a dim consciousness in every soldier s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side  there was a substantial change in the relative strength  and an advance had become inevitable  and at once  as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle  this change was shown by an increased activity  whirring  and chiming in the higher spheres chapter iii the russian army was commanded by kutuzov and his staff  and also by the emperor from petersburg  before the news of the abandonment of moscow had been received in petersburg  a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to kutuzov for his guidance  though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that moscow was still in our hands it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action  kutuzov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute  so fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered  as well as fresh people who were to watch kutuzov s actions and report upon them besides this  the whole staff of the russian army was now reorganized the posts left vacant by bagration  who had been killed  and by barclay who had gone away in dudgeon  had to be filled  very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put a in b s place and b in d s  or on the contrary to put d in a s place  and so on as if anything more than a s or b s satisfaction depended on this as a result of the hostility between kutuzov and bennigsen  his chief of staff  the presence of confidential representatives of the emperor  and these transfers  a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army  a was undermining b  d was undermining c  and so on in all possible combinations and permutations in all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war  which all these men believed they were directing  but this affair of the war went on independently of them  as it had to go  that is  never in the way people devised  but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses  only in the highest spheres did all these schemes  crossings  and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen prince michael ilarionovich  wrote the emperor on the second of october in a letter that reached kutuzov after the battle at tarutino  since september  moscow has been in the hands of the enemy  your last reports were written on the twentieth  and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital  but according to your last report you have even retreated farther  serpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and tula with its famous arsenal so indispensable to the army  is in danger  from general wintzingerode s reports  i see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the petersburg road  another corps of several thousand men is moving on dmitrov  a third has advanced along the vladimir road  and a fourth  rather considerable detachment is stationed between ruza and mozhaysk  napoleon himself was in moscow as late as the twenty fifth  in view of all this information  when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments  and with napoleon and his guards in moscow  is it possible that the enemy s forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive  on the contrary  he is probably pursuing you with detachments  or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you  it would seem that  availing yourself of these circumstances  you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him  or at least oblige him to retreat  retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy  and thereby averting danger from tula and other towns in the interior  you will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops  for with the army entrusted to you  and acting with resolution and energy  you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity  remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of moscow  you have experienced my readiness to reward you  that readiness will not weaken in me  but i and russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal firmness  and success which your intellect  military talent  and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting but by the time this letter  which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in petersburg  was dispatched kutuzov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place on the second of october a cossack  shapovalov  who was out scouting killed one hare and wounded another  following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of murat s army  encamped there without any precautions  the cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the french a cornet  hearing the story  informed his commander the cossack was sent for and questioned  the cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses  but one of the superior officers  who was acquainted with the higher authorities reported the incident to a general on the staff  the state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained  ermolov had been to see bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive if i did not know you i should think you did not want what you are asking for  i need only advise anything and his highness is sure to do the opposite  replied bennigsen the cossack s report  confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out  was the final proof that events had matured  the tightly coiled spring was released  the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play  despite all his supposed power  his intellect  his experience  and his knowledge of men  kutuzov having taken into consideration the cossack s report  a note from bennigsen who sent personal reports to the emperor  the wishes he supposed the emperor to hold  and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish could no longer check the inevitable movement and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful gave his approval  that is  to the accomplished fact chapter iv bennigsen s note and the cossack s information that the left flank of the french was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack  and it was fixed for the fifth of october on the morning of the fourth of october kutuzov signed the dispositions toll read them to ermolov  asking him to attend to the further arrangements all right all right  i haven t time just now  replied ermolov  and left the hut the dispositions drawn up by toll were very good  as in the austerlitz dispositions  it was written though not in german this time the first column will march here and here  the second column will march there and there  and so on  and on paper  all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions and as is always the case  not a single column reached its place at the appointed time when the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared  an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to ermolov to deal with  a young officer of the horse guards  kutuzov s orderly pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him  went to ermolov s quarters gone away  said ermolov s orderly the officer of the horse guards went to a general with whom ermolov was often to be found no  and the general s out too the officer  mounting his horse  rode off to someone else no  he s gone out if only they don t make me responsible for this delay  what a nuisance it is  thought the officer  and he rode round the whole camp  one man said he had seen ermolov ride past with some other generals  others said he must have returned home  the officer searched till six o clock in the evening without even stopping to eat  ermolov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was  the officer snatched a little food at a comrade s  and rode again to the vanguard to find miloradovich miloradovich too was away  but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at general kikin s and that ermolov was probably there too but where is it why  there  over at echkino  said a cossack officer  pointing to a country house in the far distance what  outside our line they ve put two regiments as outposts  and they re having such a spree there  it s awful  two bands and three sets of singers the officer rode out beyond our lines to echkino  while still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier s dance song proceeding from the house in the meadows  in the meadows  he heard  accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban  drowned every now and then by shouts  these sounds made his spirits rise  but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him  it was already past eight o clock  he dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the russian and french forces  in the refreshment room and the hall  footmen were bustling about with wine and viands  groups of singers stood outside the windows  the officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together  and among them ermolov s big imposing figure  they all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces laughing loudly  in the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trepak with much spirit and agility ha  ha  ha  bravo  nicholas ivanych  ha  ha  ha the officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame  and he would have preferred to wait  but one of the generals espied him and  hearing what he had come about  informed ermolov ermolov came forward with a frown on his face and  hearing what the officer had to say  took the papers from him without a word you think he went off just by chance  said a comrade  who was on the staff that evening  to the officer of the horse guards  referring to ermolov  it was a trick  it was done on purpose to get konovnitsyn into trouble  you ll see what a mess there ll be tomorrow chapter v next day the decrepit kutuzov  having given orders to be called early said his prayers  dressed  and  with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of  got into his caleche and drove from letashovka a village three and a half miles from tarutino  to the place where the attacking columns were to meet  he sat in the caleche  dozing and waking up by turns  and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun but all was still quiet  a damp dull autumn morning was just dawning  on approaching tarutino kutuzov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving  kutuzov looked at them searchingly  stopped his carriage  and inquired what regiment they belonged to  they belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then  it may be a mistake  thought the old commander in chief  but a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers  only partly dressed eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel  he sent for an officer  the officer reported that no order to advance had been received how  not rec  kutuzov began  but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer  getting out of his caleche  he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily  pacing silently up and down  when eykhen  the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned  appeared kutuzov went purple in the face  not because that officer was to blame for the mistake  but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on  trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground  and he fell upon eykhen  threatening him with his hands shouting and loading him with gross abuse  another man  captain brozin who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame  suffered the same fate what sort of another blackguard are you  i ll have you shot scoundrels  yelled kutuzov in a hoarse voice  waving his arms and reeling he was suffering physically  he  the commander in chief  a serene highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in russia  to be placed in this position made the laughingstock of the whole army  i needn t have been in such a hurry to pray about today  or have kept awake thinking everything over all night  thought he to himself  when i was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so  and now  he was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment  and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress  but his strength soon began to fail him  and looking about him  conscious of having said much that was amiss  he again got into his caleche and drove back in silence his wrath  once expended  did not return  and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and self justifications ermolov did not come to see him till the next day  and to the insistence of bennigsen  konovnitsyn and toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day  and once more kutuzov had to consent chapter vi next day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night  it was an autumn night with dark purple clouds  but no rain  the ground was damp but not muddy  and the troops advanced noiselessly  only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard  the men were forbidden to talk out loud  to smoke their pipes  or to strike a light  and they tried to prevent their horses neighing  the secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily  some columns  supposing they had reached their destination  halted  piled arms  and settled down on the cold ground but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been only count orlov denisov with his cossacks the least important detachment of all  got to his appointed place at the right time  this detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest  on the path leading from the village of stromilova to dmitrovsk toward dawn  count orlov denisov  who had dozed off  was awakened by a deserter from the french army being brought to him  this was a polish sergeant of poniatowski s corps  who explained in polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service  that he ought long ago to have been made an officer  that he was braver than any of them  and so he had left them and wished to pay them out  he said that murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were  and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive  count orlov denisov consulted his fellow officers the offer was too tempting to be refused  everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt  after much disputing and arguing major general grekov with two cossack regiments decided to go with the polish sergeant now  remember  said count orlov denisov to the sergeant at parting if you have been lying i ll have you hanged like a dog  but if it s true you shall have a hundred gold pieces without replying  the sergeant  with a resolute air  mounted and rode away with grekov whose men had quickly assembled  they disappeared into the forest  and count orlov denisov  having seen grekov off  returned shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility  and began looking at the enemy camp  now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires  our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right  he looked in that direction  but though the columns would have been visible quite far off  they were not to be seen it seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the french camp  and his keen sighted adjutant confirmed this oh  it is really too late  said count orlov  looking at the camp as often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes  it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor  that he had lied  and that the whole russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments  which he would lead away heaven only knew where  how could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops i am sure that rascal was lying  said the count they can still be called back  said one of his suite  who like count orlov felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy s camp eh  really  what do you think  should we let them go on or not will you have them fetched back fetch them back  fetch them back  said count orlov with sudden determination  looking at his watch  it will be too late  it is quite light and the adjutant galloped through the forest after grekov  when grekov returned  count orlov denisov  excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear  as well as by the proximity of the enemy  resolved to advance  all his men felt the same excitement mount  he commanded in a whisper  the men took their places and crossed themselves  forward  with god s aid hurrah ah ah  reverberated in the forest  and the cossack companies trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack  dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp one desperate  frightened yell from the first french soldier who saw the cossacks  and all who were in the camp  undressed and only just waking up  ran off in all directions  abandoning cannons  muskets  and horses had the cossacks pursued the french  without heeding what was behind and around them  they would have captured murat and everything there  that was what the officers desired  but it was impossible to make the cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners  none of them listened to orders  fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty eight guns were taken on the spot  besides standards and what seemed most important to the cossacks  horses  saddles  horsecloths  and the like  all this had to be dealt with  the prisoners and guns secured  the booty divided not without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves and it was on this that the cossacks all busied themselves the french  not being farther pursued  began to recover themselves  they formed into detachments and began firing  orlov denisov  still waiting for the other columns to arrive  advanced no further meantime  according to the dispositions which said that the first column will march  and so on  the infantry of the belated columns commanded by bennigsen and directed by toll  had started in due order and  as always happens  had got somewhere  but not to their appointed places  as always happens the men  starting cheerfully  began to halt murmurs were heard  there was a sense of confusion  and finally a backward movement  adjutants and generals galloped about  shouted  grew angry  quarreled  said they had come quite wrong and were late  gave vent to a little abuse  and at last gave it all up and went forward simply to get somewhere  we shall get somewhere or other  and they did indeed get somewhere  though not to their right places  a few eventually even got to their right place  but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at  toll  who in this battle played the part of weyrother at austerlitz  galloped assiduously from place to place finding everything upside down everywhere  thus he stumbled on bagovut s corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight  though the corps should long before have joined orlov denisov  excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it  toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely  saying that he ought to be shot  general bagovut  a fighting old soldier of placid temperament  being also upset by all the delay confusion  and cross purposes  fell into a rage to everybody s surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to toll i prefer not to take lessons from anyone  but i can die with my men as well as anybody  he said  and advanced with a single division coming out onto a field under the enemy s fire  this brave general went straight ahead  leading his men under fire  without considering in his agitation whether going into action now  with a single division  would be of any use or no  danger  cannon balls  and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood  one of the first bullets killed him  and other bullets killed many of his men  and his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly chapter vii meanwhile another column was to have attacked the french from the front but kutuzov accompanied that column  he well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will  and as far as was in his power held the troops back  he did not advance he rode silently on his small gray horse  indolently answering suggestions that they should attack the word attack is always on your tongue  but you don t see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers  said he to miloradovich who asked permission to advance we couldn t take murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time  and nothing can be done now  he replied to someone else when kutuzov was informed that at the french rear where according to the reports of the cossacks there had previously been nobody there were now two battalions of poles  he gave a sidelong glance at ermolov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day you see  they are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds  but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready  and the enemy forewarned  takes measures accordingly ermolov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words he understood that for him the storm had blown over  and that kutuzov would content himself with that hint he s having a little fun at my expense  said ermolov softly  nudging with his knee raevski who was at his side soon after this  ermolov moved up to kutuzov and respectfully remarked it is not too late yet  your highness the enemy has not gone away if you were to order an attack  if not  the guards will not so much as see a little smoke kutuzov did not reply  but when they reported to him that murat s troops were in retreat he ordered an advance  though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour the whole battle consisted in what orlov denisov s cossacks had done the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly in consequence of this battle kutuzov received a diamond decoration  and bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles  others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff that s how everything is done with us  all topsy turvy  said the russian officers and generals after the tarutino battle  letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so  just as people speak today  but people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves  no battle tarutino  borodino  or austerlitz takes place as those who planned it anticipated  that is an essential condition a countless number of free forces for nowhere is man freer than during a battle  where it is a question of life and death  influence the course taken by the fight  and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force if many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body  the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces  but will always be a mean what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces if in the descriptions given by historians  especially french ones  we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans  the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false the battle of tarutino obviously did not attain the aim toll had in view to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions  nor that which count orlov denisov may have had in view to take murat prisoner  nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps  which bennigsen and others may have had in view  nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself nor that of the cossack who wanted more booty than he got  and so on but if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the russians of that day desired to drive the french out of russia and destroy their army it is quite clear that the battle of tarutino  just because of its incongruities  was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign  it would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle  with a minimum of effort and insignificant losses  despite the greatest confusion  the most important results of the whole campaign were attained  the transition from retreat to advance  an exposure of the weakness of the french  and the administration of that shock which napoleon s army had only awaited to begin its flight chapter viii napoleon enters moscow after the brilliant victory de la moskowa  there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the french  the russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital  moscow  abounding in provisions  arms  munitions  and incalculable wealth  is in napoleon s hands  the russian army  only half the strength of the french  does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month  napoleon s position is most brilliant  he can either fall on the russian army with double its strength and destroy it  negotiate an advantageous peace  or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on petersburg  or even  in the case of a reverse  return to smolensk or vilna  or remain in moscow  in short  no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the french held at that time for that  only very simple and easy steps were necessary  not to allow the troops to loot  to prepare winter clothing of which there was sufficient in moscow for the whole army and methodically to collect the provisions  of which according to the french historians  there were enough in moscow to supply the whole army for six months  yet napoleon that greatest of all geniuses  who the historians declare had control of the army  took none of these steps he not merely did nothing of the kind  but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him  of all that napoleon might have done  wintering in moscow advancing on petersburg or on nizhni novgorod  or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route say by the road kutuzov afterwards took  nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did  he remained in moscow till october  letting the troops plunder the city  then  hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him  he quitted moscow  approached kutuzov without joining battle turned to the right and reached malo yaroslavets  again without attempting to break through and take the road kutuzov took  but retiring instead to mozhaysk along the devastated smolensk road  nothing more stupid than that could have been devised  or more disastrous for the army  as the sequel showed  had napoleon s aim been to destroy his army the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose independently of anything the russian army might do napoleon  the man of genius  did this  but to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to  or because he was very stupid  would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius in both cases his personal activity  having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier  merely coincided with the laws that guided the event the historians quite falsely represent napoleon s faculties as having weakened in moscow  and do so only because the results did not justify his actions  he employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army  as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in  his activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in egypt  in italy  in austria  and in prussia  we do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in egypt where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur for his great exploits there are all told us by frenchmen  we cannot accurately estimate his genius in austria or prussia  for we have to draw our information from french or german sources  and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in germany  but we  thank god  have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame  we have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply  and we will not abandon that right his activity in moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere  order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered moscow till the time he left it  the absence of citizens and of a deputation  and even the burning of moscow  did not disconcert him  he did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy  or of the welfare of the people of russia  or of the direction of affairs in paris  or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace chapter ix with regard to military matters  napoleon immediately on his entry into moscow gave general sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of the russian army  sent army corps out along the different roads  and charged murat to find kutuzov  then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the kremlin  and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of russia with regard to diplomatic questions  napoleon summoned captain yakovlev who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of moscow  minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity and having written a letter to the emperor alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his friend and brother that rostopchin had managed affairs badly in moscow  he dispatched yakovlev to petersburg having similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to tutolmin  he dispatched that old man also to petersburg to negotiate with regard to legal matters  immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries  and the scoundrel rostopchin was punished by an order to burn down his houses with regard to administrative matters  moscow was granted a constitution  a municipality was established and the following announcement issued inhabitants of moscow your misfortunes are cruel  but his majesty the emperor and king desires to arrest their course  terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime  strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re establish public security  a paternal administration  chosen from among yourselves  will form your municipality or city government  it will take care of you  of your needs  and of your welfare  its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder  and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well  but when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm the city police is established on its former footing  and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity  the government has appointed two commissaries general  or chiefs of police  and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city  you will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm  several churches of different denominations are open  and divine service is performed in them unhindered  your fellow citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes  these are the measures the government has adopted to re establish order and relieve your condition  but to achieve this aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should  if possible forget the misfortunes you have suffered  should entertain the hope of a less cruel fate  should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains of your property  and finally that you should not doubt that these will be safeguarded  since such is the will of the greatest and most just of monarchs  soldiers and citizens  of whatever nation you may be  re establish public confidence  the source of the welfare of a state  live like brothers  render mutual aid and protection one to another  unite to defeat the intentions of the evil minded  obey the military and civil authorities  and your tears will soon cease to flow with regard to supplies for the army  napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter moscow a la maraude  to obtain provisions for themselves  so that the army might have its future provided for  as looters with regard to religion  napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches with regard to commerce and to provisioning the army  the following was placarded everywhere proclamation you  peaceful inhabitants of moscow  artisans and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city  and you scattered tillers of the soil  still kept out in the fields by groundless fear  listen tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it  your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected  any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished  his majesty the emperor and king protects them  and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders  he desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families  respond  therefore  to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear  inhabitants  return with confidence to your abodes  you will soon find means of satisfying your needs  craftsmen and industrious artisans  return to your work  your houses  your shops where the protection of guards awaits you  you shall receive proper pay for your work  and lastly you too  peasants  come from the forests where you are hiding in terror  return to your huts without fear  in full assurance that you will find protection  markets are established in the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of the soil  the government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom of sale for them   from today  peasants  husbandmen  and those living in the neighborhood of moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets  of which one is on the mokhovaya street and the other at the provision market   such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may agree on  and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him under any pretense   sunday and wednesday of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on tuesdays and saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the carts   similar measures will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey   steps will immediately be taken to re establish ordinary trading inhabitants of the city and villages  and you  workingmen and artisans to whatever nation you belong  you are called on to carry out the paternal intentions of his majesty the emperor and king and to co operate with him for the public welfare  lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us with the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed  the emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants  and  despite his preoccupation with state affairs  himself visited the theaters that were established by his order in regard to philanthropy  the greatest virtue of crowned heads napoleon also did all in his power  he caused the words maison de ma mere to be inscribed on the charitable institutions  thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch  he visited the foundling hospital and  allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white hands  graciously conversed with tutolmin  then  as thiers eloquently recounts  he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged russian money which he had prepared  raising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself and of the french army  he let relief be distributed to those who had been burned out  but as food was too precious to be given to foreigners  who were for the most part enemies napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food from outside  and had paper rubles distributed to them with reference to army discipline  orders were continually being issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to suppress robbery chapter x but strange to say  all these measures  efforts  and plans which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances did not affect the essence of the matter but  like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism  swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels with reference to the military side the plan of campaign that work of genius of which thiers remarks that  his genius never devised anything more profound  more skillful  or more admirable  and enters into a polemic with m  fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of october that plan never was or could be executed  for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case  the fortifying of the kremlin  for which la mosquee as napoleon termed the church of basil the beatified  was to have been razed to the ground  proved quite useless  the mining of the kremlin only helped toward fulfilling napoleon s wish that it should be blown up when he left moscow as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten  the pursuit of the russian army  about which napoleon was so concerned  produced an unheard of result  the french generals lost touch with the russian army of sixty thousand men  and according to thiers it was only eventually found  like a lost pin  by the skill and apparently the genius of murat with reference to diplomacy  all napoleon s arguments as to his magnanimity and justice  both to tutolmin and to yakovlev whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance  proved useless alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage with regard to legal matters  after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of moscow burned down with regard to administrative matters  the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted moscow or saved their own property from being looted with regard to religion  as to which in egypt matters had so easily been settled by napoleon s visit to a mosque  no results were achieved  two or three priests who were found in moscow did try to carry out napoleon s wish  but one of them was slapped in the face by a french soldier while conducting service  and a french official reported of another that  the priest whom i found and invited to say mass cleaned and locked up the church  that night the doors were again broken open the padlocks smashed  the books mutilated  and other disorders perpetrated with reference to commerce  the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response  there were no industrious workmen  and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them as to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops these did not meet with success either  the theaters set up in the kremlin and in posnyakov s house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed even philanthropy did not have the desired effect  the genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded moscow lost its value  the french  collecting booty  cared only for gold  not only was the paper money valueless which napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate  but even silver lost its value in relation to gold but the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was napoleon s attempt to stop the looting and re establish discipline this is what the army authorities were reporting looting continues in the city despite the decrees against it  order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner  the sutlers alone venture to trade  and they sell stolen goods the neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the rd corps who  not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left  even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers  as i have repeatedly witnessed nothing new  except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging october robbery and pillaging continue  there is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force october the emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage  parties of marauding guards are continually seen returning to the kremlin  among the old guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening  last night  and today  the emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person  who should set an example of discipline  carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies  others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers  and have abused and beaten them the grand marshal of the palace  wrote the governor  complains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders  the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the emperor that army  like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation  disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in moscow  but it did not go away it began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the smolensk road  and by the battle of tarutino  the news of that battle of tarutino  unexpectedly received by napoleon at a review  evoked in him a desire to punish the russians thiers says  and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding fleeing from moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen  napoleon  too  carried away his own personal tresor  but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army  he was thiers says horror struck  and yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned  as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching moscow  he gazed at the caleches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing  as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions  the sick  and the wounded the plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing  to study the skillful tactics and aims of napoleon and his army from the time it entered moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal  very often a wounded animal hearing a rustle  rushes straight at the hunter s gun  runs forward and back again  and hastens its own end  napoleon  under pressure from his whole army  did the same thing  the rustle of the battle of tarutino frightened the beast  and it rushed forward onto the hunter s gun reached him  turned back  and finally like any wild beast ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path  where the old scent was familiar during the whole of that period napoleon  who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel acted like a child who  holding a couple of strings inside a carriage  thinks he is driving it chapter xi early in the morning of the sixth of october pierre went out of the shed  and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue gray dog  with a long body and short bandy legs  that jumped about him this little dog lived in their shed  sleeping beside karataev at night it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again probably it had never had an owner  and it still belonged to nobody and had no name  the french called it azor  the soldier who told stories called it femgalka  karataev and others called it gray  or sometimes flabby  its lack of a master  a name  or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue gray dog in the least  its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume  its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs  as if disdaining to use all four  everything pleased it  now it would roll on its back  yelping with delight  now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance  and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw pierre s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt the only remnant of his former clothing  a pair of soldier s trousers which by karataev s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth  and a peasant coat and cap  physically he had changed much during this time he no longer seemed stout  though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family  a beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face  and a tangle of hair  infested with lice  curled round his head like a cap  the look of his eyes was resolute  calm  and animatedly alert  as never before  the former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance  his feet were bare pierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning  then into the distance across the river  then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him  and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions  moving his dirty thick big toes  every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self satisfaction flitted across his face the sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him for some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in the mornings what is called an old wives  summer in the sunshine the air was warm  and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air on everything far and near lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time of autumn  the sparrow hills were visible in the distance with the village  the church  and the large white house  the bare trees the sand  the bricks and roofs of the houses  the green church spire and the corners of the white house in the distance  all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half burned mansion occupied by the french  with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence  and even that ruined and befouled house which in dull weather was repulsively ugly seemed quietly beautiful now  in the clear  motionless brilliance a french corporal  with coat unbuttoned in a homely way  a skullcap on his head  and a short pipe in his mouth  came from behind a corner of the shed and approached pierre with a friendly wink what sunshine  monsieur kiril  their name for pierre  eh  just like spring and the corporal leaned against the door and offered pierre his pipe though whenever he offered it pierre always declined it to be on the march in such weather  he began pierre inquired what was being said about leaving  and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day  sokolov  one of the soldiers in the shed with pierre  was dying  and pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him  the corporal replied that pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick  and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities besides  monsieur kiril  you have only to say a word to the captain you know  he is a man who never forgets anything  speak to the captain when he makes his round  he will do anything for you the captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with pierre and showed him all sorts of favors you see  st  thomas  he said to me the other day  monsieur kiril is a man of education  who speaks french  he is a russian seigneur who has had misfortunes  but he is a man  he knows what s what  if he wants anything and asks me  he won t get a refusal  when one has studied  you see  one likes education and well bred people  it is for your sake i mention it  monsieur kiril  the other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill and after chatting a while longer  the corporal went away  the affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before a fight between the prisoners and the french soldiers  in which pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades  some of the prisoners who had heard pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the frenchman had said while pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving moscow  a thin  sallow  tattered french soldier came up to the door of the shed  rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting  he asked pierre whether the soldier platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed a week before the french had had boot leather and linen issued to them which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them ready  ready  dear fellow  said karataev  coming out with a neatly folded shirt karataev  on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot  his hair was bound round  workman fashion  with a wisp of lime tree bast and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever a promise is own brother to performance  i said friday and here it is ready  said platon  smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn the frenchman glanced around uneasily and then  as if overcoming his hesitation  rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt  he had a long  greasy  flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow  thin bare body  but no shirt  he was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him  and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly  none of the prisoners said a word see  it fits well  platon kept repeating  pulling the shirt straight the frenchman  having pushed his head and hands through  without raising his eyes  looked down at the shirt and examined the seams you see  dear man  this is not a sewing shop  and i had no proper tools  and  as they say  one needs a tool even to kill a louse  said platon with one of his round smiles  obviously pleased with his work it s good  quite good  thank you  said the frenchman  in french  but there must be some linen left over it will fit better still when it sets to your body  said karataev still admiring his handiwork  you ll be nice and comfortable thanks  thanks  old fellow  but the bits left over  said the frenchman again and smiled  he took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to karataev  but give me the pieces that are over pierre saw that platon did not want to understand what the frenchman was saying  and he looked on without interfering  karataev thanked the frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work  the frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked pierre to translate what he said what does he want the bits for  said karataev  they d make fine leg bands for us  well  never mind and karataev  with a suddenly changed and saddened expression  took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the frenchman without looking at him  oh dear  muttered karataev and went away  the frenchman looked at the linen  considered for a moment  then looked inquiringly at pierre and  as if pierre s look had told him something  suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice platoche  eh  platoche  keep them yourself  and handing back the odd bits he turned and went out there  look at that  said karataev  swaying his head  people said they were not christians  but they too have souls  it s what the old folk used to say  a sweating hand s an open hand  a dry hand s close he s naked  but yet he s given it back karataev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces but they ll make grand leg bands  dear friend  he said  and went back into the shed chapter xii four weeks had passed since pierre had been taken prisoner and though the french had offered to move him from the men s to the officers  shed he had stayed in the shed where he was first put in burned and devastated moscow pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure  but thanks to his physical strength and health  of which he had till then been unconscious  and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began  he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully  and just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach he had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind  that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of borodino  he had sought it in philanthropy  in freemasonry  in the dissipations of town life  in wine  in heroic feats of self sacrifice and in romantic love for natasha  he had sought it by reasoning and all these quests and experiments had failed him  and now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death  through privation  and through what he recognized in karataev those dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important  it did not now occur to him to think of russia  or the war  or politics  or napoleon  it was plain to him that all these things were no business of his  and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so  russia and summer weather are not bound together  he thought  repeating words of karataev s which he found strangely consoling  his intention of killing napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous  his anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing  what concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred  what did it matter to anybody  and especially to him  whether or not they found out that their prisoner s name was count bezukhov he now often remembered his conversation with prince andrew and quite agreed with him  though he understood prince andrew s thoughts somewhat differently  prince andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative  but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied  but pierre believed it without any mental reservation  the absence of suffering the satisfaction of one s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one s occupation  that is  of one s way of life  now seemed to pierre to be indubitably man s highest happiness  here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat drinking when he wanted to drink  sleeping when he wanted to sleep  of warmth when he was cold  of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice  the satisfaction of one s needs good food  cleanliness  and freedom now that he was deprived of all this seemed to pierre to constitute perfect happiness  and the choice of occupation  that is  of his way of life now that that was so restricted seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one s needs  while great freedom in the choice of occupation such freedom as his wealth  his education  and his social position had given him in his own life is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation all pierre s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free  yet subsequently  and for the rest of his life  he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity  of those irrecoverable  strong joyful sensations  and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks when on the first day he got up early  went out of the shed at dawn  and saw the cupolas and crosses of the new convent of the virgin still dark at first  the hoarfrost on the dusty grass  the sparrow hills  and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from moscow across the field  and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun s rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud  and the cupolas and crosses  the hoarfrost  the distance and the river  all began to sparkle in the glad light pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known  and this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment  but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased that feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed  with his knowledge of languages  the respect shown him by the french  his simplicity  his readiness to give anything asked of him he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers  with his strength  which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut  his gentleness to his companions  and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything which seemed to them incomprehensible he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being  the very qualities that had been a hindrance  if not actually harmful  to him in the world he had lived in his strength  his disdain for the comforts of life  his absent mindedness and simplicity here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero  and pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him chapter xiii the french evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of october  kitchens and sheds were dismantled  carts loaded  and troops and baggage trains started at seven in the morning a french convoy in marching trim  wearing shakos and carrying muskets  knapsacks  and enormous sacks  stood in front of the sheds  and animated french talk mingled with curses sounded all along the lines in the shed everyone was ready  dressed  belted  shod  and only awaited the order to start  the sick soldier  sokolov  pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes  alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed his eyes  prominent from the emaciation of his face  gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him  and he moaned regularly and quietly  it was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan he had dysentery  as his fear and grief at being left alone pierre  girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes karataev had made for him from some leather a french soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with  went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him you know  sokolov  they are not all going away  they have a hospital here  you may be better off than we others  said pierre o lord  oh  it will be the death of me  o lord  moaned the man in a louder voice i ll go and ask them again directly  said pierre  rising and going to the door of the shed just as pierre reached the door  the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers  the corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps  and these changed their familiar faces the corporal came  according to orders  to shut the door  the prisoners had to be counted before being let out corporal  what will they do with the sick man  pierre began but even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger  so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment  moreover  just as pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides  the corporal frowned at pierre s words and  uttering some meaningless oaths  slammed the door  the shed became semidark  and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man s groans there it is  it again  said pierre to himself  and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine  in the corporal s changed face in the sound of his voice  in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums  he recognized that mysterious  callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions  to fear or to try to escape that force  to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools  was useless  pierre knew this now  one had to wait and endure  he did not again go to the sick man  nor turn to look at him  but stood frowning by the door of the hut when that door was opened and the prisoners  crowding against one another like a flock of sheep  squeezed into the exit  pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him  the captain was also in marching kit  and on his cold face appeared that same it which pierre had recognized in the corporal s words and in the roll of the drums pass on  pass on  the captain reiterated  frowning sternly  and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him pierre went up to him  though he knew his attempt would be vain what now  the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing pierre pierre told him about the sick man he ll manage to walk  devil take him  said the captain  pass on  pass on  he continued without looking at pierre but he is dying  pierre again began be so good  shouted the captain  frowning angrily dram da da dam  dam dam  rattled the drums  and pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more the officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front  there were about thirty officers  with pierre among them  and about three hundred men the officers  who had come from the other sheds  were all strangers to pierre and much better dressed than he  they looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully  as at an alien  not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow  bloated  angry face  who was wearing a kazan dressing gown tied round with a towel  and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners  he kept one hand  in which he clasped his tobacco pouch  inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other  panting and puffing  the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at another  a thin little officer  was speaking to everyone  conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day  an official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of moscow  loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see  a third officer  who by his accent was a pole  disputed with the commissariat officer  arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of moscow what are you disputing about  said the major angrily  what does it matter whether it is st  nicholas or st  blasius  you see it s burned down  and there s an end of it  what are you pushing for  isn t the road wide enough  said he  turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all oh  oh  oh  what have they done  the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins  all beyond the river  and zubova  and in the kremlin  just look  there s not half of it left  yes  i told you the whole quarter beyond the river  and so it is well  you know it s burned  so what s the use of talking  said the major as they passed near a church in the khamovniki one of the few unburned quarters of moscow  the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard ah  the villains  what heathens  yes  dead  dead  so he is  and smeared with something pierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations  and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church  from the words of his comrades who saw better than he did  he found that this was the body of a man  set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot go on  what the devil  go on  thirty thousand devils  the convoy guards began cursing and the french soldiers  with fresh virulence drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man chapter xiv through the cross streets of the khamovniki quarter the prisoners marched  followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort  but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles at the bridge they all halted  waiting for those in front to get across from the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them  to the right  where the kaluga road turns near neskuchny  endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance  these were troops of beauharnais  corps which had started before any of the others  behind  along the riverside and across the stone bridge  were ney s troops and transport davout s troops  in whose charge were the prisoners  were crossing the crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the kaluga road but the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of beauharnais train had not yet got out of moscow and reached the kaluga road when the vanguard of ney s army was already emerging from the great ordynka street when they had crossed the crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward  halted  and again moved on  and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together  they advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the kaluga road  taking more than an hour to do so  and came out upon the square where the streets of the transmoskva ward and the kaluga road converge  and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway  from all sides  like the roar of the sea  were heard the rattle of wheels  the tramp of feet  and incessant shouts of anger and abuse  pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house  listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums to get a better view  several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half burned house against which pierre was leaning what crowds  just look at the crowds  they ve loaded goods even on the cannon  look there  those are furs  they exclaimed  just see what the blackguards have looted  there  see what that one has behind in the cart  why  those are settings taken from some icons  by heaven  oh  the rascals  see how that fellow has loaded himself up  he can hardly walk  good lord  they ve even grabbed those chaises  see that fellow there sitting on the trunks  heavens they re fighting that s right  hit him on the snout on his snout  like this  we shan t get away before evening  look  look there  why  that must be napoleon s own  see what horses  and the monograms with a crown  it s like a portable house  that fellow s dropped his sack and doesn t see it  fighting again  a woman with a baby  and not bad looking either yes  i dare say  that s the way they ll let you pass  just look there s no end to it  russian wenches  by heaven  so they are  in carriages see how comfortably they ve settled themselves again  as at the church in khamovniki  a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road  and pierre  thanks to his stature  saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity  in three carriages involved among the munition carts  closely squeezed together  sat women with rouged faces  dressed in glaring colors  who were shouting something in shrill voices from the moment pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful  neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of moscow  all that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him as if his soul  making ready for a hard struggle  refused to receive impressions that might weaken it the women s vehicles drove by  behind them came more carts  soldiers wagons  soldiers  gun carriages  carriages  soldiers  ammunition carts more soldiers  and now and then women pierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement all these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power  during the hour pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly they all jostled one another  began to grow angry and to fight  white teeth gleamed  brows frowned  ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side  and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck pierre that morning on the corporal s face when the drums were beating it was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains  and the prisoners  hemmed in on all sides  emerged onto the kaluga road they marched very quickly  without resting  and halted only when the sun began to set  the baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their night s rest  they all appeared angry and dissatisfied  for a long time  oaths  angry shouts  and fighting could be heard from all sides  a carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole  several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides  some beat the carriage horses on their heads  turning them aside  others fought among themselves  and pierre saw that one german was badly wounded on the head by a sword it seemed that all these men  now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening  experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start  once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going  and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey during this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start  it was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration from the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners  in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations this spite increased still more when  on calling over the roll of prisoners  it was found that in the bustle of leaving moscow one russian soldier  who had pretended to suffer from colic  had escaped  pierre saw a frenchman beat a russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road  and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the russian  to the noncommissioned officer s excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk  the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind  pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions  but which he had not felt during his imprisonment  now again controlled his existence  it was terrible  but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him  there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it he ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades neither pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in moscow  or of the roughness of their treatment by the french  or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them  as if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay  they spoke of personal reminiscences  of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign  and avoided all talk of their present situation the sun had set long since  bright stars shone out here and there in the sky  a red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon  and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze  it grew light  the evening was ending  but the night had not yet come  pierre got up and left his new companions  crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed  he wanted to talk to them  on the road he was stopped by a french sentinel who ordered him back pierre turned back  not to his companions by the campfire  but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody  tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought  suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad  good natured laughter  so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean ha ha ha  laughed pierre  and he said aloud to himself  the soldier did not let me pass  they took me and shut me up  they hold me captive what  me  me  my immortal soul  ha ha ha  ha ha ha  and he laughed till tears started to his eyes a man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself  pierre stopped laughing  got up  went farther away from the inquisitive man  and looked around him the huge  endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet  the red campfires were growing paler and dying down  high up in the light sky hung the full moon  forests and fields beyond the camp  unseen before  were now visible in the distance  and farther still  beyond those forests and fields  the bright  oscillating  limitless distance lured one to itself  pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths  and all that is me  all that is within me and it is all i  thought pierre  and they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks  he smiled  and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions chapter xv in the early days of october another envoy came to kutuzov with a letter from napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from moscow  though napoleon was already not far from kutuzov on the old kaluga road kutuzov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by lauriston  saying that there could be no question of peace soon after that a report was received from dorokhov s guerrilla detachment operating to the left of tarutino that troops of broussier s division had been seen at forminsk and that being separated from the rest of the french army they might easily be destroyed  the soldiers and officers again demanded action  generals on the staff  excited by the memory of the easy victory at tarutino  urged kutuzov to carry out dorokhov s suggestion  kutuzov did not consider any offensive necessary the result was a compromise which was inevitable  a small detachment was sent to forminsk to attack broussier by a strange coincidence  this task  which turned out to be a most difficult and important one  was entrusted to dokhturov that same modest little dokhturov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles  dashing about in front of regiments  showering crosses on batteries  and so on  and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the russo french wars from austerlitz to the year  at austerlitz he remained last at the augezd dam  rallying the regiments  saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard  ill with fever he went to smolensk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against napoleon s whole army  in smolensk  at the malakhov gate  he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town and smolensk held out all day long  at the battle of borodino  when bagration was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the french artillery fire was directed against it  the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning dokhturov kutuzov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first  and the quiet little dokhturov rode thither  and borodino became the greatest glory of the russian army  many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose  but of dokhturov scarcely a word has been said it was dokhturov again whom they sent to forminsk and from there to malo yaroslavets  the place where the last battle with the french was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the french army began and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign  but of dokhturov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously  and this silence about dokhturov is the clearest testimony to his merit it is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part  the man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine  and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working on the tenth of october when dokhturov had gone halfway to forminsk and stopped at the village of aristovo  preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received  the whole french army having  in its convulsive movement  reached murat s position apparently in order to give battle suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new kaluga road and began to enter forminsk  where only broussier had been till then  at that time dokhturov had under his command  besides dorokhov s detachment  the two small guerrilla detachments of figner and seslavin on the evening of october  seslavin came to the aristovo headquarters with a french guardsman he had captured  the prisoner said that the troops that had entered forminsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army  that napoleon was there and the whole army had left moscow four days previously  that same evening a house serf who had come from borovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town  some cossacks of dokhturov s detachment reported having sighted the french guards marching along the road to borovsk  from all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole french army marching from moscow in an unexpected direction along the kaluga road  dokhturov was unwilling to undertake any action  as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do  he had been ordered to attack forminsk  but only broussier had been there at that time and now the whole french army was there  ermolov wished to act on his own judgment  but dokhturov insisted that he must have kutuzov s instructions  so it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff for this purpose a capable officer  bolkhovitinov  was chosen  who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth  besides delivering a written report  toward midnight bolkhovitinov  having received the dispatch and verbal instructions  galloped off to the general staff accompanied by a cossack with spare horses chapter xvi it was a warm  dark  autumn night  it had been raining for four days having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky  muddy road  bolkhovitinov reached litashevka after one o clock at night  dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard  general staff  and throwing down his reins  he entered a dark passage the general on duty  quick  it s very important  said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage he has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept  said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper  you should wake the captain first but this is very important  from general dokhturov  said bolkhovitinov  entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark the orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody your honor  your honor  a courier what  what s that  from whom  came a sleepy voice from dokhturov and from alexey petrovich  napoleon is at forminsk said bolkhovitinov  unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not konovnitsyn the man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself i don t like waking him  he said  fumbling for something  he is very ill  perhaps this is only a rumor here is the dispatch  said bolkhovitinov  my orders are to give it at once to the general on duty wait a moment  i ll light a candle  you damned rascal  where do you always hide it  said the voice of the man who was stretching himself to the orderly  this was shcherbinin  konovnitsyn s adjutant  i ve found it  i ve found it  he added the orderly was striking a light and shcherbinin was fumbling for something on the candlestick oh  the nasty beasts  said he with disgust by the light of the sparks bolkhovitinov saw shcherbinin s youthful face as he held the candle  and the face of another man who was still asleep this was konovnitsyn when the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up first blue and then red  shcherbinin lit the tallow candle  from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away  and looked at the messenger  bolkhovitinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve who gave the report  inquired shcherbinin  taking the envelope the news is reliable  said bolkhovitinov  prisoners  cossacks  and the scouts all say the same thing there s nothing to be done  we ll have to wake him  said shcherbinin rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat  peter petrovich  said he  konovnitsyn did not stir  to the general staff  he said with a smile  knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him and in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once  on konovnitsyn s handsome  resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs  but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance well  what is it  from whom  he asked immediately but without hurry blinking at the light while listening to the officer s report konovnitsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch  hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots  then he took off his nightcap  combed his hair over his temples and donned his cap did you get here quickly  let us go to his highness konovnitsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost  he did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad  that did not interest him  he regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else  there was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well  but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it  but must only attend to one s own work and he did his work  giving his whole strength to the task peter petrovich konovnitsyn  like dokhturov  seems to have been included merely for propriety s sake in the list of the so called heroes of the barclays  raevskis  ermolovs  platovs  and miloradoviches  like dokhturov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information  and like dokhturov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult  since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up  in battle he was always under fire  so that kutuzov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front  and like dokhturov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that  without clatter or noise  constitute the most essential part of the machine coming out of the hut into the damp  dark night konovnitsyn frowned partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him  of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news  especially bennigsen  who ever since tarutino had been at daggers drawn with kutuzov  and how they would make suggestions  quarrel  issue orders  and rescind them  and this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped and in fact toll  to whom he went to communicate the news  immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters  until konovnitsyn  who listened in weary silence  reminded him that they must go to see his highness chapter xvii kutuzov like all old people did not sleep much at night  he often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime  but at night  lying on his bed without undressing  he generally remained awake thinking so he lay now on his bed  supporting his large  heavy  scarred head on his plump hand  with his one eye open  meditating and peering into the darkness since bennigsen  who corresponded with the emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff  had begun to avoid him  kutuzov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements  the lesson of the tarutino battle and of the day before it  which kutuzov remembered with pain  must  he thought  have some effect on others too they must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive patience and time are my warriors  my champions  thought kutuzov  he knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green  it will fall of itself when ripe  but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled  the tree is harmed  and your teeth are set on edge  like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded  and wounded as only the whole strength of russia could have wounded it  but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question  now by the fact of lauriston and barthelemi having been sent  and by the reports of the guerrillas  kutuzov was almost sure that the wound was mortal  but he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait they want to run to see how they have wounded it  wait and we shall see  continual maneuvers  continual advances  thought he  what for only to distinguish themselves  as if fighting were fun  they are like children from whom one can t get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight  but that s not what is needed now and what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me  it seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies  he remembered the general plan sent him from petersburg  they have foreseen everything  but the contingencies are endless the undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at borodino was mortal or not had hung over kutuzov s head for a whole month  on the one hand the french had occupied moscow  on the other kutuzov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal  but in any case proofs were needed  he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited  lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing  he imagined all sorts of possible contingencies  just like the younger men  but with this difference  that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them  the longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves  he imagined all sorts of movements of the napoleonic army as a whole or in sections against petersburg  or against him  or to outflank him  he thought too of the possibility which he feared most of all  that napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in moscow awaiting him  kutuzov even imagined that napoleon s army might turn back through medyn and yukhnov  but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened the insane  convulsive stampede of napoleon s army during its first eleven days after leaving moscow  a stampede which made possible what kutuzov had not yet even dared to think of the complete extermination of the french  dorokhov s report about broussier s division  the guerrillas  reports of distress in napoleon s army  rumors of preparations for leaving moscow  all confirmed the supposition that the french army was beaten and preparing for flight  but these were only suppositions  which seemed important to the younger men but not to kutuzov  with his sixty years  experience he knew what value to attach to rumors  knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire  and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary  and the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it  this question absorbed all his mental powers  all else was to him only life s customary routine  to such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff  the letters he wrote from tarutino to madame de stael the reading of novels  the distribution of awards  his correspondence with petersburg  and so on  but the destruction of the french  which he alone foresaw  was his heart s one desire on the night of the eleventh of october he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that there was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of toll konovnitsyn  and bolkhovitinov eh  who s there  come in  come in  what news  the field marshal called out to them while a footman was lighting a candle  toll communicated the substance of the news who brought it  asked kutuzov with a look which  when the candle was lit  struck toll by its cold severity there can be no doubt about it  your highness call him in  call him here kutuzov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him  he screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully  as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind tell me  tell me  friend  said he to bolkhovitinov in his low  aged voice  as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest come nearer nearer  what news have you brought me  eh  that napoleon has left moscow  are you sure  eh bolkhovitinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report speak quicker  quicker  don t torture me  kutuzov interrupted him bolkhovitinov told him everything and was then silent  awaiting instructions  toll was beginning to say something but kutuzov checked him  he tried to say something  but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled  he waved his arm at toll and turned to the opposite side of the room  to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there o lord  my creator  thou has heard our prayer  said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands  russia is saved  i thank thee  o lord  and he wept chapter xviii from the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all kutuzov s activity was directed toward restraining his troops  by authority  by guile  and by entreaty  from useless attacks  maneuvers or encounters with the perishing enemy  dokhturov went to malo yaroslavets  but kutuzov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of kaluga a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible everywhere kutuzov retreated  but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction napoleon s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at tarutino and malo yaroslavets  and make conjectures as to what would have happened had napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces but not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces for the russian army did not bar his way  the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army  for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin  how could that army which had found abundant supplies in moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them  and on arriving at smolensk had looted provisions instead of storing them how could that army recuperate in kaluga province  which was inhabited by russians such as those who lived in moscow  and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze that army could not recover anywhere  since the battle of borodino and the pillage of moscow it had borne within itself  as it were  the chemical elements of dissolution the members of what had once been an army napoleon himself and all his soldiers fled without knowing whither  each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position  of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious so it came about that at the council at malo yaroslavets  when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions  all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple minded soldier mouton who  speaking last  said what they all felt  that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible  and no one  not even napoleon  could say anything against that truth which they all recognized but though they all realized that it was necessary to get away  there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee  an external shock was needed to overcome that shame  and this shock came in due time  it was what the french called le hourra de l empereur the day after the council at malo yaroslavets napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort  on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle  some cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the emperor and very nearly captured him  if the cossacks did not capture napoleon then  what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the french army  the booty on which the cossacks fell  here as at tarutino they went after plunder  leaving the men  disregarding napoleon they rushed after the plunder and napoleon managed to escape when les enfants du don might so easily have taken the emperor himself in the midst of his army  it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest  familiar road  napoleon with his forty year old stomach understood that hint  not feeling his former agility and boldness  and under the influence of the fright the cossacks had given him he at once agreed with mouton and issued orders as the historians tell us to retreat by the smolensk road that napoleon agreed with mouton  and that the army retreated  does not prove that napoleon caused it to retreat  but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the mozhaysk that is the smolensk  road acted simultaneously on him also chapter xix a man in motion always devises an aim for that motion  to be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles  one must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move the promised land for the french during their advance had been moscow during their retreat it was their native land  but that native land was too far off  and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself  today i shall get to a place twenty five miles off where i shall rest and spend the night  and during the first day s journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires  and the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd for the french retreating along the old smolensk road  the final goal their native land was too remote  and their immediate goal was smolensk  toward which all their desires and hopes  enormously intensified in the mass  urged them on  it was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in smolensk  nor that they were told so on the contrary their superior officers  and napoleon himself knew that provisions were scarce there  but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations  so both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves  and pushed on to smolensk as to a promised land coming out onto the highroad the french fled with surprising energy and unheard of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on  besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of french into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy  there was another cause binding them together their great numbers  as with the physical law of gravity their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself  in their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation each of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery  but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to smolensk  their goal  drew each of them in the same direction  on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company  and though the french availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext  such pretexts did not always occur  their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the russians to stop this movement  to which the french were directing all their energies  beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition a lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously  there is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow  on the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes of the russian commanders kutuzov alone understood this  when the flight of the french army along the smolensk road became well defined  what konovnitsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of october began to occur  the superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves  to cut off  to seize  to capture  and to overthrow the french  and all clamored for action kutuzov alone used all his power and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief  to prevent an attack he could not tell them what we say now  why fight  why block the road losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches  what is the use of that  when a third of their army has melted away on the road from moscow to vyazma without any battle  but drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand  he told them of the golden bridge  and they laughed at and slandered him  flinging themselves on rending and exulting over the dying beast ermolov  miloradovich  platov  and others in proximity to the french near vyazma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two french corps  and by way of reporting their intention to kutuzov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope and try as kutuzov might to restrain the troops  our men attacked trying to bar the road  infantry regiments  we are told  advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating  and killed and lost thousands of men but they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the french army closing up more firmly at the danger  continued  while steadily melting away  to pursue its fatal path to smolensk book fourteen  chapter i the battle of borodino  with the occupation of moscow that followed it and the flight of the french without further conflicts  is one of the most instructive phenomena in history all historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one another is expressed in wars  and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases strange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor having quarreled with another  collects an army  fights his enemy s army  gains a victory by killing three  five  or ten thousand men  and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions  all the facts of history as far as we know it  confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause  or at least an essential indication  of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army a hundredth part of a nation should oblige that whole nation to submit  an army gains a victory  and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated  an army has suffered defeat  and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse  and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated so according to history it has been found from the most ancient times and so it is to our own day  all napoleon s wars serve to confirm this rule  in proportion to the defeat of the austrian army austria loses its rights  and the rights and the strength of france increase  the victories of the french at jena and auerstadt destroy the independent existence of prussia but then  in  the french gain a victory near moscow  moscow is taken and after that  with no further battles  it is not russia that ceases to exist  but the french army of six hundred thousand  and then napoleonic france itself  to strain the facts to fit the rules of history  to say that the field of battle at borodino remained in the hands of the russians  or that after moscow there were other battles that destroyed napoleon s army  is impossible after the french victory at borodino there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious  yet the french army ceased to exist  what does this mean  if it were an example taken from the history of china we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon which is the historians  usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part  we might treat it as an exception  but this event occurred before our fathers  eyes  and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland  and it happened in the greatest of all known wars the period of the campaign of  from the battle of borodino to the expulsion of the french proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors  nor even in armies and battles  but in something else the french historians  describing the condition of the french army before it left moscow  affirm that all was in order in the grand army except the cavalry  the artillery  and the transport there was no forage for the horses or the cattle  that was a misfortune no one could remedy  for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the french have it the victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants karp and vlas who after the french had evacuated moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town  and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings  and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants  did not bring their hay to moscow for the high price offered them  but burned it instead let us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing  the fencing has gone on for some time  suddenly one of the combatants  feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life  throws down his rapier  and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it  then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and  desiring to conceal the facts of the case  insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art  one can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel the fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the french army  his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the russian people  those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event after the burning of smolensk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war  the burning of towns and villages  the retreats after battles  the blow dealt at borodino and the renewed retreat  the burning of moscow  the capture of marauders  the seizure of transports  and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules napoleon felt this  and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in moscow and instead of his opponent s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head  he did not cease to complain to kutuzov and to the emperor alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules as if there were any rules for killing people  in spite of the complaints of the french as to the nonobservance of the rules  in spite of the fact that to some highly placed russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules  and to make an adroit thrust en prime  and so on the cudgel of the people s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength  and without consulting anyone s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else  it rose and fell with stupid simplicity  but consistently  and belabored the french till the whole invasion had perished and it is well for a people who do not as the french did in salute according to all the rules of art  and  presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely  hand it to their magnanimous conqueror  but at the moment of trial  without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases  simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion chapter ii one of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass  such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character  in such actions  instead of two crowds opposing each other  the men disperse  attack singly  run away when attacked by stronger forces  but again attack when opportunity offers  this was done by the guerrillas in spain  by the mountain tribes in the caucasus  and by the russians in people have called this kind of war guerrilla warfare  and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning  but such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible  that rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict guerrilla war always successful  as history shows  directly infringes that rule this contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers  military science says that the more troops the greater the strength  les gros bataillons ont toujours raison   large battalions are always victorious for military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only  stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal momentum quantity of motion  is the product of mass and velocity in military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x military science  seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones  obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it now in a geometric formation  now in the equipment employed  now  and most usually  in the genius of the commanders  but the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts yet it is only necessary to abandon the false view adopted to gratify the heroes  of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders  in order to find this unknown quantity that unknown quantity is the spirit of the army  that is to say  the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army  quite independently of whether they are  or are not fighting under the command of a genius  in two or three line formation with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute  men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting the spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force  to define and express the significance of this unknown factor the spirit of an army is a problem for science this problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent such as the commands of the general  the equipment employed and so on mistaking these for the real significance of the factor  and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger  only then expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor  can we hope to define the unknown ten men  battalions  or divisions  fighting fifteen men  battalions  or divisions  conquer that is  kill or take captive all the others  while themselves losing four  so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost  consequently the four were equal to the fifteen  and therefore x  y  consequently x y   this equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns  and by bringing variously selected historic units battles campaigns  periods of war  into such equations  a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered the tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking  and in smaller groups in retreat  unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit  to lead men forward under fire more discipline obtainable only by movement in masses  is needed than is needed to resist attacks  but this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs  as in all national wars the french  retreating in though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together  the russians  on the contrary  ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass  but in fact they split up into small units  because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals  without orders  dealt blows at the french without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers chapter iii the so called partisan war began with the entry of the french into smolensk before partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government  thousands of enemy stragglers  marauders  and foragers had been destroyed by the cossacks and the peasants  who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death  denis davydov with his russian instinct  was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the french  and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare on august  davydov s first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized  the further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became the irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal  they gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree the french army and sometimes shook that tree itself  by october  when the french were fleeing toward smolensk  there were hundreds of such companies  of various sizes and characters  there were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry  artillery  staffs  and the comforts of life  others consisted solely of cossack cavalry  there were also small scratch groups of foot and horse  and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown  a sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month  and there was vasilisa  the wife of a village elder  who slew hundreds of the french the partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of october  its first period had passed  when the partisans themselves amazed at their own boldness  feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the french  and hid in the forests without unsaddling hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued  by the end of october this kind of warfare had taken definite shape  it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the french and what could not  now only the commanders of detachments with staffs  and moving according to rules at a distance from the french  still regarded many things as impossible  the small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the french closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate  the cossacks and peasants who crept in among the french now considered everything possible on october  denisov who was one of the irregulars  was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm  since early morning he and his party had been on the move  all day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large french convoy of cavalry baggage and russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army  which as was learned from spies and prisoners was moving under a strong escort to smolensk  besides denisov and dolokhov who also led a small party and moved in denisov s vicinity  the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and  as denisov expressed it  were sharpening their teeth for it  two of the commanders of large parties one a pole and the other a german sent invitations to denisov almost simultaneously  requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy no  bwother  i have gwown mustaches myself  said denisov on reading these documents  and he wrote to the german that  despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general  he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the polish general  to the polish general he replied to the same effect  informing him that he was already under the command of the german having arranged matters thus  denisov and dolokhov intended  without reporting matters to the higher command  to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces  on october  it was moving from the village of mikulino to that of shamshevo  to the left of the road between mikulino and shamshevo there were large forests  extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it  through these forests denisov and his party rode all day sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge  but never losing sight of the moving french  that morning cossacks of denisov s party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles  which had stuck in the mud not far from mikulino where the forest ran close to the road  since then and until evening  the party had watched the movements of the french without attacking  it was necessary to let the french reach shamshevo quietly without alarming them and then  after joining dolokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman s hut in the forest less than a mile from shamshevo  to surprise the french at dawn  falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides  and rout and capture them all at one blow in their rear  more than a mile from mikulino where the forest came right up to the road  six cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of french should show themselves beyond shamshevo  dolokhov was to observe the road in the same way  to find out at what distance there were other french troops  they reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men  denisov had two hundred  and dolokhov might have as many more  but the disparity of numbers did not deter denisov  all that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a tongue that is  a man from the enemy column  that morning s attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed  only a little drummer boy had been taken alive  and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column denisov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert  so he sent tikhon shcherbaty  a peasant of his party  to shamshevo to try and seize at least one of the french quartermasters who had been sent on in advance chapter iv it was a warm rainy autumn day  the sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water  at times a sort of mist descended  and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down denisov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides  like his horse which turned its head and laid its ears back  he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him  his thin face with its short  thick black beard looked angry beside denisov rode an esaul   denisov s fellow worker  also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap  and riding a large sleek don horse  a captain of cossacks esaul lovayski the third was a tall man as straight as an arrow  pale faced  fair haired  with narrow light eyes and with calm self satisfaction in his face and bearing  though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay  yet at first glance at the esaul and denisov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse  while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse  but a man who was one with his horse a being consequently possessed of twofold strength a little ahead of them walked a peasant guide  wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap a little behind  on a poor  small  lean kirghiz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth  rode a young officer in a blue french overcoat beside him rode an hussar  with a boy in a tattered french uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse  the boy held on to the hussar with cold  red hands  and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise  this was the french drummer boy captured that morning behind them along the narrow  sodden  cutup forest road came hussars in threes and fours  and then cossacks  some in felt cloaks  some in french greatcoats  and some with horsecloths over their heads  the horses being drenched by the rain  all looked black whether chestnut or bay their necks  with their wet  close clinging manes  looked strangely thin  steam rose from them  clothes  saddles  reins  were all wet slippery  and sodden  like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road  the men sat huddled up trying not to stir  so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats  their knees  and at the back of their necks  in the midst of the outspread line of cossacks two wagons  drawn by french horses and by saddled cossack horses that had been hitched on in front  rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts denisov s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his rider s knee against a tree oh  the devil  exclaimed denisov angrily  and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip  splashing himself and his comrades with mud denisov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger none of them had eaten anything since morning  and yet more because he still had no news from dolokhov and the man sent to capture a tongue had not returned there ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today it s too risky to attack them by oneself  and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses  thought denisov  continually peering forward hoping to see a messenger from dolokhov on coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right  denisov stopped there s someone coming  said he the esaul looked in the direction denisov indicated there are two  an officer and a cossack  but it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself  said the esaul  who was fond of using words the cossacks did not know the approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible  but they reappeared a few minutes later  in front  at a weary gallop and using his leather whip  rode an officer  disheveled and drenched  whose trousers had worked up to above his knees  behind him standing in the stirrups  trotted a cossack  the officer  a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes  galloped up to denisov and handed him a sodden envelope from the general  said the officer  please excuse its not being quite dry denisov  frowning  took the envelope and opened it there  they kept telling us  it s dangerous  it s dangerous  said the officer  addressing the esaul while denisov was reading the dispatch  but komarov and i he pointed to the cossack were prepared  we have each of us two pistols  but what s this  he asked noticing the french drummer boy  a prisoner  you ve already been in action  may i speak to him wostov  petya  exclaimed denisov  having run through the dispatch why didn t you say who you were  and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad the officer was petya rostov all the way petya had been preparing himself to behave with denisov as befitted a grownup man and an officer without hinting at their previous acquaintance  but as soon as denisov smiled at him petya brightened up blushed with pleasure  forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing  and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near vyazma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there well  i am glad to see you  denisov interrupted him  and his face again assumed its anxious expression michael feoklitych  said he to the esaul  this is again fwom that german  you know  he he indicated petya is serving under him and denisov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the german general s demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport if we don t take it tomowwow  he ll snatch it fwom under our noses  he added while denisov was talking to the esaul  petya abashed by denisov s cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it  while maintaining as martial an air as possible will there be any orders  your honor  he asked denisov  holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself  or shall i remain with your honor orders  denisov repeated thoughtfully  but can you stay till tomowwow oh  please  may i stay with you  cried petya but  just what did the genewal tell you  to weturn at once  asked denisov petya blushed he gave me no instructions  i think i could  he returned  inquiringly well  all wight  said denisov and turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman s hut in the forest  and told the officer on the kirghiz horse who performed the duties of an adjutant  to go and find out where dolokhov was and whether he would come that evening denisov himself intended going with the esaul and petya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to shamshevo  to have a look at the part of the french bivouac they were to attack next day well  old fellow  said he to the peasant guide  lead us to shamshevo denisov  petya  and the esaul  accompanied by some cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner  rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest chapter v the rain had stopped  and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees  denisov  the esaul  and petya rode silently  following the peasant in the knitted cap who  stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves silently led them to the edge of the forest he ascended an incline  stopped  looked about him  and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense  on reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves  he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand denisov and petya rode up to him  from the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the french  immediately beyond the forest  on a downward slope  lay a field of spring rye  to the right  beyond a steep ravine  was a small village and a landowner s house with a broken roof in the village  in the house  in the garden  by the well  by the pond over all the rising ground  and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village  not more than five hundred yards away crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist  their un russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts  and their calls to one another  could be clearly heard bwing the prisoner here  said denisov in a low voice  not taking his eyes off the french a cossack dismounted  lifted the boy down  and took him to denisov pointing to the french troops  denisov asked him what these and those of them were  the boy  thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows  looked at denisov in affright  but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers  merely assenting to everything denisov asked him  denisov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul  conveying his own conjectures to him petya  rapidly turning his head  looked now at the drummer boy  now at denisov  now at the esaul  and now at the french in the village and along the road  trying not to miss anything of importance whether dolokhov comes or not  we must seize it  eh  said denisov with a merry sparkle in his eyes it is a very suitable spot  said the esaul we ll send the infantwy down by the swamps  denisov continued they ll cweep up to the garden  you ll wide up fwom there with the cossacks he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village and i with my hussars fwom here  and at the signal shot the hollow is impassable there s a swamp there  said the esaul  the horses would sink  we must ride round more to the left while they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond  a puff of white smoke appeared  then another  and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry french voices shouting together came up from the slope  for a moment denisov and the esaul drew back  they were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting  but the firing and shouting did not relate to them  down below  a man wearing something red was running through the marsh  the french were evidently firing and shouting at him why  that s our tikhon  said the esaul so it is  it is the wascal  said denisov he ll get away  said the esaul  screwing up his eyes the man whom they called tikhon  having run to the stream  plunged in so that the water splashed in the air  and  having disappeared for an instant  scrambled out on all fours  all black with the wet  and ran on the french who had been pursuing him stopped smart  that  said the esaul what a beast  said denisov with his former look of vexation  what has he been doing all this time who is he  asked petya he s our plastun  i sent him to capture a tongue oh  yes  said petya  nodding at the first words denisov uttered as if he understood it all  though he really did not understand anything of it tikhon shcherbaty was one of the most indispensable men in their band he was a peasant from pokrovsk  near the river gzhat  when denisov had come to pokrovsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the french the elder  as though shielding himself  had replied  as all village elders did  that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them  but when denisov explained that his purpose was to kill the french  and asked if no french had strayed that way  the elder replied that some more orderers  had really been at their village  but that tikhon shcherbaty was the only man who dealt with such matters  denisov had tikhon called and  having praised him for his activity  said a few words in the elder s presence about loyalty to the tsar and the country and the hatred of the french that all sons of the fatherland should cherish we don t do the french any harm  said tikhon  evidently frightened by denisov s words  we only fooled about with the lads for fun  you know we killed a score or so of more orderers  but we did no harm else next day when denisov had left pokrovsk  having quite forgotten about this peasant  it was reported to him that tikhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it  denisov gave orders to let him do so tikhon  who at first did rough work  laying campfires  fetching water flaying dead horses  and so on  soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare  at night he would go out for booty and always brought back french clothing and weapons  and when told to would bring in french captives also  denisov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the cossacks tikhon did not like riding  and always went on foot  never lagging behind the cavalry  he was armed with a musketoon which he carried rather as a joke  a pike and an ax  which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth  with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones  tikhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm s length  or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons  in denisov s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position  when anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done to push a cart out of the mud with one s shoulders  pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail  skin it  slink in among the french  or walk more than thirty miles in a day everybody pointed laughingly at tikhon it won t hurt that devil he s as strong as a horse  they said of him once a frenchman tikhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back  that wound which tikhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka  was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment jokes in which tikhon readily joined hallo  mate  never again  gave you a twist  the cossacks would banter him  and tikhon  purposely writhing and making faces  pretended to be angry and swore at the french with the funniest curses  the only effect of this incident on tikhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners he was the bravest and most useful man in the party  no one found more opportunities for attacking  no one captured or killed more frenchmen and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role  now he had been sent by denisov overnight to shamshevo to capture a tongue  but whether because he had not been content to take only one frenchman or because he had slept through the night  he had crept by day into some bushes right among the french and  as denisov had witnessed from above  had been detected by them chapter vi after talking for some time with the esaul about next day s attack which now  seeing how near they were to the french  he seemed to have definitely decided on  denisov turned his horse and rode back now  my lad  we ll go and get dwy  he said to petya as they approached the watchhouse denisov stopped  peering into the forest  among the trees a man with long legs and long  swinging arms wearing a short jacket  bast shoes  and a kazan hat  was approaching with long  light steps  he had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle  when he espied denisov he hastily threw something into the bushes  removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim  and approached his commander  it was tikhon  his wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self satisfied merriment  he lifted his head high and gazed at denisov as if repressing a laugh well  where did you disappear to  inquired denisov where did i disappear to  i went to get frenchmen  answered tikhon boldly and hurriedly  in a husky but melodious bass voice why did you push yourself in there by daylight  you ass  well  why haven t you taken one oh  i took one all right  said tikhon where is he you see  i took him first thing at dawn  tikhon continued  spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes  i took him into the forest  then i see he s no good and think i ll go and fetch a likelier one you see  what a wogue it s just as i thought  said denisov to the esaul  why didn t you bwing that one what was the good of bringing him  tikhon interrupted hastily and angrily that one wouldn t have done for you  as if i don t know what sort you want what a bwute you are  well i went for another one  tikhon continued  and i crept like this through the wood and lay down  he suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it  one turned up and i grabbed him  like this  he jumped up quickly and lightly  come along to the colonel  i said  he starts yelling  and suddenly there were four of them  they rushed at me with their little swords  so i went for them with my ax  this way  what are you up to  says i  christ be with you  shouted tikhon  waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest yes  we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles  said the esaul  screwing up his glittering eyes petya badly wanted to laugh  but noticed that they all refrained from laughing  he turned his eyes rapidly from tikhon s face to the esaul s and denisov s  unable to make out what it all meant don t play the fool  said denisov  coughing angrily  why didn t you bwing the first one tikhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming  foolish grin disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth that was why he was called shcherbaty the gap toothed  denisov smiled  and petya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which tikhon himself joined oh  but he was a regular good for nothing  said tikhon  the clothes on him poor stuff  how could i bring him  and so rude  your honor  why he says  i m a general s son myself  i won t go  he says you are a bwute  said denisov  i wanted to question but i questioned him  said tikhon  he said he didn t know much there are a lot of us  he says  but all poor stuff only soldiers in name  he says  shout loud at them  he says  and you ll take them all  tikhon concluded  looking cheerfully and resolutely into denisov s eyes i ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes that ll teach you to play the fool  said denisov severely but why are you angry  remonstrated tikhon  just as if i d never seen your frenchmen  only wait till it gets dark and i ll fetch you any of them you want three if you like well  let s go  said denisov  and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily tikhon followed behind and petya heard the cossacks laughing with him and at him  about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes when the fit of laughter that had seized him at tikhon s words and smile had passed and petya realized for a moment that this tikhon had killed a man  he felt uneasy  he looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart  but this uneasiness lasted only a moment  he felt it necessary to hold his head higher  to brace himself  and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow s undertaking  that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself the officer who had been sent to inquire met denisov on the way with the news that dolokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him denisov at once cheered up and  calling petya to him  said  well  tell me about yourself chapter vii petya  having left his people after their departure from moscow  joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment  from the time he received his commission and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of vyazma  petya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic  he was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army  but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be  and he was always in a hurry to get where he was not when on the twenty first of october his general expressed a wish to send somebody to denisov s detachment  petya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse  but when dispatching him he recalled petya s mad action at the battle of vyazma  where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent  he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the french and had there twice fired his pistol  so now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of denisov s  that was why petya had blushed and grown confused when denisov asked him whether he could stay  before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest petya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once  but when he saw the french and saw tikhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night  he decided  with the rapidity with which young people change their views  that the general  whom he had greatly respected till then  was a rubbishy german  that denisov was a hero  the esaul a hero and tikhon a hero too  and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty it was already growing dusk when denisov  petya  and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse  in the twilight saddled horses could be seen  and cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the french could not see the smoke  in the passage of the small watchhouse a cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton  in the room three officers of denisov s band were converting a door into a tabletop petya took off his wet clothes  gave them to be dried  and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table in ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it  on the table were vodka  a flask of rum  white bread  roast mutton  and salt sitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands  down which the grease trickled  petya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men  and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way so then what do you think  vasili dmitrich  said he to denisov  it s all right my staying a day with you  and not waiting for a reply he answered his own question  you see i was told to find out well  i am finding out  only do let me into the very  into the chief  i don t want a reward  but i want petya clenched his teeth and looked around  throwing back his head and flourishing his arms into the vewy chief  denisov repeated with a smile only  please let me command something  so that i may really command petya went on  what would it be to you  oh  you want a knife  he said  turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton and he handed him his clasp knife  the officer admired it please keep it  i have several like it  said petya  blushing heavens  i was quite forgetting  he suddenly cried  i have some raisins  fine ones  you know  seedless ones  we have a new sutler and he has such capital things  i bought ten pounds  i am used to something sweet  would you like some  and petya ran out into the passage to his cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins  have some  gentlemen  have some you want a coffeepot  don t you  he asked the esaul  i bought a capital one from our sutler  he has splendid things  and he s very honest  that s the chief thing  i ll be sure to send it to you  or perhaps your flints are giving out  or are worn out that happens sometimes  you know  i have brought some with me  here they are and he showed a bag a hundred flints  i bought them very cheap  please take as many as you want  or all if you like then suddenly  dismayed lest he had said too much  petya stopped and blushed he tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish  and running over the events of the day he remembered the french drummer boy  it s capital for us here  but what of him  where have they put him  have they fed him  haven t they hurt his feelings  he thought but having caught himself saying too much about the flints  he was now afraid to speak out i might ask  he thought  but they ll say  he s a boy himself and so he pities the boy  i ll show them tomorrow whether i m a boy  will it seem odd if i ask  petya thought  well  never mind  and immediately blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical  he said may i call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat  perhaps yes  he s a poor little fellow  said denisov  who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder  call him in  his name is vincent bosse  have him fetched i ll call him  said petya yes  yes  call him  a poor little fellow  denisov repeated petya was standing at the door when denisov said this  he slipped in between the officers  came close to denisov  and said let me kiss you  dear old fellow  oh  how fine  how splendid and having kissed denisov he ran out of the hut bosse  vincent  petya cried  stopping outside the door who do you want  sir  asked a voice in the darkness petya replied that he wanted the french lad who had been captured that day ah  vesenny  said a cossack vincent  the boy s name  had already been changed by the cossacks into vesenny vernal  and into vesenya by the peasants and soldiers  in both these adaptations the reference to spring vesna  matched the impression made by the young lad he is warming himself there by the bonfire  ho  vesenya  vesenya vesenny  laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness he s a smart lad  said an hussar standing near petya  we gave him something to eat a while ago  he was awfully hungry the sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness  and the drummer boy came to the door ah  c est vous  said petya  voulez vous manger  n ayez pas peur  on ne vous fera pas de mal   he added shyly and affectionately  touching the boy s hand  entrez  entrez   ah  it s you  do you want something to eat  don t be afraid  they won t hurt you   come in  come in merci  monsieur   said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice  and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold  thank you  sir there were many things petya wanted to say to the drummer boy  but did not dare to  he stood irresolutely beside him in the passage  then in the darkness he took the boy s hand and pressed it come in  come in  he repeated in a gentle whisper  oh  what can i do for him  he thought  and opening the door he let the boy pass in first when the boy had entered the hut  petya sat down at a distance from him considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him  but he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy chapter viii the arrival of dolokhov diverted petya s attention from the drummer boy to whom denisov had had some mutton and vodka given  and whom he had had dressed in a russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners  petya had heard in the army many stories of dolokhov s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the french  so from the moment he entered the hut petya did not take his eyes from him  but braced himself up more and more and held his head high  that he might not be unworthy even of such company dolokhov s appearance amazed petya by its simplicity denisov wore a cossack coat  had a beard  had an icon of nicholas the wonder worker on his breast  and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position  but dolokhov  who in moscow had worn a persian costume  had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the guards  he was clean shaven and wore a guardsman s padded coat with an order of st  george at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head  he took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room  and without greeting anyone went up to denisov and began questioning him about the matter in hand  denisov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport  of the message petya had brought  and his own replies to both generals  then he told him all he knew of the french detachment that s so  but we must know what troops they are and their numbers said dolokhov  it will be necessary to go there  we can t start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are  i like to work accurately  here now wouldn t one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the french camp with me  i have brought a spare uniform i  i  i ll go with you  cried petya there s no need for you to go at all  said denisov  addressing dolokhov  and as for him  i won t let him go on any account i like that  exclaimed petya  why shouldn t i go because it s useless well  you must excuse me  because  because  i shall go  and that s all  you ll take me  won t you  he said  turning to dolokhov why not  dolokhov answered absently  scrutinizing the face of the french drummer boy  have you had that youngster with you long  he asked denisov he was taken today but he knows nothing  i m keeping him with me yes  and where do you put the others  inquired dolokhov where  i send them away and take a weceipt for them  shouted denisov suddenly flushing  and i say boldly that i have not a single man s life on my conscience  would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort  instead of staining i speak bluntly staining the honor of a soldier that kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen  said dolokhov with cold irony  but it s time for you to drop it why  i ve not said anything  i only say that i ll certainly go with you  said petya shyly but for you and me  old fellow  it s time to drop these amenities continued dolokhov  as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated denisov  now  why have you kept this lad he went on  swaying his head  because you are sorry for him  don t we know those receipts  of yours  you send a hundred men away  and thirty get there  the rest either starve or get killed  so isn t it all the same not to send them the esaul  screwing up his light colored eyes  nodded approvingly that s not the point  i m not going to discuss the matter  i do not wish to take it on my conscience  you say they ll die  all wight  only not by my fault dolokhov began laughing who has told them not to capture me these twenty times over  but if they did catch me they d string me up to an aspen tree  and with all your chivalry just the same  he paused  however  we must get to work tell the cossack to fetch my kit  i have two french uniforms in it well  are you coming with me  he asked petya i  yes  yes  certainly  cried petya  blushing almost to tears and glancing at denisov while dolokhov had been disputing with denisov what should be done with prisoners  petya had once more felt awkward and restless  but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about  if grown up distinguished men think so  it must be necessary and right  thought he but above all denisov must not dare to imagine that i ll obey him and that he can order me about  i will certainly go to the french camp with dolokhov  if he can  so can i and to all denisov s persuasions  petya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow  and that he never considered personal danger for you ll admit that if we don t know for sure how many of them there are  hundreds of lives may depend on it  while there are only two of us  besides  i want to go very much and certainly will go  so don t hinder me  said he  it will only make things worse chapter ix having put on french greatcoats and shakos  petya and dolokhov rode to the clearing from which denisov had reconnoitered the french camp  and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow  on reaching the bottom  dolokhov told the cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge  petya  his heart in his mouth with excitement  rode by his side if we re caught  i won t be taken alive  i have a pistol  whispered he don t talk russian  said dolokhov in a hurried whisper  and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge  qui vive  and the click of a musket  who goes there the blood rushed to petya s face and he grasped his pistol lanciers du me   replied dolokhov  neither hastening nor slackening his horse s pace  lancers of the th regiment the black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge mot d ordre   password dolokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk dites donc  le colonel gerard est ici   he asked  tell me  is colonel gerard here mot d ordre  repeated the sentinel  barring the way and not replying quand un officier fait sa ronde  les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d ordre  cried dolokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel  je vous demande si le colonel est ici   when an officer is making his round  sentinels don t ask him for the password  i am asking you if the colonel is here and without waiting for an answer from the sentinel  who had stepped aside  dolokhov rode up the incline at a walk noticing the black outline of a man crossing the road  dolokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were  the man  a soldier with a sack over his shoulder  stopped  came close up to dolokhov s horse  touched it with his hand  and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm  as he called the landowner s house having ridden up the road  on both sides of which french talk could be heard around the campfires  dolokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner s house  having ridden in  he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire  around which sat several men talking noisily something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat  lit up by the fire  was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod oh  he s a hard nut to crack  said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire he ll make them get a move on  those fellows  said another  laughing both fell silent  peering out through the darkness at the sound of dolokhov s and petya s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses bonjour  messieurs   said dolokhov loudly and clearly  good day  gentlemen there was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire  and one tall  long necked officer  walking round the fire  came up to dolokhov is that you  clement  he asked  where the devil  but  noticing his mistake  he broke off short and  with a frown  greeted dolokhov as a stranger  asking what he could do for him dolokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment  and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the th regiment  none of them knew anything  and petya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and dolokhov with hostility and suspicion  for some seconds all were silent if you were counting on the evening soup  you have come too late  said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh dolokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night he handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck  that officer did not take his eyes from dolokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged  dolokhov  as if he had not heard the question  did not reply  but lighting a short french pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from cossacks those brigands are everywhere  replied an officer from behind the fire dolokhov remarked that the cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself  but probably they would not dare to attack large detachments  he added inquiringly  no one replied well  now he ll come away  petya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk but dolokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion how many battalions  and how many prisoners  asking about the russian prisoners with that detachment  dolokhov said a horrid business dragging these corpses about with one  it would be better to shoot such rabble  and burst into loud laughter  so strange that petya thought the french would immediately detect their disguise and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire no one replied a word to dolokhov s laughter  and a french officer whom they could not see he lay wrapped in a greatcoat  rose and whispered something to a companion  dolokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses will they bring our horses or not  thought petya  instinctively drawing nearer to dolokhov the horses were brought good evening  gentlemen  said dolokhov petya wished to say good night  but could not utter a word  the officers were whispering together  dolokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still  then he rode out of the yard at a footpace  petya rode beside him  longing to look round to see whether or not the french were running after them  but not daring to coming out onto the road dolokhov did not ride back across the open country  but through the village  at one spot he stopped and listened do you hear  he asked  petya recognized the sound of russian voices and saw the dark figures of russian prisoners round their campfires when they had descended to the bridge petya and dolokhov rode past the sentinel  who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it  then they descended into the hollow where the cossacks awaited them well now  good by  tell denisov  at the first shot at daybreak  said dolokhov and was about to ride away  but petya seized hold of him really  he cried  you are such a hero  oh  how fine  how splendid how i love you all right  all right  said dolokhov  but petya did not let go of him and dolokhov saw through the gloom that petya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him  dolokhov kissed him  laughed  turned his horse  and vanished into the darkness chapter x having returned to the watchman s hut  petya found denisov in the passage  he was awaiting petya s return in a state of agitation anxiety  and self reproach for having let him go thank god  he exclaimed  yes  thank god  he repeated  listening to petya s rapturous account  but  devil take you  i haven t slept because of you  well  thank god  now lie down  we can still get a nap before morning but  no  said petya  i don t want to sleep yet  besides i know myself  if i fall asleep it s finished  and then i am used to not sleeping before a battle he sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day then  noticing that denisov was asleep  he rose and went out of doors it was still quite dark outside  the rain was over  but drops were still falling from the trees  near the watchman s hut the black shapes of the cossacks  shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen  behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible  and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red  not all the cossacks and hussars were asleep  here and there  amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by  could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering petya came out  peered into the darkness  and went up to the wagons someone was snoring under them  and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats  in the dark petya recognized his own horse  which he called karabakh  though it was of ukranian breed  and went up to it well  karabakh  we ll do some service tomorrow  said he  sniffing its nostrils and kissing it why aren t you asleep  sir  said a cossack who was sitting under a wagon no  ah  likhachev isn t that your name  do you know i have only just come back  we ve been into the french camp and petya gave the cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object  and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act just anyhow well  you should get some sleep now  said the cossack no  i am used to this  said petya  i say  aren t the flints in your pistols worn out  i brought some with me  don t you want any  you can have some the cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at petya because i am accustomed to doing everything accurately  said petya some fellows do things just anyhow  without preparation  and then they re sorry for it afterwards  i don t like that just so  said the cossack oh yes  another thing  please  my dear fellow  will you sharpen my saber for me  it s got bl  petya feared to tell a lie  and the saber never had been sharpened  can you do it of course i can likhachev got up  rummaged in his pack  and soon petya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone  he climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge  the cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon i say  are the lads asleep  asked petya some are  and some aren t like us well  and that boy vesenny  oh  he s thrown himself down there in the passage  fast asleep after his fright  he was that glad after that petya remained silent for a long time  listening to the sounds  he heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared what are you sharpening  asked a man coming up to the wagon why  this gentleman s saber that s right  said the man  whom petya took to be an hussar  was the cup left here there  by the wheel the hussar took the cup it must be daylight soon  said he  yawning  and went away petya ought to have known that he was in a forest with denisov s guerrilla band  less than a mile from the road  sitting on a wagon captured from the french beside which horses were tethered  that under it likhachev was sitting sharpening a saber for him  that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman s hut  and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire  that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink  but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this  he was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality  the big dark blotch might really be the watchman s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth  perhaps the red spot was a fire  or it might be the eye of an enormous monster  perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon  but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which  if he fell  he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month  or go on falling and never reach the bottom  perhaps it was just the cossack  likhachev  who was sitting under the wagon  but it might be the kindest  bravest  most wonderful  most splendid man in the world  whom no one knew of  it might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow  but perhaps he had simply vanished disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness nothing petya could have seen now would have surprised him  he was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible he looked up at the sky  and the sky was a fairy realm like the earth it was clearing  and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars  sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing  and a clear black sky appeared  sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds  sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high  high overhead  and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one s hand petya s eyes began to close and he swayed a little the trees were dripping  quiet talking was heard  the horses neighed and jostled one another  someone snored ozheg zheg  ozheg zheg  hissed the saber against the whetstone  and suddenly petya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown sweetly solemn hymn  petya was as musical as natasha and more so than nicholas  but had never learned music or thought about it  and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive  the music became more and more audible  the melody grew and passed from one instrument to another  and what was played was a fugue though petya had not the least conception of what a fugue is each instrument now resembling a violin and now a horn  but better and clearer than violin or horn played its own part  and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air  and then with a third and a fourth  and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended  now into solemn church music  now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant oh why  that was in a dream  petya said to himself  as he lurched forward  it s in my ears  but perhaps it s music of my own  well  go on  my music  now he closed his eyes  and  from all sides as if from a distance  sounds fluttered  grew into harmonies  separated  blended  and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn  oh  this is delightful  as much as i like and as i like  said petya to himself  he tried to conduct that enormous orchestra now softly  softly die away  and the sounds obeyed him  now fuller more joyful  still more and more joyful  and from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds  now voices join in  ordered petya  and at first from afar he heard men s voices and then women s  the voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength  and petya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy with a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song  the drip from the trees  and the hissing of the saber  ozheg zheg zheg  and again the horses jostled one another and neighed  not disturbing the choir but joining in it petya did not know how long this lasted  he enjoyed himself all the time  wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it  he was awakened by likhachev s kindly voice it s ready  your honor  you can split a frenchman in half with it petya woke up it s getting light  it s really getting light  he exclaimed the horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails  and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches petya shook himself  jumped up  took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to likhachev  then he flourished the saber  tested it  and sheathed it the cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths and here s the commander  said likhachev denisov came out of the watchman s hut and  having called petya  gave orders to get ready chapter xi the men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness  tightened their saddle girths  and formed companies  denisov stood by the watchman s hut giving final orders  the infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn  hundreds of feet splashing through the mud  the esaul gave some orders to his men  petya held his horse by the bridle impatiently awaiting the order to mount  his face  having been bathed in cold water  was all aglow  and his eyes were particularly brilliant cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically well  is ev wything weady  asked denisov  bwing the horses the horses were brought  denisov was angry with the cossack because the saddle girths were too slack  reproved him  and mounted  petya put his foot in the stirrup  his horse by habit made as if to nip his leg  but petya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him  rode up to denisov vasili dmitrich  entrust me with some commission  please  for god s sake  said he denisov seemed to have forgotten petya s very existence  he turned to glance at him i ask one thing of you  he said sternly  to obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere he did not say another word to petya but rode in silence all the way when they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field  denisov talked in whispers with the esaul and the cossacks rode past petya and denisov  when they had all ridden by denisov touched his horse and rode down the hill  slipping onto their haunches and sliding  the horses descended with their riders into the ravine  petya rode beside denisov  the pulsation of his body constantly increasing  it was getting lighter and lighter  but the mist still hid distant objects  having reached the valley  denisov looked back and nodded to a cossack beside him the signal  said he the cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out  in an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard  shouts came from various sides and then more shots at the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting  petya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward  not heeding denisov who shouted at him  it seemed to petya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon  he galloped to the bridge cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him  on the bridge he collided with a cossack who had fallen behind  but he galloped on  in front of him soldiers  probably frenchmen  were running from right to left across the road  one of them fell in the mud under his horse s feet cossacks were crowding about a hut  busy with something  from the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose  petya galloped up  and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a frenchman clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him hurrah  lads  ours  shouted petya  and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street he could hear shooting ahead of him  cossacks  hussars  and ragged russian prisoners  who had come running from both sides of the road were shouting something loudly and incoherently  a gallant looking frenchman  in a blue overcoat  capless  and with a frowning red face had been defending himself against the hussars  when petya galloped up the frenchman had already fallen  too late again  flashed through petya s mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard  the shots came from the yard of the landowner s house he had visited the night before with dolokhov  the french were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the cossacks who crowded at the gateway through the smoke  as he approached the gate  petya saw dolokhov  whose face was of a pale greenish tint  shouting to his men  go round  wait for the infantry  he exclaimed as petya rode up to him wait  hurrah ah ah  shouted petya  and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest a volley was heard  and some bullets whistled past  while others plashed against something  the cossacks and dolokhov galloped after petya into the gateway of the courtyard  in the dense wavering smoke some of the french threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the cossacks  while others ran down the hill toward the pond  petya was galloping along the courtyard  but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely  slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle  his horse  having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light  stopped suddenly  and petya fell heavily on to the wet ground  the cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless  a bullet had pierced his skull after speaking to the senior french officer  who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered  dolokhov dismounted and went up to petya  who lay motionless with outstretched arms done for  he said with a frown  and went to the gate to meet denisov who was riding toward him killed  cried denisov  recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude very familiar to him in which petya s body was lying done for  repeated dolokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure  and he went quickly up to the prisoners  who were surrounded by cossacks who had hurried up  we won t take them  he called out to denisov denisov did not reply  he rode up to petya  dismounted  and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained  mud bespattered face which had already gone white i am used to something sweet  raisins  fine ones  take them all  he recalled petya s words  and the cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound  like the yelp of a dog  with which denisov turned away  walked to the wattle fence  and seized hold of it among the russian prisoners rescued by denisov and dolokhov was pierre bezukhov chapter xii during the whole of their march from moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the french authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was pierre  on the twenty second of october that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left moscow  half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by cossacks  the other half had gone on ahead  not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left  they had all disappeared  the artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by marshal junot s enormous baggage train  convoyed by westphalians  behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train from vyazma onwards the french army  which had till then moved in three columns  went on as a single group  the symptoms of disorder that pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving moscow had now reached the utmost limit the road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses  ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about  now joining the moving column  now again lagging behind it several times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets  fired  and run headlong  crushing one another  but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic these three groups traveling together the cavalry stores  the convoy of prisoners  and junot s baggage train still constituted a separate and united whole  though each of the groups was rapidly melting away of the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons  not more than sixty now remained  the rest had been captured or left behind  some of junot s wagons also had been captured or abandoned  three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from davout s corps  from the talk of the germans pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners  and that one of their comrades  a german soldier  had been shot by the marshal s own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession the group of prisoners had melted away most of all  of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from moscow fewer than a hundred now remained  the prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or junot s baggage  they understood that the saddles and junot s spoon might be of some use  but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry russians who froze and lagged behind on the road in which case the order was to shoot them  was not merely incomprehensible but revolting  and the escort  as if afraid  in the grievous condition they themselves were in of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse  treated them with particular moroseness and severity at dorogobuzh while the soldiers of the convoy  after locking the prisoners in a stable  had gone off to pillage their own stores  several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away  but were recaptured by the french and shot the arrangement adopted when they started  that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest  had long since been abandoned all who could walk went together  and after the third stage pierre had rejoined karataev and the gray blue bandy legged dog that had chosen karataev for its master on the third day after leaving moscow karataev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in moscow  and as he grew gradually weaker pierre kept away from him  pierre did not know why  but since karataev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him  when he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which karataev generally lay down at the halting places  and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before  pierre moved farther away and did not think about him while imprisoned in the shed pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being  by life itself  that man is created for happiness  that happiness is within him  in the satisfaction of simple human needs  and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity  and now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new  consolatory truth that nothing in this world is terrible  he had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free  so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom  he learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together  that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now  sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming  and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores his footgear having long since fallen to pieces  he discovered that when he had married his wife of his own free will as it had seemed to him he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable  of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings  but which at the time he scarcely felt  the worst was the state of his bare  raw  and scab covered feet the horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing  the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant  there was no great cold  it was always warm walking in the daytime  and at night there were the campfires  the lice that devoured him warmed his body the one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet after the second day s march pierre  having examined his feet by the campfire  thought it would be impossible to walk on them  but when everybody got up he went along  limping  and  when he had warmed up walked without feeling the pain  though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before  however  he did not look at them now but thought of other things only now did pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another  which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit he did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind  though more than a hundred perished in that way  he did not think of karataev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate  still less did pierre think about himself  the harder his position became and the more terrible the future  the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts  memories  and imaginings that came to him chapter xiii at midday on the twenty second of october pierre was going uphill along the muddy  slippery road  looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way  occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet  the former and the latter were alike familiar and his own  the blue gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road  sometimes in proof of its agility and self satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three  and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion  the dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in moscow  all around lay the flesh of different animals from men to horses in various stages of decomposition  and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted it had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear  but after a short break it began raining harder than before  the saturated road no longer absorbed the water which ran along the ruts in streams pierre walked along  looking from side to side  counting his steps in threes  and reckoning them off on his fingers  mentally addressing the rain  he repeated  now then  now then  go on  pelt harder it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing  but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting  this something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with karataev the day before at their yesterday s halting place  feeling chilly by a dying campfire pierre had got up and gone to the next one  which was burning better there platon karataev was sitting covered up head and all with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment  telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story pierre knew  it was already past midnight  the hour when karataev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively  when pierre reached the fire and heard platon s voice enfeebled by illness  and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze  he felt a painful prick at his heart  his feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away but there was no other fire  and pierre sat down  trying not to look at platon well  how are you  he asked how am i  if we grumble at sickness  god won t grant us death  replied platon  and at once resumed the story he had begun and so  brother  he continued  with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes  you see  brother pierre had long been familiar with that story  karataev had told it to him alone some half dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion  but well as he knew it  pierre now listened to that tale as to something new  and the quiet rapture karataev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to pierre  the story was of an old merchant who lived a good and god fearing life with his family  and who went once to the nizhni fair with a companion a rich merchant having put up at an inn they both went to sleep  and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut  a bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant s pillow  he was tried  knouted  and his nostrils having been torn off  all in due form  as karataev put it he was sent to hard labor in siberia and so  brother  it was at this point that pierre came up  ten years or more passed by  the old man was living as a convict  submitting as he should and doing no wrong  only he prayed to god for death  well  one night the convicts were gathered just as we are  with the old man among them  and they began telling what each was suffering for  and how they had sinned against god  one told how he had taken a life  another had taken two  a third had set a house on fire  while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing  so they asked the old man  what are you being punished for  daddy i  my dear brothers  said he  am being punished for my own and other men s sins  but i have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine  but have only helped my poorer brothers  i was a merchant  my dear brothers  and had much property  and he went on to tell them all about it in due order  i don t grieve for myself  he says  god  it seems  has chastened me only i am sorry for my old wife and the children  and the old man began to weep  now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant  where did it happen  daddy  he said  when and in what month  he asked all about it and his heart began to ache so he comes up to the old man like this  and falls down at his feet you are perishing because of me  daddy  he says  it s quite true lads  that this man  he says  is being tortured innocently and for nothing  i  he says  did that deed  and i put the knife under your head while you were asleep  forgive me  daddy  he says  for christ s sake karataev paused  smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire  and he drew the logs together and the old man said  god will forgive you  we are all sinners in his sight  i suffer for my own sins  and he wept bitter tears  well  and what do you think  dear friends  karataev continued  his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story what do you think  dear fellows  that murderer confessed to the authorities  i have taken six lives  he says he was a great sinner but what i am most sorry for is this old man  don t let him suffer because of me  so he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form  the place was a long way off  and while they were judging  what with one thing and another  filling in the papers all in due form the authorities i mean time passed  the affair reached the tsar  after a while the tsar s decree came  to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded  the paper arrived and they began to look for the old man  where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain  a paper has come from the tsar  so they began looking for him  here karataev s lower jaw trembled  but god had already forgiven him he was dead  that s how it was  dear fellows  karataev concluded and sat for a long time silent gazing before him with a smile and pierre s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance  by the rapturous joy that lit up karataev s face as he told it  and the mystic significance of that joy chapter xiv a vos places   suddenly cried a voice  to your places a pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners  from all sides came shouts of command  and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses  passing the prisoners at a trot  the expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority  the prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road  the convoy formed up the emperor  the emperor  the marshal  the duke  and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed  before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by  pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome  plump  white face  it was one of the marshals  his eye fell on pierre s large and striking figure  and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy the general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face  whipping up his skinny horse  several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them  their faces all looked excited and worried what did he say  what did he say  pierre heard them ask while the marshal was passing  the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd  and pierre saw karataev whom he had not yet seen that morning  he sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree  on his face besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently  there was now an expression of quiet solemnity karataev looked at pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears  evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him  but pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself  he made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away when the prisoners again went forward pierre looked round  karataev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two frenchmen were talking over his head  pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill from behind  where karataev had been sitting  came the sound of a shot pierre heard it plainly  but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to smolensk a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by  and he again started reckoning  two french soldiers ran past pierre  one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun  they both looked pale  and in the expression on their faces one of them glanced timidly at pierre there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution  pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that  two days before  that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him behind him  where karataev had been sitting  the dog began to howl what a stupid beast  why is it howling  thought pierre his comrades  the prisoner soldiers walking beside him  avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling just as pierre did  but there was a set look on all their faces chapter xv the stores  the prisoners  and the marshal s baggage train stopped at the village of shamshevo  the men crowded together round the campfires pierre went up to the fire  ate some roast horseflesh  lay down with his back to the fire  and immediately fell asleep  he again slept as he had done at mozhaysk after the battle of borodino again real events mingled with dreams and again someone  he or another gave expression to his thoughts  and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at mozhaysk life is everything  life is god  everything changes and moves and that movement is god  and while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine  to love life is to love god  harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in one s sufferings  in innocent sufferings karataev  came to pierre s mind and suddenly he saw vividly before him a long forgotten  kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in switzerland  wait a bit  said the old man  and showed pierre a globe  this globe was alive a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions  its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together  and all these drops moved and changed places  sometimes several of them merging into one  sometimes one dividing into many  each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible  but others striving to do the same compressed it sometimes destroyed it  and sometimes merged with it that is life  said the old teacher how simple and clear it is  thought pierre  how is it i did not know it before god is in the midst  and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect him to the greatest extent  and it grows  merges  disappears from the surface  sinks to the depths  and again emerges  there now  karataev has spread out and disappeared  do you understand  my child  said the teacher do you understand  damn you  shouted a voice  and pierre woke up he lifted himself and sat up  a frenchman who had just pushed a russian soldier away was squatting by the fire  engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod  his sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy hairy  red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod  his brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal it s all the same to him  he muttered  turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him  brigand  get away and twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at pierre  who turned away and gazed into the darkness  a prisoner  the russian soldier the frenchman had pushed away  was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand  looking more closely pierre recognized the blue gray dog sitting beside the soldier  wagging its tail ah  he s come  said pierre  and plat  he began  but did not finish suddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy of the look platon had given him as he sat under the tree  of the shot heard from that spot  of the dog s howl  of the guilty faces of the two frenchmen as they ran past him  of the lowered and smoking gun  and of karataev s absence at this halt and he was on the point of realizing that karataev had been killed  but just at that instant  he knew not why  the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful polish lady on the veranda of his house in kiev  and without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them  pierre closed his eyes  seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid  vibrating globe  and he sank into water so that it closed over his head before sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing french soldiers were running past him the cossacks  one of them shouted  and a moment later a crowd of russians surrounded pierre for a long time he could not understand what was happening to him  all around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy brothers  dear fellows  darlings  old soldiers exclaimed  weeping  as they embraced cossacks and hussars the hussars and cossacks crowded round the prisoners  one offered them clothes  another boots  and a third bread  pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word  he hugged the first soldier who approached him  and kissed him  weeping dolokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house  letting a crowd of disarmed frenchmen pass by  the french  excited by all that had happened  were talking loudly among themselves  but as they passed dolokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good  they became silent  on the opposite side stood dolokhov s cossack  counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate how many  dolokhov asked the cossack the second hundred  replied the cossack filez  filez   dolokhov kept saying  having adopted this expression from the french  and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light  get along  get along denisov  bareheaded and with a gloomy face  walked behind some cossacks who were carrying the body of petya rostov to a hole that had been dug in the garden chapter xvi after the twenty eighth of october when the frosts began  the flight of the french assumed a still more tragic character  with men freezing  or roasting themselves to death at the campfires  while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past  carrying away the property that had been stolen by the emperor  kings  and dukes  but the process of the flight and disintegration of the french army went on essentially as before from moscow to vyazma the french army of seventy three thousand men not reckoning the guards who did nothing during the whole war but pillage was reduced to thirty six thousand  though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle  from this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically  the french army melted away and perished at the same rate from moscow to vyazma  from vyazma to smolensk  from smolensk to the berezina  and from the berezina to vilna independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold  the pursuit  the barring of the way  or any other particular conditions beyond vyazma the french army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass  and so went on to the end  berthier wrote to his emperor we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army  and this is what he said i deem it my duty to report to your majesty the condition of the various corps i have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three days  march  they are almost disbanded  scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments  the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline  in general they regard smolensk as the place where they hope to recover  during the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms  in such a state of affairs  whatever your ultimate plans may be  the interest of your majesty s service demands that the army should be rallied at smolensk and should first of all be freed from ineffectives  such as dismounted cavalry  unnecessary baggage  and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces  the soldiers  who are worn out with hunger and fatigue  need these supplies as well as a few days  rest many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs  this state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement november  twenty miles from smolensk after staggering into smolensk which seemed to them a promised land  the french  searching for food  killed one another  sacked their own stores and when everything had been plundered fled farther they all went without knowing whither or why they were going  still less did that genius  napoleon  know it  for no one issued any orders to him but still he and those about him retained their old habits  wrote commands  letters  reports  and orders of the day  called one another sire  mon cousin  prince d eckmuhl  roi de naples  and so on  but these orders and reports were only on paper  nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out  and though they entitled one another majesties  highnesses  or cousins  they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay and though they pretended to be concerned about the army  each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself chapter xvii the movements of the russian and french armies during the campaign from moscow back to the niemen were like those in a game of russian blindman s bluff  in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts  first he rings his bell fearlessly  but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can  and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent s arms at first while they were still moving along the kaluga road  napoleon s armies made their presence known  but later when they reached the smolensk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the russians owing to the rapidity of the french flight and the russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses  the chief means of approximately ascertaining the enemy s position by cavalry scouting was not available  besides  as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army  even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time  if news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before  by the third day when something could have been done  that army was already two days  march farther on and in quite another position one army fled and the other pursued  beyond smolensk there were several different roads available for the french  and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was  might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new  but after a four days  halt the mob  with no maneuvers or plans  again began running along the beaten track  neither to the right nor to the left but along the old the worst road  through krasnoe and orsha expecting the enemy from behind and not in front  the french separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty four hours  in front of them all fled the emperor  then the kings  then the dukes  the russian army  expecting napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the dnieper which was the only reasonable thing for him to do themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at krasnoe  and here as in a game of blindman s buff the french ran into our vanguard  seeing their enemy unexpectedly the french fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright  but then they resumed their flight  abandoning their comrades who were farther behind then for three days separate portions of the french army first murat s the vice king s  then davout s  and then ney s ran  as it were  the gauntlet of the russian army  they abandoned one another  abandoned all their heavy baggage  their artillery  and half their men  and fled getting past the russians by night by making semicircles to the right ney  who came last  had been busying himself blowing up the walls of smolensk which were in nobody s way  because despite the unfortunate plight of the french or because of it  they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves  ney  who had had a corps of ten thousand men  reached napoleon at orsha with only one thousand men left having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon  and having crossed the dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot from orsha they fled farther along the road to vilna  still playing at blindman s buff with the pursuing army  at the berezina they again became disorganized  many were drowned and many surrendered  but those who got across the river fled farther  their supreme chief donned a fur coat and  having seated himself in a sleigh  galloped on alone abandoning his companions  the others who could do so drove away too leaving those who could not to surrender or die chapter xviii this campaign consisted in a flight of the french during which they did all they could to destroy themselves  from the time they turned onto the kaluga road to the day their leader fled from the army  none of the movements of the crowd had any sense  so one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians  who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man  would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory  but no mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign  and everywhere are described napoleon s arrangements  the maneuvers  and his profound plans which guided the army  as well as the military genius shown by his marshals the retreat from malo yaroslavets when he had a free road into a well supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which kutuzov afterwards pursued him this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road is explained to us as being due to profound considerations  similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from smolensk to orsha  then his heroism at krasnoe is described  where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command  and to have walked about with a birch stick and said j ai assez fait l empereur  il est temps de faire le general   but nevertheless immediately ran away again  abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind  i have acted the emperor long enough  it is time to act the general then we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals  especially of ney a greatness of soul consisting in this  that he made his way by night around through the forest and across the dnieper and escaped to orsha  abandoning standards  artillery  and nine tenths of his men and lastly  the final departure of the great emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius  even that final running away  described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of even that act finds justification in the historians  language when it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther  when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just  the historians produce a saving conception of greatness  greatness  it seems  excludes the standards of right and wrong  for the great  man nothing is wrong  there is no atrocity for which a great  man can be blamed c est grand   say the historians  and there no longer exists either good or evil but only grand  and not grand  grand is good  not grand is bad  grand is the characteristic  in their conception  of some special animals called heroes  and napoleon  escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were in his opinion  men he had brought there  feels que c est grand   and his soul is tranquil  it is great   that it is great du sublime he saw something sublime in himself  au ridicule il n y a qu un pas   said he  and the whole world for fifty years has been repeating  sublime  grand  napoleon le grand  du sublime au ridicule il n y a qu un pas  from the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step and it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one s own nothingness and immeasurable meanness for us with the standard of good and evil given us by christ  no human actions are incommensurable  and there is no greatness where simplicity goodness  and truth are absent chapter xix what russian  reading the account of the last part of the campaign of  has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret dissatisfaction  and perplexity  who has not asked himself how it is that the french were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers  when the disordered french  hungry and freezing  surrendered in crowds  and when as the historians relate the aim of the russians was to stop the french  to cut them off  and capture them all how was it that the russian army  which when numerically weaker than the french had given battle at borodino  did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the french on three sides and when its aim was to capture them  can the french be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them  how could that happen history or what is called by that name  replying to these questions says that this occurred because kutuzov and tormasov and chichagov  and this man and that man  did not execute such and such maneuvers but why did they not execute those maneuvers  and why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished  but even if we admitted that kutuzov  chichagov  and others were the cause of the russian failures  it is still incomprehensible why  the position of the russian army being what it was at krasnoe and at the berezina in both cases we had superior forces  the french army with its marshals  kings  and emperor was not captured  if that was what the russians aimed at the explanation of this strange fact given by russian military historians to the effect that kutuzov hindered an attack  is unfounded for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at vyazma and tarutino why was the russian army which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at borodino defeated at krasnoe and the berezina by the disorganized crowds of the french when it was numerically superior if the aim of the russians consisted in cutting off and capturing napoleon and his marshals and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the french to be a series of victories  and quite wrongly considered victorious by russian historians the russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion  and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor  devotion  and so forth  must reluctantly admit that the french retreat from moscow was a series of victories for napoleon and defeats for kutuzov but putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction  since the series of french victories brought the french complete destruction  while the series of russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country the source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals from memoirs  reports  projects  and so forth  have attributed to this last period of the war of  an aim that never existed  namely that of cutting off and capturing napoleon with his marshals and his army there never was or could have been such an aim  for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible it would have been senseless  first because napoleon s disorganized army was flying from russia with all possible speed  that is to say  was doing just what every russian desired  so what was the use of performing various operations on the french who were running away as fast as they possibly could secondly  it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight thirdly  it would have been senseless to sacrifice one s own troops in order to destroy the french army  which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that  though its path was not blocked  it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in december  namely a hundredth part of the original army fourthly  it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the emperor  kings  and dukes whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the russians  as the most adroit diplomatists of the time joseph de maistre and others  recognized  still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the french  when our own army had melted away to half before reaching krasnoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners  and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger all the profound plans about cutting off and capturing napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who  when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted  should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head  the only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry  but not even that could be said for those who drew up this project  for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds but besides the fact that cutting off napoleon with his army would have been senseless  it was impossible it was impossible first because as experience shows that a three mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans the probability of chichagov  kutuzov  and wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility  as in fact thought kutuzov  who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results secondly it was impossible  because to paralyze the momentum with which napoleon s army was retiring  incomparably greater forces than the russians possessed would have been required thirdly it was impossible  because the military term to cut off  has no meaning  one can cut off a slice of bread  but not an army  to cut off an army to bar its road is quite impossible  for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen  as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of krasnoe and of the berezina  it is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured  just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one s hand  men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics  as the germans did  but the french troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them  since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike fourthly and chiefly it was impossible  because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in  and the russian army in its pursuit of the french strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself during the movement of the russian army from tarutino to krasnoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers  that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town  half the men fell out of the army without a battle and it is of this period of the campaign when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats  was short of provisions and without vodka  and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost  when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained  when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails  not for a few hours only as in a battle  but for months  where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold  when half the army perished in a single month it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how miloradovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place  tormasov to another place  and chichagov should have crossed more than knee deep in snow  to somewhere else  and how so and so routed  and cut off  the french and so on and so on the russians  half of whom died  did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation  and they are not to blame because other russians  sitting in warm rooms  proposed that they should do what was impossible all that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals  and not the history of the events to them the words of miloradovich seem very interesting  and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received  but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them  for it does not come within the range of their investigation yet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events  and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution the aim of cutting off napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people  it could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable the people had a single aim  to free their land from invasion  that aim was attained in the first place of itself  as the french ran away  and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight  secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the french  and thirdly by the fact that a large russian army was following the french ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped the russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal  and the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head book fifteen    chapter i when seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror  substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes  but when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying  besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance  a spiritual wound  which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals  but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch after prince andrew s death natasha and princess mary alike felt this drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them  they dared not look life in the face  they carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact everything  a carriage passing rapidly in the street  a summons to dinner  the maid s inquiry what dress to prepare  or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy  seemed an insult  painfully irritated the wound  interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination  and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them only when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain  they spoke little even to one another  and when they did it was of very unimportant matters both avoided any allusion to the future  to admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory  still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead  it seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words  and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes continued abstention from speech  and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling but pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy princess mary  in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew  was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight  she received letters from her relations to which she had to reply  the room in which little nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough  alpatych came to yaroslavl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to moscow to the house on the vozdvizhenka street  which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs  life did not stand still and it was necessary to live  hard as it was for princess mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then  and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave natasha alone  yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them  she went through the accounts with alpatych  conferred with dessalles about her nephew  and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to moscow natasha remained alone and  from the time princess mary began making preparations for departure  held aloof from her too princess mary asked the countess to let natasha go with her to moscow and both parents gladly accepted this offer  for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of moscow doctors would be good for her i am not going anywhere  natasha replied when this was proposed to her  do please just leave me alone  and she ran out of the room  with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow after she felt herself deserted by princes mary and alone in her grief natasha spent most of the time in her room by herself  sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa  tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on  this solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it  as soon as anyone entered she got up quickly  changed her position and expression  and picked up a book or some sewing  evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go she felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which with a terrible questioning too great for her strength her spiritual gaze was fixed one day toward the end of december natasha  pale and thin  dressed in a black woolen gown  her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot  was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa  nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door she was gazing in the direction in which he had gone to the other side of life  and that other side of life  of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life  where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity she was gazing where she knew him to be  but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here  she now saw him again as he had been at mytishchi  at troitsa  and at yaroslavl she saw his face  heard his voice  repeated his words and her own  and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken there he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak  leaning his head on his thin pale hand  his chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised  his lips are firmly closed  his eyes glitter  and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead  one of his legs twitches just perceptibly  but rapidly  natasha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain  what is that pain like  why does he have that pain  what does he feel  how does it hurt him  thought natasha  he noticed her watching him  raised his eyes  and began to speak seriously one thing would be terrible  said he  to bind oneself forever to a suffering man  it would be continual torture  and he looked searchingly at her  natasha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say  she said  this can t go on it won t  you will get well quite well she now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt  she recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze i agreed  natasha now said to herself  that it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer  i said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him  but he understood it differently  he thought it would be dreadful for me  he then still wished to live and feared death and i said it so awkwardly and stupidly  i did not say what i meant  i thought quite differently  had i said what i thought  i should have said  even if he had to go on dying  to die continually before my eyes i should have been happy compared with what i am now  now there is nothing  nobody  did he know that  no  he did not and never will know it  and now it will never  never be possible to put it right  and now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her  only in her imagination natasha this time gave him a different answer  she stopped him and said  terrible for you  but not for me  you know that for me there is nothing in life but you  and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me  and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death  and in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now  i love thee  thee  i love  love she said  convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort she was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes  then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this  again everything was shrouded in hard  dry perplexity  and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was  and now  now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery  but at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears  dunyasha her maid  entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress come to your papa at once  please  said she with a strange  excited look  a misfortune  about peter ilynich  a letter  she finished with a sob chapter ii besides a feeling of aloofness from everybody natasha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family  all of them her father  mother  and sonya were so near to her  so familiar  so commonplace  that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late  and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility  she heard dunyasha s words about peter ilynich and a misfortune  but did not grasp them what misfortune  what misfortune can happen to them  they just live their own old  quiet  and commonplace life  thought natasha as she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her mother s room  his face was puckered up and wet with tears  he had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him  when he saw natasha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face pe  petya  go  go  she  is calling  and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair  he almost fell into it  covering his face with his hands suddenly an electric shock seemed to run through natasha s whole being terrible anguish struck her heart  she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying  but the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life  the sight of her father  the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door  made her immediately forget herself and her own grief she ran to her father  but he feebly waved his arm  pointing to her mother s door  princess mary  pale and with quivering chin  came out from that room and taking natasha by the arm said something to her natasha neither saw nor heard her  she went in with rapid steps  pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself  and then ran to her mother the countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position stretching out and beating her head against the wall  sonya and the maids were holding her arms natasha  natasha  cried the countess  it s not true  it s not true  he s lying  natasha  she shrieked  pushing those around her away  go away  all of you  it s not true  killed  ha  ha  ha it s not true natasha put one knee on the armchair  stooped over her mother  embraced her  and with unexpected strength raised her  turned her face toward herself  and clung to her mummy  darling  i am here  my dearest mummy  she kept on whispering  not pausing an instant she did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her demanded a pillow and hot water  and unfastened and tore open her mother s dress my dearest darling  mummy  my precious  she whispered incessantly  kissing her head  her hands  her face  and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks the countess pressed her daughter s hand  closed her eyes  and became quiet for a moment  suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness glanced vacantly around her  and seeing natasha began to press her daughter s head with all her strength  then she turned toward her daughter s face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it natasha  you love me  she said in a soft trustful whisper  natasha you would not deceive me  you ll tell me the whole truth natasha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness my darling mummy  she repeated  straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother and again in a futile struggle with reality her mother  refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life  escaped from reality into a world of delirium natasha did not remember how that day passed nor that night  nor the next day and night  she did not sleep and did not leave her mother  her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment  not explaining or consoling  but recalling her to life during the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes and natasha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak  the countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly how glad i am you have come  you are tired  won t you have some tea natasha went up to her  you have improved in looks and grown more manly  continued the countess  taking her daughter s hand mamma  what are you saying natasha  he is no more  no more and embracing her daughter  the countess began to weep for the first time chapter iii princess mary postponed her departure  sonya and the count tried to replace natasha but could not  they saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair  for three weeks natasha remained constantly at her mother s side  sleeping on a lounge chair in her room  making her eat and drink  and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender  caressing tones soothed her mother the mother s wounded spirit could not heal  petya s death had torn from her half her life  when the news of petya s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty  but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life  but the same blow that almost killed the countess  this second blow  restored natasha to life a spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and  strange as it may seem  just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join  physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within natasha s wound healed in that way  she thought her life was ended  but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life love was still active within her  love awoke and so did life prince andrew s last days had bound princess mary and natasha together this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another  princess mary put off her departure  and for three weeks looked after natasha as if she had been a sick child  the last weeks passed in her mother s bedroom had strained natasha s physical strength one afternoon noticing natasha shivering with fever  princess mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed  natasha lay down but when princess mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back i don t want to sleep  mary  sit by me a little you are tired try to sleep no  no  why did you bring me away  she will be asking for me she is much better  she spoke so well today  said princess mary natasha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned princess mary s face is she like him  thought natasha  yes  like and yet not like  but she is quite original  strange  new  and unknown  and she loves me  what is in her heart  all that is good  but how  what is her mind like  what does she think about me  yes  she is splendid mary  she said timidly  drawing princess mary s hand to herself mary  you mustn t think me wicked  no  mary darling  how i love you let us be quite  quite friends and natasha  embracing her  began kissing her face and hands  making princess mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings from that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between princess mary and natasha  they were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together  when one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her  together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone  a feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them  an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other s presence sometimes they were silent for hours  sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning  they spoke most of what was long past  princess mary spoke of her childhood  of her mother  her father  and her daydreams  and natasha  who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion  submission  and the poetry of christian self sacrifice  now feeling herself bound to princess mary by affection  learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her  she did not think of applying submission and self abnegation to her own life  for she was accustomed to seek other joys  but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues  for princess mary  listening to natasha s tales of childhood and early youth  there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life  belief in life and its enjoyment just as before  they never mentioned him so as not to lower as they thought  their exalted feelings by words  but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it natasha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health  and this pleased her  but sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness  weakness and loss of good looks  and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully  surprised at its thinness  and in the morning noticed her drawn and  as it seemed to her  piteous face in her glass  it seemed to her that things must be so  and yet it was dreadfully sad one day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down  and then  testing her strength  ran upstairs again  observing the result another time when she called dunyasha her voice trembled  so she called again though she could hear dunyasha coming called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing  and listened attentively to herself she did not know and would not have believed it  but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable  delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting  which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed  the wound had begun to heal from within at the end of january princess mary left for moscow  and the count insisted on natasha s going with her to consult the doctors chapter iv after the encounter at vyazma  where kutuzov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on  the farther movement of the fleeing french  and of the russians who pursued them  continued as far as krasnoe without a battle  the flight was so rapid that the russian army pursuing the french could not keep up with them  cavalry and artillery horses broke down  and the information received of the movements of the french was never reliable the men in the russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty seven miles a day that they could not go any faster to realize the degree of exhaustion of the russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that  while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after tarutino and less than a hundred prisoners  the russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached krasnoe with only fifty thousand the rapidity of the russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the french was to theirs  the only difference was that the russian army moved voluntarily  with no such threat of destruction as hung over the french  and that the sick frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick russians left behind were among their own people  the chief cause of the wastage of napoleon s army was the rapidity of its movement  and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the russian army kutuzov as far as was in his power  instead of trying to check the movement of the french as was desired in petersburg and by the russian army generals  directed his whole activity here  as he had done at tarutino and vyazma  to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army but besides this  since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident  another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to kutuzov the aim of the russian army was to pursue the french  the road the french would take was unknown  and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover  only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the french  all the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches  whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches  to that end kutuzov s activity was directed during the whole campaign from moscow to vilna not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it kutuzov felt and knew not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his russian being what every russian soldier felt  that the french were beaten  that the enemy was flying and must be driven out  but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year but to the generals  especially the foreign ones in the russian army who wished to distinguish themselves  to astonish somebody  and for some reason to capture a king or a duke it seemed that now when any battle must be horrible and senseless was the very time to fight and conquer somebody  kutuzov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers ill shod  insufficiently clad  and half starved who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number  and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed  before they reached the frontier this longing to distinguish themselves  to maneuver  to overthrow  and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the russians stumbled on the french army so it was at krasnoe  where they expected to find one of the three french columns and stumbled instead on napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men  despite all kutuzov s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops  the massacre of the broken mob of french soldiers by worn out russians continued at krasnoe for three days toll wrote a disposition  the first column will march to so and so etc  and as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition prince eugene of wurttemberg fired from a hill over the french crowds that were running past  and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive  the french  avoiding the russians  dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night  making their way round as best they could  and continued their flight miloradovich  who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment  and could never be found when he was wanted that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  as he styled himself who was fond of parleys with the french  sent envoys demanding their surrender  wasted time  and did not do what he was ordered to do  knight without fear and without reproach i give you that column  lads  he said  riding up to the troops and pointing out the french to the cavalry and the cavalry  with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move  trotted with much effort to the column presented to them that is to say  to a crowd of frenchmen stark with cold  frost bitten and starving and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do at krasnoe they took twenty six thousand prisoners  several hundred cannon  and a stick called a marshal s staff  and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement though they much regretted not having taken napoleon  or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort  and reproached one another and especially kutuzov for having failed to do so these men  carried away by their passions  were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity  but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed they blamed kutuzov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing napoleon  that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the linen factories because he was comfortable there  that at krasnoe he checked the advance because on learning that napoleon was there he had quite lost his head  and that it was probable that he had an understanding with napoleon and had been bribed by him  and so on  and so on not only did his contemporaries  carried away by their passions  talk in this way  but posterity and history have acclaimed napoleon as grand while kutuzov is described by foreigners as a crafty  dissolute  weak old courtier  and by russians as something indefinite a sort of puppet useful only because he had a russian name chapter v in  and  kutuzov was openly accused of blundering  the emperor was dissatisfied with him  and in a history recently written by order of the highest authorities it is said that kutuzov was a cunning court liar  frightened of the name of napoleon  and that by his blunders at krasnoe and the berezina he deprived the russian army of the glory of complete victory over the french   history of the year  the character of kutuzov and reflections on the unsatisfactory results of the battles at krasnoe  by bogdanovich such is the fate not of great men grands hommes  whom the russian mind does not acknowledge  but of those rare and always solitary individuals who  discerning the will of providence  submit their personal will to it  the hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws for russian historians  strange and terrible to say  napoleon that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere  even in exile  showed human dignity napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm  he is grand  but kutuzov the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in  never once swerving by word or deed from borodino to vilna  presented an example exceptional in history of self sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening kutuzov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful  and when speaking of him and of the year  they always seem a little ashamed and yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim  and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people  still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all kutuzov s efforts were directed in kutuzov never talked of forty centuries looking down from the pyramids  of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland  or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished  in general he said nothing about himself  adopted no pose  always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men  and said the simplest and most ordinary things  he wrote letters to his daughters and to madame de stael  read novels  liked the society of pretty women  jested with generals  officers  and soldiers  and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him  when count rostopchin at the yauza bridge galloped up to kutuzov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of moscow  and said  how was it you promised not to abandon moscow without a battle  kutuzov replied  and i shall not abandon moscow without a battle  though moscow was then already abandoned  when arakcheev  coming to him from the emperor  said that ermolov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery  kutuzov replied  yes  i was just saying so myself  though a moment before he had said quite the contrary  what did it matter to him who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening what did it matter to him whether rostopchin attributed the calamities of moscow to him or to himself  still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery not merely in these cases but continually did that old man who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head but that man  so heedless of his words  did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war  obviously in spite of himself  in very diverse circumstances  he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood beginning with the battle of borodino  from which time his disagreement with those about him began  he alone said that the battle of borodino was a victory  and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death  he alone said that the loss of moscow is not the loss of russia  in reply to lauriston s proposal of peace  he said  there can be no peace  for such is the people s will  he alone during the retreat of the french said that all our maneuvers are useless  everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire  that the enemy must be offered a golden bridge  that neither the tarutino  the vyazma  nor the krasnoe battles were necessary  that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with  and that he would not sacrifice a single russian for ten frenchmen and this courtier  as he is described to us  who lies to arakcheev to please the emperor  he alone incurring thereby the emperor s displeasure said in vilna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful nor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events  his actions without the smallest deviation were all directed to one and the same threefold end   to brace all his strength for conflict with the french   to defeat them  and  to drive them out of russia  minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army this procrastinator kutuzov  whose motto was patience and time  this enemy of decisive action  gave battle at borodino  investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity  this kutuzov who before the battle of austerlitz began said that it would be lost  he alone  in contradiction to everyone else  declared till his death that borodino was a victory  despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented  he alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles  which were useless then  should not be fought and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of russia crossed it is easy now to understand the significance of these events if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals for the events and results now lie before us but how did that old man  alone  in opposition to the general opinion so truly discern the importance of the people s view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it the source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength only the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner  contrary to the tsar s wish  to select him an old man in disfavor to be their representative in the national war  and only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he  the commander in chief  devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them that simple  modest  and therefore truly great  figure could not be cast in the false mold of a european hero the supposed ruler of men that history has invented to a lackey no man can be great  for a lackey has his own conception of greatness chapter vi the fifth of november was the first day of what is called the battle of krasnoe  toward evening after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places  and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle  kutuzov left krasnoe and went to dobroe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred the day was clear and frosty  kutuzov rode to dobroe on his plump little white horse  followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back  all along the road groups of french prisoners captured that day there were seven thousand of them were crowding to warm themselves at campfires  near dobroe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners  buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of  were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed french guns  at the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on kutuzov who  wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders  moved slowly along the road on his white horse  one of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured kutuzov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying  he screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners  who presented a specially wretched appearance  most of them were disfigured by frost bitten noses and cheeks  and nearly all had red  swollen and festering eyes one group of the french stood close to the road  and two of them  one of whom had his face covered with sores  were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands  there was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which  after a glance at kutuzov  the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing kutuzov looked long and intently at these two soldiers  he puckered his face  screwed up his eyes  and pensively swayed his head  at another spot he noticed a russian soldier laughingly patting a frenchman on the shoulder  saying something to him in a friendly manner  and kutuzov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head what were you saying  he asked the general  who continuing his report directed the commander in chief s attention to some standards captured from the french and standing in front of the preobrazhensk regiment ah  the standards  said kutuzov  evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him he looked about him absently  thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him he stopped in front of the preobrazhensk regiment  sighed deeply  and closed his eyes  one of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them kutuzov was silent for a few seconds and then  submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position  raised his head and began to speak  a throng of officers surrounded him  he looked attentively around at the circle of officers  recognizing several of them i thank you all  he said  addressing the soldiers and then again the officers  in the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard  i thank you all for your hard and faithful service the victory is complete and russia will not forget you  honor to you forever he paused and looked around lower its head  lower it  he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the french eagle he was holding before the preobrazhensk standards  lower  lower  that s it  hurrah lads  he added  addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin hur r rah  roared thousands of voices while the soldiers were shouting kutuzov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head  and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam you see  brothers  said he when the shouts had ceased  and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed  it was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important there was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers  who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say you see  brothers  i know it s hard for you  but it can t be helped bear up  it won t be for long now  we ll see our visitors off and then we ll rest  the tsar won t forget your service  it is hard for you  but still you are at home while they you see what they have come to  said he  pointing to the prisoners  worse off than our poorest beggars while they were strong we didn t spare ourselves  but now we may even pity them  they are human beings too  isn t it so  lads he looked around  and in the direct  respectful  wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said  his face grew brighter and brighter with an old man s mild smile  which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles  he ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity but after all who asked them here  serves them right  the bloody bastards  he cried  suddenly lifting his head and flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign  and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting hurrah kutuzov s words were hardly understood by the troops  no one could have repeated the field marshal s address  begun solemnly and then changing into an old man s simplehearted talk  but the hearty sincerity of that speech  the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause  exactly expressed by that old man s good natured expletives  was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long sustained shouts  afterwards when one of the generals addressed kutuzov asking whether he wished his caleche to be sent for  kutuzov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob  being evidently greatly moved chapter vii when the troops reached their night s halting place on the eighth of november  the last day of the krasnoe battles  it was already growing dusk  all day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear  through the falling snow a purple black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener an infantry regiment which had left tarutino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place a village on the highroad  the quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead frenchmen  cavalrymen  and members of the staff  there was only one hut available for the regimental commander the commander rode up to his hut  the regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts like some huge many limbed animal  the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food  one part of it dispersed and waded knee deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village  and immediately the sound of axes and swords  the crashing of branches  and merry voices could be heard from there  another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit  and feeding the horses  a third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers  carrying out the french corpses that were in the huts  and dragging away boards  dry wood  and thatch from the roofs  for the campfires  or wattle fences to serve for shelter some fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed  the roof of which had already been removed now then  all together shove  cried the voices  and the huge surface of the wall  sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost  was seen swaying in the gloom of the night  the lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell  and with it the men who had been pushing it  loud  coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued now then  catch hold in twos  hand up the lever  that s it  where are you shoving to now  all together  but wait a moment  boys  with a song all stood silent  and a soft  pleasant velvety voice began to sing  at the end of the third verse as the last note died away  twenty voices roared out at once  oo oo oo oo  that s it  all together  heave away boys  but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved  and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible here  you of the sixth company  devils that you are  lend a hand will you  you may want us one of these days some twenty men of the sixth company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers  and the wattle wall  which was about thirty five feet long and seven feet high  moved forward along the village street  swaying  pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping men get along  falling  what are you stopping for  there now merry senseless words of abuse flowed freely what are you up to  suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden there are gentry here  the general himself is in that hut  and you foul mouthed devils  you brutes  i ll give it to you  shouted he hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back can t you make less noise the men became silent  the soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face  which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle there  how that devil hits out  he s made my face all bloody  said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on don t you like it  said a laughing voice  and moderating their tones the men moved forward when they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before  interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives in the hut which the men had passed  the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow  it was proposed to make a flank march to the left  cut off the vice king murat  and capture him by the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking  the wood crackled  the snow was melting  and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down axes and choppers were plied all around  everything was done without any orders being given  stores of wood were brought for the night  shelters were rigged up for the officers  caldrons were being boiled  and muskets and accouterments put in order the wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the eighth company as a shelter from the north  propped up by musket rests and a campfire was built before it  they beat the tattoo  called the roll  had supper  and settled down round the fires for the night some repairing their footgear  some smoking pipes  and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts chapter viii one would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the russian soldiers were in at that time lacking warm boots and sheepskin coats  without a roof over their heads  in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost  and without even full rations the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle on the contrary  the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect  this was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day  all the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army physically and mentally remained more men collected behind the wattle fence of the eighth company than anywhere else  two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others  for leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel eh  makeev  what has become of you  you son of a bitch  are you lost or have the wolves eaten you  fetch some more wood  shouted a red haired and red faced man  screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire  and you  jackdaw  go and fetch some wood  said he to another soldier this red haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal  but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself  the soldier they called jackdaw  a thin little fellow with a sharp nose  rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender  handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood bring it here that s fine they split up the wood  pressed it down on the fire  blew at it with their mouths  and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats  making the flames hiss and crackle  the men drew nearer and lit their pipes the handsome young soldier who had brought the wood  setting his arms akimbo  began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood mother  the dew is cold but clear  it s well that i m a musketeer  he sang  pretending to hiccough after each syllable look out  your soles will fly off  shouted the red haired man noticing that the sole of the dancer s boot was hanging loose  what a fellow you are for dancing the dancer stopped  pulled off the loose piece of leather  and threw it on the fire right enough  friend  said he  and  having sat down  took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue french cloth  and wrapped it round his foot it s the steam that spoils them  he added  stretching out his feet toward the fire they ll soon be issuing us new ones  they say that when we ve finished hammering them  we re to receive double kits and that son of a bitch petrov has lagged behind after all  it seems said one sergeant major i ve had an eye on him this long while  said the other well  he s a poor sort of soldier but in the third company they say nine men were missing yesterday yes  it s all very well  but when a man s feet are frozen how can he walk eh  don t talk nonsense  said a sergeant major do you want to be doing the same  said an old soldier  turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet well  you know  said the sharp nosed man they called jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice  raising himself at the other side of the fire  a plump man gets thin  but for a thin one it s death  take me now  i ve got no strength left  he added  with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major  tell them to send me to hospital  i m aching all over  anyway i shan t be able to keep up that ll do  that ll do  replied the sergeant major quietly the soldier said no more and the talk went on what a lot of those frenchies were taken today  and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on  said a soldier starting a new theme  they were no more than make believes the cossacks have taken their boots  they were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out  it was pitiful to see them  boys  put in the dancer  as they turned them over one seemed still alive and  would you believe it  he jabbered something in their lingo but they re a clean folk  lads  the first man went on  he was white as white as birchbark and some of them are such fine fellows  you might think they were nobles well  what do you think  they make soldiers of all classes there but they don t understand our talk at all  said the dancer with a puzzled smile  i asked him whose subject he was  and he jabbered in his own way  a queer lot but it s strange  friends  continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness  the peasants at mozhaysk were saying that when they began burying the dead where the battle was you know well  those dead had been lying there for nearly a month  and says the peasant  they lie as white as paper  clean  and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke was it from the cold  asked someone you re a clever fellow  from the cold indeed  why  it was hot  if it had been from the cold  ours would not have rotted either  but  he says  go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty  so  he says we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off  we can hardly do it  but theirs  he says  are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder all were silent it must be from their food  said the sergeant major  they used to gobble the same food as the gentry no one contradicted him that peasant near mozhaysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still didn t finish carting the dead away  and as for the wolves  he says that was a real battle  said an old soldier  it s the only one worth remembering  but since that  it s only been tormenting folk and do you know  daddy  the day before yesterday we ran at them and  my word  they didn t let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees  pardon  they say  that s only one case  they say platov took poleon himself twice  but he didn t know the right charm  he catches him and catches him no good  he turns into a bird in his hands and flies away  and there s no way of killing him either you re a first class liar  kiselev  when i come to look at you liar  indeed  it s the real truth if he fell into my hands  when i d caught him i d bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down  what a lot of men he s ruined well  anyhow we re going to end it  he won t come here again  remarked the old soldier  yawning the conversation flagged  and the soldiers began settling down to sleep look at the stars  it s wonderful how they shine  you would think the women had spread out their linen  said one of the men  gazing with admiration at the milky way that s a sign of a good harvest next year we shall want some more wood you warm your back and your belly gets frozen  that s queer o lord what are you pushing for  is the fire only for you  look how he s sprawling in the silence that ensued  the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard  others turned over and warmed themselves  now and again exchanging a few words  from a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general  merry laughter hark at them roaring there in the fifth company  said one of the soldiers  and what a lot of them there are one of the men got up and went over to the fifth company they re having such fun  said he  coming back  two frenchies have turned up  one s quite frozen and the other s an awful swaggerer  he s singing songs oh  i ll go across and have a look and several of the men went over to the fifth company chapter ix the fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest  a huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow  lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost about midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest and the crackling of dry branches a bear  lads  said one of the men they all raised their heads to listen  and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another these were two frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest  they came up to the fire  hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand  one was taller than the other  he wore an officer s hat and seemed quite exhausted  on approaching the fire he had been going to sit down  but fell  the other  a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head  was stronger  he raised his companion and said something  pointing to his mouth  the soldiers surrounded the frenchmen spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man  and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them the exhausted french officer was ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was morel  his orderly when morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers  who could not understand him  ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire  looking at the russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes  occasionally he emitted a long drawn groan and then again became silent  morel  pointing to his shoulders  tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed  a russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a french officer into his hut to warm him  and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him  ramballe was told to go  he rose and tried to walk  but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up you won t do it again  eh  said one of the soldiers  winking and turning mockingly to ramballe oh  you fool  why talk rubbish  lout that you are a real peasant came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier they surrounded ramballe  lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers  and carried him to the hut  ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively oh  you fine fellows  my kind  kind friends  these are men  oh  my brave  kind friends  and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child meanwhile morel was sitting in the best place by the fire  surrounded by the soldiers morel  a short sturdy frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes  was wearing a woman s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap  he was evidently tipsy  and was singing a french song in a hoarse broken voice  with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier the soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him now then  now then  teach us how it goes  i ll soon pick it up  how is it  said the man a singer and a wag whom morel was embracing vive henri quatre  vive ce roi valiant  sang morel  winking  ce diable a quatre   long live henry the fourth  that valiant king  that rowdy devil vivarika  vif seruvaru  sedyablyaka  repeated the soldier  flourishing his arm and really catching the tune bravo  ha  ha  ha  rose their rough  joyous laughter from all sides morel  wrinkling up his face  laughed too well  go on  go on qui eut le triple talent  de boire  de battre  et d etre un vert galant   who had a triple talent for drinking  for fighting  and for being a gallant old boy it goes smoothly  too  well  now  zaletaev ke  zaletaev  brought out with effort  ke e e e  he drawled laboriously pursing his lips  le trip ta la de bu de ba  e de tra va ga la  he sang fine  just like the frenchie  oh  ho ho  do you want some more to eat give him some porridge  it takes a long time to get filled up after starving they gave him some more porridge and morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl  all the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him the older men  who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense  continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire  but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at morel with a smile they are men too  said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat  even wormwood grows on its own root o lord  o lord  how starry it is  tremendous  that means a hard frost they all grew silent  the stars  as if knowing that no one was looking at them  began to disport themselves in the dark sky  now flaring up now vanishing  now trembling  they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another chapter x the french army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression  and that crossing of the berezina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction  and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign  if so much has been and still is written about the berezina  on the french side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory  and on the russian side merely because in petersburg far from the seat of war a plan again one of pfuel s  had been devised to catch napoleon in a strategic trap at the berezina river  everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan  and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the berezina that destroyed the french army  in reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the french in guns and men lost than krasnoe had been  as the figures show the sole importance of the crossing of the berezina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy s retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action the one kutuzov and the general mass of the army demanded namely  simply to follow the enemy up  the french crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal  it fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path  this was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges  when the bridges broke down  unarmed soldiers  people from moscow and women with children who were with the french transport  all carried on by vis inertiae pressed forward into boats and into the ice covered water and did not surrender that impulse was reasonable  the condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad  as long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them  but those who surrendered  while remaining in the same pitiful plight  would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life  the french did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners with whom the russians did not know what to do perished of cold and hunger despite their captors  desire to save them they felt that it could not be otherwise  the most compassionate russian commanders  those favorable to the french and even the frenchmen in the russian service could do nothing for the prisoners  the french perished from the conditions to which the russian army was itself exposed  it was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the french who  though not harmful  or hated  or guilty  were simply unnecessary  some russians even did that  but they were exceptions certain destruction lay behind the french but in front there was hope their ships had been burned  there was no salvation save in collective flight  and on that the whole strength of the french was concentrated the farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant  especially after the berezina  on which in consequence of the petersburg plan  special hopes had been placed by the russians  and the keener grew the passions of the russian commanders  who blamed one another and kutuzov most of all  anticipation that the failure of the petersburg berezina plan would be attributed to kutuzov led to dissatisfaction  contempt  and ridicule  more and more strongly expressed  the ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form  making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame  they did not talk seriously to him  when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality  but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn because they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man  that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans  that he would answer with his phrases which they thought were mere phrases  about a golden bridge  about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions and so forth  they had heard all that before  and all he said that it was necessary to await provisions  or that the men had no boots was so simple  while what they proposed was so complicated and clever  that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they  though not in power  were commanders of genius after the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and petersburg hero wittgenstein  this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum  kutuzov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders only once  after the affair of the berezina  did he get angry and write to bennigsen who reported separately to the emperor  the following letter on account of your spells of ill health  will your excellency please be so good as to set off for kaluga on receipt of this  and there await further commands and appointments from his imperial majesty but after bennigsen s departure  the grand duke tsarevich constantine pavlovich joined the army  he had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by kutuzov  now having come to the army  he informed kutuzov of the emperor s displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance  the emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days time the old man  experienced in court as well as in military affairs this same kutuzov who in august had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereign s wishes and who had removed the grand duke and heir apparent from the army who on his own authority and contrary to the emperor s will had decided on the abandonment of moscow  now realized at once that his day was over  that his part was played  and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his  and he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court  he saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished  and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest on the twenty ninth of november kutuzov entered vilna his dear vilna as he called it  twice during his career kutuzov had been governor of vilna  in that wealthy town  which had not been injured  he found old friends and associations  besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived  and he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and  as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed  as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all chichagov  one of the most zealous cutters off  and breakers up  who had first wanted to effect a diversion in greece and then in warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent  chichagov  noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the emperor  and who considered kutuzov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with turkey in  independently of kutuzov  and found that peace had already been concluded  he admitted to the emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really kutuzov s  this chichagov was the first to meet kutuzov at the castle where the latter was to stay  in undress naval uniform  with a dirk  and holding his cap under his arm  he handed kutuzov a garrison report and the keys of the town  the contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of chichagov  who knew of the accusations that were being directed against kutuzov when speaking to chichagov  kutuzov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at borisov had been recovered and would be restored to him you mean to imply that i have nothing to eat out of  on the contrary  i can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties  warmly replied chichagov  who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined kutuzov to be animated by the same desire kutuzov  shrugging his shoulders  replied with his subtle penetrating smile  i meant merely to say what i said contrary to the emperor s wish kutuzov detained the greater part of the army at vilna  those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town  he attended to army affairs reluctantly  left everything to his generals  and while awaiting the emperor s arrival led a dissipated life having left petersburg on the seventh of december with his suite count tolstoy  prince volkonski  arakcheev  and others the emperor reached vilna on the eleventh  and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle  in spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle  as well as a guard of honor of the semenov regiment a courier who galloped to the castle in advance  in a troyka with three foam flecked horses  shouted coming  and konovnitsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform kutuzov  who was waiting in the hall porter s little lodge a minute later the old man s large stout figure in full dress uniform his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach waddled out into the porch  he put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and  holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street  took in his hand the report he had prepared for the emperor there was running to and fro and whispering  another troyka flew furiously up  and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the emperor and volkonski could already be descried from the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general  he carefully and hastily felt himself all over readjusted his hat  and pulling himself together drew himself up and  at the very moment when the emperor  having alighted from the sleigh lifted his eyes to him  handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth  ingratiating voice the emperor with a rapid glance scanned kutuzov from head to foot frowned for an instant  but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man  extended his arms and embraced him  and this embrace too  owing to a long standing impression related to his innermost feelings  had its usual effect on kutuzov and he gave a sob the emperor greeted the officers and the semenov guard  and again pressing the old man s hand went with him into the castle when alone with the field marshal the emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at krasnoe and the berezina  and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad  kutuzov made no rejoinder or remark  the same submissive  expressionless look with which he had listened to the emperor s commands on the field of austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now when kutuzov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait  he was arrested by someone s voice saying your serene highness kutuzov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of count tolstoy  who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object  kutuzov seemed not to understand what was expected of him suddenly he seemed to remember  a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face  and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver  it was the order of st  george of the first class chapter xi next day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the emperor honored by his presence  kutuzov had received the order of st  george of the first class and the emperor showed him the highest honors  but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him  the proprieties were observed and the emperor was the first to set that example  but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good for nothing  when kutuzov  conforming to a custom of catherine s day ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the emperor s feet on his entering the ballroom  the emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words  the old comedian the emperor s displeasure with kutuzov was specially increased at vilna by the fact that kutuzov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign when on the following morning the emperor said to the officers assembled about him  you have not only saved russia  you have saved europe  they all understood that the war was not ended kutuzov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of russia but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that russia had gained  he tried to prove to the emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops  spoke of the hardships already endured by the people  of the possibility of failure and so forth this being the field marshal s frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war to avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man  the natural method was to do what had been done with him at austerlitz and with barclay at the beginning of the russian campaign to transfer the authority to the emperor himself  thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chief s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change with this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the emperor  toll  konovnitsyn  and ermolov received fresh appointments  everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal s great weakness and failing health his health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another  and in fact his health was poor so naturally  simply  and gradually just as he had come from turkey to the treasury in petersburg to recruit the militia  and then to the army when he was needed there now when his part was played out  kutuzov s place was taken by a new and necessary performer the war of  besides its national significance dear to every russian heart  was now to assume another  a european  significance the movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west  and for this fresh war another leader was necessary  having qualities and views differing from kutuzov s and animated by different motives alexander i was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as kutuzov had been for the salvation and glory of russia kutuzov did not understand what europe  the balance of power  or napoleon meant  he could not understand it  for the representative of the russian people  after the enemy had been destroyed and russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory  there was nothing left to do as a russian  nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die  and kutuzov died chapter xii as generally happens  pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over  after his liberation he reached orel  and on the third day there  when preparing to go to kiev  he fell ill and was laid up for three months  he had what the doctors termed bilious fever  but despite the fact that the doctors treated him  bled him  and gave him medicines to drink  he recovered scarcely any impression was left on pierre s mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness  he remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy  internal physical distress  and pains in his feet and side  he remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him  he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses  and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time on the day of his rescue he had seen the body of petya rostov  that same day he had learned that prince andrew  after surviving the battle of borodino for more than a month had recently died in the rostovs  house at yaroslavl  and denisov who told him this news also mentioned helene s death  supposing that pierre had heard of it long before  all this at the time seemed merely strange to pierre  he felt he could not grasp its significance  just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another  to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself  rest  and think over all the strange new facts he had learned  but on reaching orel he immediately fell ill  when he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants  terenty and vaska  who had come from moscow  and also his cousin the eldest princess  who had been living on his estate at elets and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him it was only gradually during his convalescence that pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow  that no one would deprive him of his warm bed  and that he would be sure to get his dinner  tea  and supper  but for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity  in the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue  about the death of prince andrew  the death of his wife  and the destruction of the french a joyous feeling of freedom that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside moscow filled pierre s soul during his convalescence  he was surprised to find that this inner freedom  which was independent of external conditions now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty  he was alone in a strange town  without acquaintances  no one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere  he had all he wanted  the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there since she was no more oh  how good  how splendid  said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea  or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed  or when he remembered that the french had gone and that his wife was no more  oh  how good  how splendid and by old habit he asked himself the question  well  and what then what am i going to do  and he immediately gave himself the answer well  i shall live  ah  how splendid the very question that had formerly tormented him  the thing he had continually sought to find the aim of life no longer existed for him now  that search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again  and this very absence of an aim gave him the complete  joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time he could not see an aim  for he now had faith not faith in any kind of rule  or words  or ideas  but faith in an ever living  ever manifest god  formerly he had sought him in aims he set himself  that search for an aim had been simply a search for god  and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago  that god is here and everywhere  in his captivity he had learned that in karataev god was greater  more infinite and unfathomable than in the architect of the universe recognized by the freemasons  he felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet  all his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him  when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes in the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something  he had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it  in everything near and comprehensible he had only what was limited  petty  commonplace  and senseless  he had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space  where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen  and such had european life  politics  freemasonry  philosophy  and philanthropy seemed to him  but even then  at moments of weakness as he had accounted them  his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness  worldliness  and senselessness  now  however  he had learned to see the great  eternal  and infinite in everything  and therefore to see it and enjoy its contemplation he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men s heads and gladly regarded the ever changing  eternally great  unfathomable and infinite life around him  and the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became  that dreadful question  what for  which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices  no longer existed for him to that question  what for  a simple answer was now always ready in his soul  because there is a god  that god without whose will not one hair falls from a man s head chapter xiii in external ways pierre had hardly changed at all  in appearance he was just what he used to be  as before he was absent minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own  the difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance  at present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes  but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said  though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different  formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man  and so people had been inclined to avoid him  now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips  and sympathy for others  shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was  and people felt pleased by his presence previously he had talked a great deal  grew excited when he talked  and seldom listened  now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets the princess  who had never liked pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old count s death  now after staying a short time in orel where she had come intending to show pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him  pierre did not in any way seek her approval  he merely studied her with interest  formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony  and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature  but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart  and  mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully  she let him see the hidden  kindly sides of her character the most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully  evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them  yet pierre s cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered hard  and in her own way  proud princess yes  he is a very  very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself  thought she his servants too terenty and vaska in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in pierre  they considered that he had become much simpler  terenty  when he had helped him undress and wished him good night  often lingered with his master s boots in his hands and clothes over his arm  to see whether he would not start a talk  and pierre noticing that terenty wanted a chat  generally kept him there well  tell me  now  how did you get food  he would ask and terenty would begin talking of the destruction of moscow  and of the old count  and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking  or sometimes listening to pierre s stories  and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him the doctor who attended pierre and visited him every day  though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity  would sit for hours with pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general  and especially of the ladies it s a pleasure to talk to a man like that  he is not like our provincials  he would say there were several prisoners from the french army in orel  and the doctor brought one of them  a young italian  to see pierre this officer began visiting pierre  and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the italian expressed for him the italian seemed happy only when he could come to see pierre  talk with him  tell him about his past  his life at home  and his love  and pour out to him his indignation against the french and especially against napoleon if all russians are in the least like you  it is sacrilege to fight such a nation  he said to pierre  you  who have suffered so from the french  do not even feel animosity toward them pierre had evoked the passionate affection of the italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing during the last days of pierre s stay in orel his old masonic acquaintance count willarski  who had introduced him to the lodge in  came to see him  willarski was married to a russian heiress who had a large estate in orel province  and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town hearing that bezukhov was in orel  willarski  though they had never been intimate  came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another willarski felt dull in orel and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and  as he supposed  of similar interests but to his surprise willarski soon noticed that pierre had lagged much behind the times  and had sunk  as he expressed it to himself  into apathy and egotism you are letting yourself go  my dear fellow  he said but for all that willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with pierre  and came to see him every day  to pierre as he looked at and listened to willarski  it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before willarski was a married man with a family  busy with his family affairs his wife s affairs  and his official duties  he regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life  and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family  military  administrative  political  and masonic interests continually absorbed his attention  and pierre  without trying to change the other s views and without condemning him  but with the quiet joyful  and amused smile now habitual to him  was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon there was a new feature in pierre s relations with willarski  with the princess  with the doctor  and with all the people he now met  which gained for him the general good will  this was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man s convictions by words  and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking  feeling  and seeing things each from his own point of view  this legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for  and the interest he took in  other people  the difference  and sometimes complete contradiction  between men s opinions and their lives  and between one man and another  pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile in practical matters pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked  formerly all pecuniary questions especially requests for money to which  as an extremely wealthy man  he was very exposed  produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity  to give or not to give  he had asked himself  i have it and he needs it  but someone else needs it still more  who needs it most  and perhaps they are both impostors  in the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give  formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property  when one person advised one thing and another something else now to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions  there was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done he was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters  but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done  the first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a french prisoner  a colonel came to him and  after talking a great deal about his exploits concluded by making what amounted to a demand that pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children  pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort  and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult  at the same time that he refused the colonel s demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving orel  to induce the italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need  a further proof to pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his wife s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near moscow his head steward came to him at orel and pierre reckoned up with him his diminished income  the burning of moscow had cost him  according to the head steward s calculation  about two million rubles to console pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife s debts which he was under no obligation to meet  and did not rebuild his moscow house and the country house on his moscow estate  which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing yes  of course that s true  said pierre with a cheerful smile  i don t need all that at all  by being ruined i have become much richer but in january savelich came from moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there  and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses  speaking of this as of a settled matter  about the same time he received letters from prince vasili and other petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife s debts  and pierre decided that the steward s proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to petersburg and settle his wife s affairs and must rebuild in moscow  why this was necessary he did not know  but he knew for certain that it was necessary  his income would be reduced by three fourths  but he felt it must be done willarski was going to moscow and they agreed to travel together during the whole time of his convalescence in orel pierre had experienced a feeling of joy  freedom  and life  but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces  that feeling was intensified  throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday  everyone the stagecoach driver  the post house overseers  the peasants on the roads and in the villages had a new significance for him  the presence and remarks of willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of russia and its backwardness compared with europe only heightened pierre s pleasure where willarski saw deadness pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original  peculiar  and unique people  he did not contradict willarski and even seemed to agree with him an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him chapter xiv it would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying  some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish  larvae  and corpses  others back to the heap  or why they jostle  overtake one another  and fight  and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the russians after the departure of the french to throng to the place that had formerly been moscow  but when we watch the ants round their ruined heap  the tenacity  energy  and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap  something indestructible  which though intangible is the real strength of the colony  still exists  and similarly  though in moscow in the month of october there was no government and no churches shrines  riches  or houses it was still the moscow it had been in august  all was destroyed  except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible the motives of those who thronged from all sides to moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal  and at first for the most part savage and brutal  one motive only they all had in common  a desire to get to the place that had been called moscow  to apply their activities there within a week moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants  in a fortnight twenty five thousand  and so on  by the autumn of  the number  ever increasing and increasing  exceeded what it had been in the first russians to enter moscow were the cossacks of wintzingerode s detachment  peasants from the adjacent villages  and residents who had fled from moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity  the russians who entered moscow  finding it plundered  plundered it in their turn  they continued what the french had begun  trains of peasant carts came to moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets  the cossacks carried off what they could to their camps  and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own  pretending that it was their property but the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent  and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms the french found moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life  with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship  with luxury  and governmental and religious institutions  these forms were lifeless but still existed  there were bazaars  shops  warehouses market stalls  granaries for the most part still stocked with goods and there were factories and workshops  palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries  hospitals  prisons  government offices  churches and cathedrals  the longer the french remained the more these forms of town life perished  until finally all was merged into one confused lifeless scene of plunder the more the plundering by the french continued  the more both the wealth of moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed  but plundering by the russians  with which the reoccupation of the city began  had an opposite effect  the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored besides the plunderers  very various people  some drawn by curiosity some by official duties  some by self interest house owners  clergy officials of all kinds  tradesmen  artisans  and peasants streamed into moscow as blood flows to the heart within a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town  other peasants  having heard of their comrades discomfiture  came to town bringing rye  oats  and hay  and beat down one another s prices to below what they had been in former days  gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in moscow every day  and on all sides logs were being hewn  new houses built  and old  charred ones repaired  tradesmen began trading in booths  cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses  the clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned  donors contributed church property that had been stolen  government clerks set up their baize covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms  the higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the french  the owners of houses in which much property had been left  brought there from other houses  complained of the injustice of taking everything to the faceted palace in the kremlin others insisted that as the french had gathered things from different houses into this or that house  it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there  they abused the police and bribed them made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire  and demanded relief  and count rostopchin wrote proclamations chapter xv at the end of january pierre went to moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned  he called on count rostopchin and on some acquaintances who were back in moscow  and he intended to leave for petersburg two days later  everybody was celebrating the victory everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city everyone was pleased to see pierre  everyone wished to meet him  and everyone questioned him about what he had seen  pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all  but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way  to all questions put to him whether important or quite trifling such as  where would he live  was he going to rebuild  when was he going to petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone he replied  yes  perhaps  or  i think so  and so on he had heard that the rostovs were at kostroma but the thought of natasha seldom occurred to him  if it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past  he felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which  it seemed to him  he had aroused in himself on the third day after his arrival he heard from the drubetskoys that princess mary was in moscow  the death  sufferings  and last days of prince andrew had often occupied pierre s thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness  having heard at dinner that princess mary was in moscow and living in her house which had not been burned in vozdvizhenka street  he drove that same evening to see her on his way to the house pierre kept thinking of prince andrew  of their friendship  of his various meetings with him  and especially of the last one at borodino is it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died  thought pierre  he recalled karataev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men  so different  and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them pierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood the house had escaped the fire  it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged  the old footman  who met pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments  and that she received on sundays announce me  perhaps she will see me  said pierre yes  sir  said the man  please step into the portrait gallery a few minutes later the footman returned with dessalles  who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment in a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black  pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions  but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered  this must be one of her companions  he thought  glancing at the lady in the black dress the princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand yes  she said  looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand  so this is how we meet again  he spoke of you even at the very last  she went on  turning her eyes from pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant i was so glad to hear of your safety  it was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time again the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something  but pierre interrupted her just imagine i knew nothing about him  said he  i thought he had been killed  all i know i heard at second hand from others  i only know that he fell in with the rostovs  what a strange coincidence pierre spoke rapidly and with animation  he glanced once at the companion s face  saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him  and as often happens when one is talking  felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good  kind  excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with princess mary but when he mentioned the rostovs  princess mary s face expressed still greater embarrassment  she again glanced rapidly from pierre s face to that of the lady in the black dress and said do you really not recognize her pierre looked again at the companion s pale  delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth  and something near to him  long forgotten and more than sweet  looked at him from those attentive eyes but no  it can t be  he thought  this stern  thin  pale face that looks so much older  it cannot be she  it merely reminds me of her  but at that moment princess mary said  natasha  and with difficulty effort  and stress  like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges  a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes  and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking especially at that moment  it suffused him  seized him  and enveloped him completely  when she smiled doubt was no longer possible it was natasha and he loved her at that moment pierre involuntarily betrayed to her  to princess mary and above all to himself  a secret of which he himself had been unaware he flushed joyfully yet with painful distress  he tried to hide his agitation  but the more he tried to hide it the more clearly clearer than any words could have done did he betray to himself  to her  and to princess mary that he loved her no  it s only the unexpectedness of it  thought pierre  but as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with princess mary he again glanced at natasha  and a still deeper flush suffused his face and a still stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul  he became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying pierre had failed to notice natasha because he did not at all expect to see her there  but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense  she had grown thin and pale  but that was not what made her unrecognizable  she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life  now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile  only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative pierre s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on natasha s part but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face chapter xvi she has come to stay with me  said princess mary  the count and countess will be here in a few days  the countess is in a dreadful state  but it was necessary for natasha herself to see a doctor  they insisted on her coming with me yes  is there a family free from sorrow now  said pierre  addressing natasha  you know it happened the very day we were rescued  i saw him what a delightful boy he was natasha looked at him  and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up what can one say or think of as a consolation  said pierre  nothing why had such a splendid boy  so full of life  to die yes  in these days it would be hard to live without faith  remarked princess mary yes  yes  that is really true  pierre hastily interrupted her why is it true  natasha asked  looking attentively into pierre s eyes how can you ask why  said princess mary  the thought alone of what awaits natasha without waiting for princess mary to finish again looked inquiringly at pierre and because  pierre continued  only one who believes that there is a god ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and  yours natasha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed princess mary asking about his friend s last days pierre s confusion had now almost vanished  but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone  he felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world  as he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on natasha  he did not purposely say things to please her  but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint princess mary reluctantly as is usual in such cases began telling of the condition in which she had found prince andrew  but pierre s face quivering with emotion  his questions and his eager restless expression gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake yes  yes  and so  pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story  yes  yes  so he grew tranquil and softened  with all his soul he had always sought one thing to be perfectly good so he could not be afraid of death  the faults he had if he had any were not of his making  so he did soften  what a happy thing that he saw you again  he added  suddenly turning to natasha and looking at her with eyes full of tears natasha s face twitched  she frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment she hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not yes  that was happiness  she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes  for me it certainly was happiness  she paused  and he  he  he said he was wishing for it at the very moment i entered the room natasha s voice broke  she blushed  pressed her clasped hands on her knees  and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly we knew nothing of it when we started from moscow  i did not dare to ask about him  then suddenly sonya told me he was traveling with us  i had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in  all i wanted was to see him and be with him  she said  trembling  and breathing quickly and not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at yaroslavl pierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears  as he listened he did not think of prince andrew  nor of death nor of what she was telling  he listened to her and felt only pity for her  for what she was suffering now while she was speaking princess mary  frowning in her effort to hold back her tears  sat beside natasha  and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother s and natasha s love evidently natasha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale she spoke  mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul  and it seemed as if she could never finish  several times she repeated the same thing twice dessalles  voice was heard outside the door asking whether little nicholas might come in to say good night well  that s all everything  said natasha she got up quickly just as nicholas entered  almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains  struck her head against it  and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow pierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world princess mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room at that moment of emotional tenderness young nicholas  face  which resembled his father s  affected pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly  took out his handkerchief  and went to the window  he wished to take leave of princess mary  but she would not let him go no  natasha and i sometimes don t go to sleep till after two  so please don t go  i will order supper  go downstairs  we will come immediately before pierre left the room princess mary told him  this is the first time she has talked of him like that chapter xvii pierre was shown into the large  brightly lit dining room  a few minutes later he heard footsteps and princess mary entered with natasha  natasha was calm  though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face  they all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk  it is impossible to go back to the same conversation  to talk of trifles is awkward  and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation  they went silently to table  the footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again  pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and  resolving to break the silence  looked at natasha and at princess mary  they had evidently both formed the same resolution  the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy do you take vodka  count  asked princess mary  and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past  now tell us about yourself said she  one hears such improbable wonders about you yes  replied pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him they even tell me wonders i myself never dreamed of  mary abramovna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened  or ought to have happened  to me  stepan stepanych also instructed me how i ought to tell of my experiences  in general i have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man i am an interesting man now  people invite me out and tell me all about myself natasha smiled and was on the point of speaking we have been told  princess mary interrupted her  that you lost two millions in moscow  is that true but i am three times as rich as before  returned pierre though the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife s debts and to rebuild his houses  pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before what i have certainly gained is freedom  he began seriously  but did not continue  noticing that this theme was too egotistic and are you building yes  savelich says i must tell me  you did not know of the countess  death when you decided to remain in moscow  asked princess mary and immediately blushed  noticing that her question  following his mention of freedom  ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended no  answered pierre  evidently not considering awkward the meaning princess mary had given to his words  i heard of it in orel and you cannot imagine how it shocked me  we were not an exemplary couple  he added quickly  glancing at natasha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife  but her death shocked me terribly when two people quarrel they are always both in fault  and one s own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive  and then such a death  without friends and without consolation i am very  very sorry for her  he concluded  and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on natasha s face yes  and so you are once more an eligible bachelor  said princess mary pierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at natasha  when he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold stern  and he fancied even contemptuous and did you really see and speak to napoleon  as we have been told said princess mary pierre laughed no  not once  everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being napoleon s guest  not only did i never see him but i heard nothing about him i was in much lower company supper was over  and pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so but it s true that you remained in moscow to kill napoleon  natasha asked with a slight smile  i guessed it then when we met at the sukharev tower  do you remember pierre admitted that it was true  and from that was gradually led by princess mary s questions and especially by natasha s into giving a detailed account of his adventures at first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself  but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through princess mary with a gentle smile looked now at pierre and now at natasha  in the whole narrative she saw only pierre and his goodness natasha  leaning on her elbow  the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative  watched pierre with an attention that never wandered evidently herself experiencing all that he described  not only her look  but her exclamations and the brief questions she put  showed pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey  it was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to but could not  express in words  the account pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this  it was an awful sight children abandoned  some in the flames one was snatched out before my eyes  and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out  he flushed and grew confused  then a patrol arrived and all the men all those who were not looting  that is were arrested  and i among them i am sure you re not telling us everything  i am sure you did something  said natasha and pausing added  something fine pierre continued  when he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details  but natasha insisted that he should not omit anything pierre began to tell about karataev  but paused  by this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room  natasha following him with her eyes  then he added no  you can t understand what i learned from that illiterate man that simple fellow yes  yes  go on  said natasha  where is he they killed him almost before my eyes and pierre  his voice trembling continually  went on to tell of the last days of their retreat  of karataev s illness and his death he told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them  he now  as it were  saw a new meaning in all he had gone through  now that he was telling it all to natasha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it  or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself natasha without knowing it was all attention  she did not lose a word no single quiver in pierre s voice  no look  no twitch of a muscle in his face  nor a single gesture  she caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart  divining the secret meaning of all pierre s mental travail princess mary understood his story and sympathized with him  but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention  she saw the possibility of love and happiness between natasha and pierre  and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness it was three o clock in the morning  the footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles  but no one noticed them pierre finished his story  natasha continued to look at him intently with bright  attentive  and animated eyes  as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold  pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her  and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject  princess mary was silent  it occurred to none of them that it was three o clock and time to go to bed people speak of misfortunes and sufferings  remarked pierre  but if at this moment i were asked  would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner  or go through all this again  then for heaven s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh  we imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost  but it is only then that what is new and good begins  while there is life there is happiness  there is much  much before us  i say this to you  he added turning to natasha yes  yes  she said  answering something quite different  i too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning pierre looked intently at her yes  and nothing more  said natasha it s not true  not true  cried pierre  i am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live nor you either suddenly natasha bent her head  covered her face with her hands  and began to cry what is it  natasha  said princess mary nothing  nothing  she smiled at pierre through her tears  good night it is time for bed pierre rose and took his leave princess mary and natasha met as usual in the bedroom  they talked of what pierre had told them  princess mary did not express her opinion of pierre nor did natasha speak of him well  good night  mary  said natasha  do you know  i am often afraid that by not speaking of him  she meant prince andrew  for fear of not doing justice to our feelings  we forget him princess mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of natasha s remark  but she did not express agreement in words is it possible to forget  said she it did me so much good to tell all about it today  it was hard and painful  but good  very good  said natasha  i am sure he really loved him  that is why i told him  was it all right  she added  suddenly blushing to tell pierre  oh  yes  what a splendid man he is  said princess mary do you know  mary  natasha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as princess mary had not seen on her face for a long time  he has somehow grown so clean  smooth  and fresh as if he had just come out of a russian bath  do you understand  out of a moral bath  isn t it true yes  replied princess mary  he has greatly improved with a short coat and his hair cropped  just as if  well  just as if he had come straight from the bath  papa used to i understand why he  prince andrew  liked no one so much as him said princess mary yes  and yet he is quite different  they say men are friends when they are quite different  that must be true  really he is quite unlike him in everything yes  but he s wonderful well  good night  said natasha and the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there chapter xviii it was a long time before pierre could fall asleep that night  he paced up and down his room  now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning  now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing  and now smiling happily he was thinking of prince andrew  of natasha  and of their love  at one moment jealous of her past  then reproaching himself for that feeling it was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room well  what s to be done if it cannot be avoided  what s to be done evidently it has to be so  said he to himself  and hastily undressing he got into bed  happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision strange and impossible as such happiness seems  i must do everything that she and i may be man and wife  he told himself a few days previously pierre had decided to go to petersburg on the friday  when he awoke on the thursday  savelich came to ask him about packing for the journey what  to petersburg  what is petersburg  who is there in petersburg he asked involuntarily  though only to himself  oh  yes  long ago before this happened i did for some reason mean to go to petersburg  he reflected  why  but perhaps i shall go  what a good fellow he is and how attentive  and how he remembers everything  he thought  looking at savelich s old face  and what a pleasant smile he has well  savelich  do you still not wish to accept your freedom  pierre asked him what s the good of freedom to me  your excellency  we lived under the late count the kingdom of heaven be his and we have lived under you too  without ever being wronged and your children the children will live just the same  with such masters one can live but what about my heirs  said pierre  supposing i suddenly marry it might happen  he added with an involuntary smile if i may take the liberty  your excellency  it would be a good thing how easy he thinks it  thought pierre  he doesn t know how terrible it is and how dangerous  too soon or too late  it is terrible so what are your orders  are you starting tomorrow  asked savelich no  i ll put it off for a bit  i ll tell you later  you must forgive the trouble i have put you to  said pierre  and seeing savelich smile he thought  but how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no petersburg for me  and that that must be settled first of all  but probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending  shall i have a talk with him and see what he thinks  pierre reflected  no another time at breakfast pierre told the princess  his cousin  that he had been to see princess mary the day before and had there met whom do you think natasha rostova the princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen anna semenovna do you know her  asked pierre i have seen the princess  she replied  i heard that they were arranging a match for her with young rostov  it would be a very good thing for the rostovs  they are said to be utterly ruined no  i mean do you know natasha rostova i heard about that affair of hers at the time  it was a great pity no  she either doesn t understand or is pretending  thought pierre better not say anything to her either the princess too had prepared provisions for pierre s journey how kind they all are  thought pierre  what is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them  and all for me on the same day the chief of police came to pierre  inviting him to send a representative to the faceted palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day and this man too  thought pierre  looking into the face of the chief of police  what a fine  good looking officer and how kind  fancy bothering about such trifles now  and they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes  what nonsense  besides  why shouldn t he take bribes that s the way he was brought up  and everybody does it  but what a kind  pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me pierre went to princess mary s to dinner as he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down  he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins  the picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble down walls of the burned out quarters of the town  stretching out and concealing one another  reminded him of the rhine and the colosseum  the cabmen he met and their passengers  the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes  the women hawkers  and the shopkeepers  all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say  ah  there he is  let s see what will come of it at the entrance to princess mary s house pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen natasha and talked to her  perhaps i imagined it  perhaps i shall go in and find no one there  but he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom  she was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before  yet she was quite different  had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her she was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as prince andrew s fiancee  a bright questioning light shone in her eyes  and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression pierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there  but princess mary was going to vespers and pierre left the house with her next day he came early  dined  and stayed the whole evening  though princess mary and natasha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all pierre s interest was now centered in that house  by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off  he stayed so long that princess mary and natasha exchanged glances  evidently wondering when he would go  pierre noticed this but could not go  he felt uneasy and embarrassed  but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave princess mary  foreseeing no end to this  rose first  and complaining of a headache began to say good night so you are going to petersburg tomorrow  she asked no  i am not going  pierre replied hastily  in a surprised tone and as though offended  yes  no  to petersburg  tomorrow but i won t say good by yet  i will call round in case you have any commissions for me said he  standing before princess mary and turning red  but not taking his departure natasha gave him her hand and went out  princess mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair  and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep  radiant eyes  the weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off  with a deep and long drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk when natasha left the room pierre s confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement  he quickly moved an armchair toward princess mary yes  i wanted to tell you  said he  answering her look as if she had spoken  princess  help me  what am i to do  can i hope  princess  my dear friend  listen  i know it all  i know i am not worthy of her  i know it s impossible to speak of it now  but i want to be a brother to her  no  not that  i don t  i can t he paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands well  he went on with an evident effort at self control and coherence i don t know when i began to love her  but i have loved her and her alone all my life  and i love her so that i cannot imagine life without her  i cannot propose to her at present  but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that i may be missing that possibility  that possibility  is terrible  tell me  can i hope tell me what i am to do  dear princess  he added after a pause  and touched her hand as she did not reply i am thinking of what you have told me  answered princess mary  this is what i will say  you are right that to speak to her of love at present princess mary stopped  she was going to say that to speak of love was impossible  but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in natasha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if pierre spoke of his love  but that it was the very thing she wished for to speak to her now wouldn t do  said the princess all the same but what am i to do leave it to me  said princess mary  i know pierre was looking into princess mary s eyes well  well  he said i know that she loves  will love you  princess mary corrected herself before her words were out  pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized princess mary s hand what makes you think so  you think i may hope  you think yes  i think so  said princess mary with a smile  write to her parents  and leave it to me  i will tell her when i can  i wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will no  it cannot be  how happy i am  but it can t be  how happy i am no  it can t be  pierre kept saying as he kissed princess mary s hands go to petersburg  that will be best  and i will write to you  she said to petersburg  go there  very well  i ll go  but i may come again tomorrow next day pierre came to say good by  natasha was less animated than she had been the day before  but that day as he looked at her pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer  that nothing existed but happiness  is it possible no  it can t be  he told himself at every look  gesture  and word that filled his soul with joy when on saying good by he took her thin  slender hand  he could not help holding it a little longer in his own is it possible that this hand  that face  those eyes  all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now  is it possible that it will one day be mine forever  as familiar to me as i am to myself  no  that s impossible good bye  count  she said aloud  i shall look forward very much to your return  she added in a whisper and these simple words  her look  and the expression on her face which accompanied them  formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories  interpretations  and happy meditations for pierre  i shall look forward very much to your return  yes  yes  how did she say it yes  i shall look forward very much to your return  oh  how happy i am  what is happening to me  how happy i am  said pierre to himself chapter xix there was nothing in pierre s soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of helene he did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken  or say  oh  why did i not say that  and  whatever made me say je vous aime  on the contrary  he now repeated in imagination every word that he or natasha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile  and did not wish to diminish or add anything  but only to repeat it again and again  there was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind  wasn t it all a dream  isn t princess mary mistaken  am i not too conceited and self confident  i believe all this and suddenly princess mary will tell her and she will be sure to smile and say  how strange  he must be deluding himself  doesn t he know that he is a man  just a man  while i  i am something altogether different and higher that was the only doubt often troubling pierre  he did not now make any plans  the happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it  it would be the end of all things  everything ended with that a joyful  unexpected frenzy  of which he had thought himself incapable possessed him  the whole meaning of life not for him alone but for the whole world seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her  at times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only his future happiness  sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests  in every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness  he often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them  and when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness  he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention when it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service  or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybody s welfare depended on this or that issue of events  he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments  but at this time he saw everybody both those who  as he imagined  understood the real meaning of life that is what he was feeling  and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself  and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved when dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife  her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew  prince vasili  who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time  seemed to him a pathetic  kindly old man much to be pitied often in afterlife pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity  all the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always  he not only did not renounce them subsequently  but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance  he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct i may have appeared strange and queer then  he thought  but i was not so mad as i seemed  on the contrary i was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time  and understood all that is worth understanding in life  because  because i was happy pierre s insanity consisted in not waiting  as he used to do  to discover personal attributes which he termed good qualities  in people before loving them  his heart was now overflowing with love  and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them chapter xx after pierre s departure that first evening  when natasha had said to princess mary with a gaily mocking smile  he looks just  yes  just as if he had come out of a russian bath in a short coat and with his hair cropped  something hidden and unknown to herself  but irrepressible awoke in natasha s soul everything  her face  walk  look  and voice  was suddenly altered  to her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction  from that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her  she no longer complained of her position  did not say a word about the past  and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future  she spoke little of pierre  but when princess mary mentioned him a long extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile the change that took place in natasha at first surprised princess mary but when she understood its meaning it grieved her  can she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon  she thought when she reflected on the change  but when she was with natasha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her  the reawakened power of life that had seized natasha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence princess mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart natasha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad  but bright and cheerful when princess mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with pierre  natasha met her on the threshold he has spoken  yes  he has spoken  she repeated and a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on natasha s face i wanted to listen at the door  but i knew you would tell me understandable and touching as the look with which natasha gazed at her seemed to princess mary  and sorry as she was to see her agitation these words pained her for a moment  she remembered her brother and his love but what s to be done  she can t help it  thought the princess and with a sad and rather stern look she told natasha all that pierre had said  on hearing that he was going to petersburg natasha was astounded to petersburg  she repeated as if unable to understand but noticing the grieved expression on princess mary s face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry mary  said she  tell me what i should do  i am afraid of being bad whatever you tell me  i will do  tell me you love him yes  whispered natasha then why are you crying  i am happy for your sake  said princess mary who because of those tears quite forgave natasha s joy it won t be just yet someday  think what fun it will be when i am his wife and you marry nicholas natasha  i have asked you not to speak of that  let us talk about you they were silent awhile but why go to petersburg  natasha suddenly asked  and hastily replied to her own question  but no  no  he must  yes  mary  he must first epilogue    chapter i seven years had passed  the storm tossed sea of european history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm  but the mysterious forces that move humanity mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us  continued to operate though the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless  the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time  various groups of people formed and dissolved  the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation the sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously  it was seething in its depths  historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before  they now seemed to rotate on one spot  the historical figures at the head of armies  who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars campaigns  and battles  now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations  laws  and treaties the historians call this activity of the historical figures the reaction in dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who  in their opinion  caused what they describe as the reaction  all the well known people of that period  from alexander and napoleon to madame de stael  photius  schelling  fichte  chateaubriand and the rest  pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction according to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in russia also  and the chief culprit was alexander i  the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign  being the savior of russia there is no one in russian literature now  from schoolboy essayist to learned historian  who does not throw his little stone at alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign he ought to have acted in this way and in that way  in this case he did well and in that case badly  he behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during  but acted badly by giving a constitution to poland  forming the holy alliance  entrusting power to arakcheev favoring golitsyn and mysticism  and afterwards shishkov and photius  he also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the semenov regiment it would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him  based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity what do these reproaches mean do not the very actions for which the historians praise alexander i the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign  his struggle with napoleon  the firmness he displayed in  and the campaign of flow from the same sources the circumstances of his birth  education and life that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him the holy alliance  the restoration of poland  and the reaction of  and later  also flowed in what does the substance of those reproaches lie it lies in the fact that an historic character like alexander i standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him  a character exposed to those strongest of all influences  the intrigues  flattery  and self deception inseparable from power  a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in europe  and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits  passions  and impulses toward goodness  beauty  and truth that this character though not lacking in virtue the historians do not accuse him of that had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning  that is  with books and lectures and with taking notes from them but even if we assume that fifty years ago alexander i was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people  we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity this assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because  watching the movement of history  we see that every year and with each new writer  opinion as to what is good for mankind changes  so that what once seemed good  ten years later seems bad  and vice versa  and what is more  we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history  some people regard giving a constitution to poland and forming the holy alliance as praiseworthy in alexander  while others regard it as blameworthy the activity of alexander or of napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful  for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful if that activity displeases somebody  this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good  whether the preservation of my father s house in moscow  or the glory of the russian arms  or the prosperity of the petersburg and other universities  or the freedom of poland or the greatness of russia  or the balance of power in europe  or a certain kind of european culture called progress  appear to me to be good or bad  i must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me but let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events  let us say that alexander could have done everything differently  let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity  he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him of nationality freedom  equality  and progress these  i think  cover the ground  let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated and that alexander had acted on it  what would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent  their activity would not have existed  there would have been no life  there would have been nothing if we admit that human life can be ruled by reason  the possibility of life is destroyed chapter ii if we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends the greatness of russia or of france  the balance of power in europe  the diffusion of the ideas of the revolution  general progress  or anything else then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius if the aim of the european wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of russia  that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion  if the aim was the aggrandizement of france  that might have been attained without the revolution and without the empire  if the aim was the dissemination of ideas  the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare  if the aim was the progress of civilization it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives why did it happen in this and not in some other way because it happened so  chance created the situation  genius utilized it  says history but what is chance  what is genius the words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined  those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena  i do not know why a certain event occurs  i think that i cannot know it  so i do not try to know it and i talk about chance  i see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies  i do not understand why this occurs and i talk of genius to a herd of rams  the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius  and it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats that this very ram  swelling with fat  is killed for meat but the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims  they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened  even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened  they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally  and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius only by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us  and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken  may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities  and then the words chance and genius become superfluous we need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the european convulsions and that we know only the facts that is  the murders  first in france  then in italy  in africa  in prussia  in austria  in spain and in russia and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events  and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in napoleon and alexander  but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men  and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were  but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable by discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose  we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces  so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill  than napoleon and alexander with all their antecedents chapter iii the fundamental and essential significance of the european events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the european peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west the commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east for the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to moscow it was necessary   that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east   that they should abandon all established traditions and customs  and  that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions  robberies  and murders which would have to be committed during that movement and beginning with the french revolution the old inadequately large group was destroyed  as well as the old habits and traditions  and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions  and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done a man without convictions  without habits  without traditions  without a name  and not even a frenchman  emerges by what seem the strangest chances from among all the seething french parties  and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position the ignorance of his colleagues  the weakness and insignificance of his opponents  the frankness of his falsehoods  and the dazzling and self confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army  the brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to italy  his opponents  reluctance to fight  and his own childish audacity and self confidence secure him military fame  innumerable so called chances accompany him everywhere  the disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of france turns to his advantage  his attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful  he is not received into the russian service  and the appointment he seeks in turkey comes to nothing  during the war in italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner  owing to various diplomatic considerations the russian armies just those which might have destroyed his prestige do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there on his return from italy he finds the government in paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed  and by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to africa  again so called chance accompanies him  impregnable malta surrenders without a shot  his most reckless schemes are crowned with success  the enemy s fleet  which subsequently did not let a single boat pass  allows his entire army to elude it  in africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants  and the men who commit these crimes  especially their leader  assure themselves that this is admirable  this is glory it resembles caesar and alexander the great and is therefore good this ideal of glory and grandeur which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits  ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance that ideal  destined to guide this man and his associates had scope for its development in africa  whatever he does succeeds  the plague does not touch him  the cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault  his childishly rash  uncalled for  and ignoble departure from africa  leaving his comrades in distress  is set down to his credit  and again the enemy s fleet twice lets him slip past  when  intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully he reaches paris  the dissolution of the republican government  which a year earlier might have ruined him  has reached its extreme limit  and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him and though he himself has no plan  he is quite ready for his new role he had no plan  he was afraid of everything  but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation he alone with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in italy and egypt  his insane self adulation  his boldness in crime and frankness in lying he alone could justify what had to be done he is needed for the place that awaits him  and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision  his lack of a plan  and all his mistakes  he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success he is pushed into a meeting of the legislature  in alarm he wishes to flee  considering himself lost  he pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him  but the once proud and shrewd rulers of france  feeling that their part is played out  are even more bewildered than he  and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power chance  millions of chances  give him power  and all men as if by agreement co operate to confirm that power  chance forms the characters of the rulers of france  who submit to him  chance forms the character of paul i of russia who recognizes his government  chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power  chance puts the duc d enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right  since he had the might  chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against england which would inevitably have ruined him  he never carries out that intention  but unexpectedly falls upon mack and the austrians  who surrender without a battle  chance and genius give him the victory at austerlitz  and by chance all men  not only the french but all europe except england which does not take part in the events about to happen despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes  now recognize his authority  the title he has given himself and his ideal of grandeur and glory  which seems excellent and reasonable to them all as if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement  the western forces push toward the east several times in   and  gaining strength and growing  in  the group of people that had formed in france unites into one group with the peoples of central europe  the strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group  during the ten year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of europe  the discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur  one after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him  the king of prussia sends his wife to seek the great man s mercy  the emperor of austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the caesars into his bed  the pope  the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred  utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man  it is not napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role  so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen  there is no step  no crime or petty fraud he commits  which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed  the most suitable fete the germans can devise for him is a celebration of jena and auerstadt  not only is he great  but so are his ancestors  his brothers  his stepsons  and his brothers in law  everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part  and when he is ready so too are the forces the invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal moscow  that city is taken  the russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from austerlitz to wagram  but suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal  an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur from the cold in his head at borodino to the sparks which set moscow on fire and the frosts and instead of genius  stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident the invaders flee  turn back  flee again  and all the chances are now not for napoleon but always against him a countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east attempted drives from east to west similar to the contrary movements of   and precede the great westward movement  there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions  the same adhesion of the people of central europe to the movement  the same hesitation midway  and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached paris  the ultimate goal  is reached  the napoleonic government and army are destroyed  napoleon himself is no longer of any account  all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean  but again an inexplicable chance occurs  the allies detest napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings  deprived of power and authority  his crimes and his craft exposed  he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later an outlawed brigand  but by some strange chance no one perceives this  his part is not yet ended  the man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days  sail from france  which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion  and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him chapter iv the flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels  the waves of the great movement abate  and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists  who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate but the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed  the diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces  they anticipate war between their sovereigns  the position seems to them insoluble  but the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect  it rises again from the same point as before paris  the last backwash of the movement from the west occurs  a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history the man who had devastated france returns to france alone  without any conspiracy and without soldiers  any guard might arrest him  but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later this man is still needed to justify the final collective act that act is performed the last role is played  the actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint  he will not be wanted any more and some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island  justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed  and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions the manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us see what you believed in  this is he  do you now see that it was not he but i who moved you but dazed by the force of the movement  it was long before people understood this still greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of alexander i  the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west what was needed for him who  overshadowing others  stood at the head of that movement from east to west what was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with european affairs  but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests  a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co operated with him  a mild and attractive personality  and a personal grievance against napoleon  and all this was found in alexander i  all this had been prepared by innumerable so called chances in his life  his education his early liberalism  the advisers who surrounded him  and by austerlitz  and tilsit  and erfurt during the national war he was inactive because he was not needed  but as soon as the necessity for a general european war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and  uniting the nations of europe  led them to the goal the goal is reached  after the final war of  alexander possesses all possible power  how does he use it alexander i the pacifier of europe  the man who from his early years had striven only for his people s welfare  the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples at the time when napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power alexander i  having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of god upon him  suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power  turns away from it  and gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises  saying only not unto us  not unto us  but unto thy name  i too am a man like the rest of you  let me live like a man and think of my soul and of god as the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself  and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend  so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man a bee settling on a flower has stung a child  and the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people  a poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers  a beekeeper  seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive  says that it exists to gather honey another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen  and that it exists to perpetuate its race  a botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter  and sees in this the purpose of the bee s existence  another  observing the migration of plants  notices that the bee helps in this work  and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee  but the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first the second  or any of the processes the human mind can discern  the higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes  the more obvious it becomes  that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension all that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life  and so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations chapter v natasha s wedding to bezukhov  which took place in  was the last happy event in the family of the old rostovs  count ilya rostov died that same year and  as always happens  after the father s death the family group broke up the events of the previous year  the burning of moscow and the flight from it  the death of prince andrew  natasha s despair  petya s death and the old countess  grief fell blow after blow on the old count s head  he seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events  and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him  he seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising the arrangements for natasha s marriage occupied him for a while  he ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful  but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be  on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him when pierre and his wife had left  he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression  a few days later he fell ill and took to his bed  he realized from the first that he would not get up again  despite the doctor s encouragement  the countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing  every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand  on his last day sobbing  he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property that being the chief fault of which he was conscious  after receiving communion and unction he quietly died  and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the rostovs  all these acquaintances  who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him  now said  with a common feeling of self reproach and emotion  as if justifying themselves  well  whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man  you don t meet such men nowadays  and which of us has not weaknesses of his own it was just when the count s affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died nicholas was with the russian army in paris when the news of his father s death reached him  he at once resigned his commission  and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to moscow  the state of the count s affairs became quite obvious a month after his death  surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected  the debts amounted to double the value of the property friends and relations advised nicholas to decline the inheritance  but he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father s memory  which he held sacred  and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts the creditors who had so long been silent  restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count s careless good nature  all proceeded to enforce their claims at once  as always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first  and those who like mitenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors  nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace  and those who had seemed to pity the old man the cause of their losses if they were losses now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them not one of the plans nicholas tried succeeded  the estate was sold by auction for half its value  and half the debts still remained unpaid nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother in law bezukhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received  and to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder  as the creditors threatened  he re entered the government service he could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy  for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life  and so despite his reluctance to remain in moscow among people who had known him before  and despite his abhorrence of the civil service he accepted a post in moscow in that service  doffed the uniform of which he was so fond  and moved with his mother and sonya to a small house on the sivtsev vrazhek natasha and pierre were living in petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of nicholas  circumstances  having borrowed money from his brother in law  nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him his position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself  his mother  and sonya but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty  the countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and  unable to realize how hard it was for her son  kept demanding now a carriage which they did not keep  to send for a friend  now some expensive article of food for herself  or wine for her son  or money to buy a present as a surprise for natasha or sonya  or for nicholas himself sonya kept house  attended on her aunt  read to her  put up with her whims and secret ill will  and helped nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess  nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to sonya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion  but tried to keep aloof from her he seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect  and because there was nothing to reproach her with  she had all that people are valued for  but little that could have made him love her  he felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her  he had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed nicholas  position became worse and worse  the idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream  not only did he not save anything  but to comply with his mother s demands he even incurred some small debts  he could see no way out of this situation  the idea of marrying some rich woman  which was suggested to him by his female relations  was repugnant to him  the other way out his mother s death never entered his head  he wished for nothing and hoped for nothing  and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position  he tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance  he avoided all distraction and recreation  and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother  pace silently up and down the room  and smoke one pipe after another  he seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position chapter vi at the beginning of winter princess mary came to moscow  from reports current in town she learned how the rostovs were situated  and how the son has sacrificed himself for his mother  as people were saying i never expected anything else of him  said princess mary to herself feeling a joyous sense of her love for him  remembering her friendly relations with all the rostovs which had made her almost a member of the family  she thought it her duty to go to see them  but remembering her relations with nicholas in voronezh she was shy about doing so  making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in moscow nicholas was the first to meet her  as the countess  room could only be reached through his  but instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected  at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold  stiff proud expression she had not seen on it before  he inquired about her health  led the way to his mother  and having sat there for five minutes left the room when the princess came out of the countess  room nicholas met her again and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom to her remarks about his mother s health he made no reply  what s that to you  leave me in peace  his looks seemed to say why does she come prowling here  what does she want  i can t bear these ladies and all these civilities  said he aloud in sonya s presence evidently unable to repress his vexation  after the princess  carriage had disappeared oh  nicholas  how can you talk like that  cried sonya  hardly able to conceal her delight  she is so kind and mamma is so fond of her nicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more  but after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day she sang her praises  insisted that her son must call on her  expressed a wish to see her often  but yet always became ill humored when she began to talk about her nicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess but his silence irritated her she is a very admirable and excellent young woman  said she  and you must go and call on her  you would at least be seeing somebody  and i think it must be dull for you only seeing us but i don t in the least want to  mamma you used to want to  and now you don t  really i don t understand you my dear  one day you are dull  and the next you refuse to see anyone but i never said i was dull why  you said yourself you don t want even to see her  she is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her  but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head  you hide everything from me not at all  mamma if i were asking you to do something disagreeable now but i only ask you to return a call  one would think mere politeness required it well  i have asked you  and now i won t interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother well  then  i ll go if you wish it it doesn t matter to me  i only wish it for your sake nicholas sighed  bit his mustache  and laid out the cards for a patience  trying to divert his mother s attention to another topic the same conversation was repeated next day and the day after  and the day after that after her visit to the rostovs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by nicholas  princess mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call i expected nothing else  she told herself  calling her pride to her aid  i have nothing to do with him and i only wanted to see the old lady  who was always kind to me and to whom i am under many obligations but she could not pacify herself with these reflections  a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit  though she had firmly resolved not to call on the rostovs again and to forget the whole matter  she felt herself all the time in an awkward position  and when she asked herself what distressed her  she had to admit that it was her relation to rostov  his cold  polite manner did not express his feeling for her she knew that  but it concealed something  and until she could discover what that something was  she felt that she could not be at ease one day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her nephew s lessons  she was informed that rostov had called  with a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation  she sent for mademoiselle bourienne and went with her to the drawing room her first glance at nicholas  face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness  and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her they spoke of the countess  health  of their mutual friends  of the latest war news  and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise  nicholas got up to say good by with mademoiselle bourienne s help the princess had maintained the conversation very well  but at the very last moment  just when he rose she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her  and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life  that in a fit of absent mindedness she sat still  her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her  not noticing that he had risen nicholas glanced at her and  wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction  made some remark to mademoiselle bourienne and then again looked at the princess  she still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face  he suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed  he wished to help her and say something pleasant  but could think of nothing to say good bye  princess  said he she started  flushed  and sighed deeply oh  i beg your pardon  she said as if waking up  are you going already  count  well then  good by  oh  but the cushion for the countess wait a moment  i ll fetch it  said mademoiselle bourienne  and she left the room they both sat silent  with an occasional glance at one another yes  princess  said nicholas at last with a sad smile  it doesn t seem long ago since we first met at bogucharovo  but how much water has flowed since then  in what distress we all seemed to be then  yet i would give much to bring back that time  but there s no bringing it back princess mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this  she seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her yes  yes  said she  but you have no reason to regret the past  count as i understand your present life  i think you will always recall it with satisfaction  because the self sacrifice that fills it now i cannot accept your praise  he interrupted her hurriedly  on the contrary i continually reproach myself  but this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject his face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression  but the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved  and it was to him that she now spoke i thought you would allow me to tell you this  she said  i had come so near to you  and to all your family that i thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced  but i was mistaken  and suddenly her voice trembled  i don t know why  she continued  recovering herself but you used to be different  and there are a thousand reasons why  laying special emphasis on the why thank you  princess  he added softly  sometimes it is hard so that s why  that s why  a voice whispered in princess mary s soul no  it was not only that gay  kind  and frank look  not only that handsome exterior  that i loved in him  i divined his noble  resolute self sacrificing spirit too  she said to herself  yes  he is poor now and i am rich  yes  that s the only reason  yes  were it not for that  and remembering his former tenderness  and looking now at his kind  sorrowful face  she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness but why  count  why  she almost cried  unconsciously moving closer to him  why  tell me  you must tell me he was silent i don t understand your why  count  she continued  but it s hard for me  i confess it  for some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship  and that hurts me  there were tears in her eyes and in her voice  i have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear  excuse me  good by  and suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room princess  for god s sake  he exclaimed  trying to stop her princess she turned round  for a few seconds they gazed silently into one another s eyes and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became possible  inevitable  and very near chapter vii in the winter of  nicholas married princess mary and moved to bald hills with his wife  his mother  and sonya within four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife s property  and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to pierre as well in another three years  by  he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining bald hills and was negotiating to buy back otradnoe that being his pet dream having started farming from necessity  he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation  nicholas was a plain farmer  he did not like innovations  especially the english ones then coming into vogue  he laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management  disliked factories  the raising of expensive products  and the buying of expensive seed corn  and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate  he always had before his mind s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it  the chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil  nor the oxygen in the air  nor manures  nor special plows  but that most important agent by which nitrogen  oxygen  manure  and plow were made effective the peasant laborer  when nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches  it was the serf who especially attracted his attention  the peasant seemed to him not merely a tool but also a judge of farming and an end in himself  at first he watched the serfs  trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad  and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods  their manner of speech  and their judgment of what was good and bad  only when he had understood the peasants  tastes and aspirations  had learned to talk their language  to grasp the hidden meaning of their words  and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs  that is  to perform toward them the duties demanded of him  and nicholas  management produced very brilliant results guided by some gift of insight  on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff  village elder  and delegate  the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose  and these posts never changed hands  before analyzing the properties of manure  before entering into the debit and credit as he ironically called it  he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means  he kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible  not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households  he was hard alike on the lazy  the depraved  and the weak  and tried to get them expelled from the commune he was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants  hay and corn as of his own  and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well  or got so good a return  as did nicholas he disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs the drones as he called them and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity  when a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf  especially if one had to be punished  he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house  but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation  he never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants  he knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions he did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man  or to make things easy for or reward anyone  merely because he felt inclined to do so  he could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do  but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind often  speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity  he would say  what can one do with our russian peasants  and imagined that he could not bear them yet he loved our russian peasants  and their way of life with his whole soul  and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results countess mary was jealous of this passion of her husband s and regretted that she could not share it  but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world  to her so remote and alien  she could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor  he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her  she did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well to do peasant matthew ermishin  who with his family had carted corn all night  or of the fact that his nicholas  sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in  she did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully  when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats  or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn  flushed  sunburned  and perspiring  with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and  gleefully rubbing his hands  would say  well one more day and my grain and the peasants  will all be under cover still less did she understand why he  kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes  should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work  why he  that kind nicholas  should obstinately refuse her  angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business  she felt he had a world apart  which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed sometimes when  trying to understand him  she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs  he would be vexed and reply  not in the least it never entered my head and i wouldn t do that for their good  that s all poetry and old wives  talk all that doing good to one s neighbor what i want is that our children should not have to go begging  i must put our affairs in order while i am alive  that s all  and to do that order and strictness are essential  that s all about it  said he clenching his vigorous fist  and fairness  of course  he added  for if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse  he can do no good either for himself or for me and all nicholas did was fruitful probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue s sake  his means increased rapidly  serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them  and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs  he was a master  the peasants  affairs first and then his own  of course he was not to be trifled with either in a word  he was a real master chapter viii one matter connected with his management sometimes worried nicholas  and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists  at first he saw nothing reprehensible in this but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed once in summer he had sent for the village elder from bogucharovo  a man who had succeeded to the post when dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities  nicholas went out into the porch to question him  and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard  on returning to lunch nicholas went up to his wife  who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame  and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning  among other things he spoke of the bogucharovo elder  countess mary turned red and then pale  but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply such an insolent scoundrel  he cried  growing hot again at the mere recollection of him  if he had told me he was drunk and did not see but what is the matter with you  mary  he suddenly asked countess mary raised her head and tried to speak  but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered why  whatever is the matter  my dearest the looks of the plain countess mary always improved when she was in tears  she never cried from pain or vexation  but always from sorrow or pity  and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm the moment nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry nicholas  i saw it  he was to blame  but why do you  nicholas  and she covered her face with her hands nicholas said nothing  he flushed crimson  left her side  and paced up and down the room  he understood what she was weeping about  but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong  is it just sentimentality  old wives  tales  or is she right  he asked himself before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain  and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself mary  he said softly  going up to her  it will never happen again  i give you my word  never  he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness the tears flowed faster still from the countess  eyes  she took his hand and kissed it nicholas  when did you break your cameo  she asked to change the subject  looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of laocoon s head today it was the same affair  oh  mary  don t remind me of it  and again he flushed  i give you my word of honor it shan t occur again and let this always be a reminder to me  and he pointed to the broken ring after that  when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench  nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry  but he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth  and then he would go and confess to his wife  and would again promise that this should really be the very last time mary  you must despise me  he would say  i deserve it you should go  go away at once  if you don t feel strong enough to control yourself  she would reply sadly  trying to comfort her husband among the gentry of the province nicholas was respected but not liked he did not concern himself with the interests of his own class  and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid  the whole summer  from spring sowing to harvest  he was busy with the work on his farm  in autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business like seriousness leaving home for a month  or even two  with his hunt  in winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading  the books he read were chiefly historical  and on these he spent a certain sum every year  he was collecting  as he said  a serious library  and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought he would sit in his study with a grave air  reading a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty  but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters  in winter  except for business excursions  he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children s relations with their mother  the harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her from the time of his marriage sonya had lived in his house  before that nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and sonya  blaming himself and commending her  he had asked princess mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin  she thoroughly realized the wrong he had done sonya  felt herself to blame toward her  and imagined that her wealth had influenced nicholas  choice  she could not find fault with sonya in any way and tried to be fond of her  but often felt ill will toward her which she could not overcome once she had a talk with her friend natasha about sonya and about her own injustice toward her you know  said natasha  you have read the gospels a great deal there is a passage in them that just fits sonya what  asked countess mary  surprised to him that hath shall be given  and from him that hath not shall be taken away  you remember  she is one that hath not  why  i don t know perhaps she lacks egotism  i don t know  but from her is taken away  and everything has been taken away  sometimes i am dreadfully sorry for her formerly i very much wanted nicholas to marry her  but i always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off  she is a sterile flower  you know like some strawberry blossoms  sometimes i am sorry for her  and sometimes i think she doesn t feel it as you or i would though countess mary told natasha that those words in the gospel must be understood differently  yet looking at sonya she agreed with natasha s explanation  it really seemed that sonya did not feel her position trying  and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower she seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole  like a cat  she had attached herself not to the people but to the home  she waited on the old countess  petted and spoiled the children was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude the country seat at bald hills had been rebuilt  though not on the same scale as under the old prince the buildings  begun under straitened circumstances  were more than simple  the immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood plastered only inside  it had bare deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas  armchairs  tables  and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood  the house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors  whole families of the rostovs  and bolkonskis  relations sometimes came to bald hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months  besides that  four times a year  on the name days and birthdays of the hosts  as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two  the rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations  and its breakfasts  lunches  dinners  and suppers provided out of the produce of the estate chapter ix it was the eve of st  nicholas  the fifth of december   natasha had been staying at her brother s with her husband and children since early autumn  pierre had gone to petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said  but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute besides the bezukhov family  nicholas  old friend the retired general vasili dmitrich denisov was staying with the rostovs this fifth of december on the sixth  which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors  nicholas knew he would have to exchange his tartar tunic for a tail coat  and put on narrow boots with pointed toes  and drive to the new church he had built  and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him  offer them refreshments  and talk about the elections of the nobility  but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way  he examined the bailiff s accounts of the village in ryazan which belonged to his wife s nephew  wrote two business letters  and walked over to the granaries  cattle yards and stables before dinner  having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint s day  he returned to dinner  and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons  at which the whole household had assembled  at that table were his mother his mother s old lady companion belova  his wife  their three children with their governess and tutor  his wife s nephew with his tutor  sonya denisov  natasha  her three children  their governess  and old michael ivanovich  the late prince s architect  who was living on in retirement at bald hills countess mary sat at the other end of the table  when her husband took his place she concluded  from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him  that he was out of humor  as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm especially before the soup countess mary well knew that mood of his  and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill humor  but today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason  and she felt unhappy  she asked him where he had been  he replied  she again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm  her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily then i m not mistaken  thought countess mary  why is he cross with me  she concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation  she knew her remarks sounded unnatural  but could not refrain from asking some more questions thanks to denisov the conversation at table soon became general and lively  and she did not talk to her husband  when they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess  countess mary held out her hand and kissed her husband  and asked him why he was angry with her you always have such strange fancies  i didn t even think of being angry  he replied but the word always seemed to her to imply  yes  i am angry but i won t tell you why nicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even sonya and the old countess  who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree could find nothing to reproach them with  but even they had their moments of antagonism  occasionally  and it was always just after they had been happiest together  they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility  which occurred most frequently during countess mary s pregnancies  and this was such a time well  messieurs et mesdames  said nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness it seemed to countess mary that he did it on purpose to vex her  i have been on my feet since six this morning  tomorrow i shall have to suffer  so today i ll go and rest and without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa that s always the way  thought countess mary  he talks to everyone except me  i see  i see that i am repulsive to him  especially when i am in this condition  she looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale  sallow  emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever and everything annoyed her denisov s shouting and laughter  natasha s talk  and especially a quick glance sonya gave her sonya was always the first excuse countess mary found for feeling irritated having sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying  she softly left the room and went to the nursery the children were playing at going to moscow  in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them  she sat down and played with them a little  but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her  she got up and  walking on tiptoe with difficulty  went to the small sitting room perhaps he is not asleep  i ll have an explanation with him  she said to herself  little andrew  her eldest boy  imitating his mother followed her on tiptoe  she did not notice him mary  dear  i think he is asleep he was so tired  said sonya  meeting her in the large sitting room it seemed to countess mary that she crossed her path everywhere  andrew may wake him countess mary looked round  saw little andrew following her  felt that sonya was right  and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh  she made no reply  but to avoid obeying sonya beckoned to andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door  sonya went away by another door  from the room in which nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing  every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife  as she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead  his mustache  and his whole face  as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept  nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat  and at that moment little andrew shouted from outside the door  papa  mamma s standing here  countess mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy  he grew silent  and quiet ensued for a moment  terrible to countess mary  she knew how nicholas disliked being waked  then through the door she heard nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring  and his voice said crossly i can t get a moment s peace  mary  is that you  why did you bring him here i only came in to look and did not notice  forgive me nicholas coughed and said no more  countess mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery  five minutes later little black eyed three year old natasha  her father s pet  having learned from her brother that papa was asleep and mamma was in the sitting room  ran to her father unobserved by her mother  the dark eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door  went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs  and having examined the position of her father who was asleep with his back to her  rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head  nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face natasha  natasha  came countess mary s frightened whisper from the door  papa wants to sleep no  mamma  he doesn t want to sleep  said little natasha with conviction  he s laughing nicholas lowered his legs  rose  and took his daughter in his arms come in  mary  he said to his wife she went in and sat down by her husband i did not notice him following me  she said timidly  i just looked in holding his little girl with one arm  nicholas glanced at his wife and seeing her guilty expression  put his other arm around her and kissed her hair may i kiss mamma  he asked natasha natasha smiled bashfully again  she commanded  pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where nicholas had placed the kiss i don t know why you think i am cross  said nicholas  replying to the question he knew was in his wife s mind you have no idea how unhappy  how lonely  i feel when you are like that  it always seems to me mary  don t talk nonsense  you ought to be ashamed of yourself  he said gaily it seems to be that you can t love me  that i am so plain  always and now  in this cond oh  how absurd you are  it is not beauty that endears  it s love that makes us see beauty  it is only malvinas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty  but do i love my wife  i don t love her  but i don t know how to put it  without you  or when something comes between us like this  i seem lost and can t do anything  now do i love my finger  i don t love it  but just try to cut it off i m not like that myself  but i understand  so you re not angry with me awfully angry  he said  smiling and getting up  and smoothing his hair he began to pace the room do you know  mary  what i ve been thinking  he began  immediately thinking aloud in his wife s presence now that they had made it up he did not ask if she was ready to listen to him  he did not care  a thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also  and he told her of his intention to persuade pierre to stay with them till spring countess mary listened till he had finished  made some remark  and in her turn began thinking aloud  her thoughts were about the children you can see the woman in her already  she said in french  pointing to little natasha  you reproach us women with being illogical  here is our logic  i say  papa wants to sleep  but she says  no  he s laughing and she was right  said countess mary with a happy smile yes  yes  and nicholas  taking his little daughter in his strong hand lifted her high  placed her on his shoulder  held her by the legs  and paced the room with her  there was an expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and daughter but you know you may be unfair  you are too fond of this one  his wife whispered in french yes  but what am i to do  i try not to show at that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in the hall and anteroom  as if someone had arrived somebody has come i am sure it is pierre  i will go and see  said countess mary and left the room in her absence nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room  out of breath  he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart  his capers reminded him of dancing  and looking at the child s round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man  taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced daniel cooper with his daughter it is he  it is he  nicholas  said countess mary  re entering the room a few minutes later  now our natasha has come to life  you should have seen her ecstasy  and how he caught it for having stayed away so long well  come along now  quick  quick  it s time you two were parted  she added  looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father nicholas went out holding the child by the hand countess mary remained in the sitting room i should never  never have believed that one could be so happy  she whispered to herself  a smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed  and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt through her happiness  that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant chapter x natasha had married in the early spring of  and in  already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing  she had grown stouter and broader  so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust  motherly woman the slim  lively natasha of former days  her features were more defined and had a calm  soft  and serene expression  in her face there was none of the ever glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm  now her face and body were often all that one saw  and her soul was not visible at all  all that struck the eye was a strong  handsome  and fertile woman  the old fire very rarely kindled in her face now  that happened only when  as was the case that day  her husband returned home or a sick child was convalescent  or when she and countess mary spoke of prince andrew she never mentioned him to her husband  who she imagined was jealous of prince andrew s memory  or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing  a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage  at the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome  fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days since their marriage natasha and her husband had lived in moscow  in petersburg  on their estate near moscow  or with her mother  that is to say  in nicholas  house  the young countess bezukhova was not often seen in society  and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable  not that natasha liked solitude she did not know whether she liked it or not  she even thought that she did not but with her pregnancies  her confinements  the nursing of her children  and sharing every moment of her husband s life she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society  all who had known natasha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary  only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all natasha s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband as she herself had once exclaimed at otradnoe not so much in fun as in earnest and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood natasha  and she kept saying that she had always known that natasha would make an exemplary wife and mother only she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds  said the countess  so that it even becomes absurd natasha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk especially by the french  which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries  should not neglect her accomplishments  should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried  and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband  natasha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part  she gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive  she took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech  or with her toilet  or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes  or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting  she acted in contradiction to all those rules  she felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband  to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely that is  with her whole soul  leaving no corner of it hidden from him  she felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her  but by something else indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul to fluff out her curls  put on fashionable dresses  and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself  to adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable she did not know but she had no time at all for it  the chief reason for devoting no time either to singing  to dress or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things we know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be  and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one s entire attention is devoted to it the subject which wholly engrossed natasha s attention was her family that is  her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home  and the children whom she had to bear bring into the world  nurse  and bring up and the deeper she penetrated  not with her mind only but with her whole soul  her whole being  into the subject that absorbed her  the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear  so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary there were then as now conversations and discussions about women s rights  the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now  but these topics were not merely uninteresting to natasha  she positively did not understand them these questions  then as now  existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another  that is only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance  which lies in the family discussions and questions of that kind  which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from one s dinner  did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords  and the purpose of marriage is the family if the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body  a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose  for his stomach will not digest the two dinners if the purpose of marriage is the family  the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure  but in that case will not have a family if the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family  the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest  and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family that is  one wife or one husband  natasha needed a husband a husband was given her and he gave her a family  and she not only saw no need of any other or better husband  but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family  she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different natasha did not care for society in general  but prized the more the society of her relatives countess mary  and her brother  her mother and sonya  she valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown  and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby s napkin  and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better to such an extent had natasha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair  her ill chosen words  and her jealousy she was jealous of sonya  of the governess  and of every woman  pretty or plain were habitual subjects of jest to those about her  the general opinion was that pierre was under his wife s thumb  which was really true  from the very first days of their married life natasha had announced her demands  pierre was greatly surprised by his wife s view  to him a perfectly novel one  that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family  his wife s demands astonished him  but they also flattered him  and he submitted to them pierre s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with  but dared not even speak smilingly to  any other woman  did not dare dine at the club as a pastime  did not dare spend money on a whim  and did not dare absent himself for any length of time  except on business in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits  which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance  to make up for this  at home pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose  at home natasha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied that is was reading or writing in his study  pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always  he had only to express a wish and natasha would jump up and run to fulfill it the entire household was governed according to pierre s supposed orders that is  by his wishes which natasha tried to guess  their way of life and place of residence  their acquaintances and ties  natasha s occupations  the children s upbringing  were all selected not merely with regard to pierre s expressed wishes  but to what natasha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be  and she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly  and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously  when pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons thus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate  when they had to change the wet nurse three times and natasha fell ill from despair  pierre one day told her of rousseau s view  with which he quite agreed  that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful  when her next baby was born  despite the opposition of her mother  the doctors  and even of her husband himself who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself  a thing then unheard of and considered injurious she insisted on having her own way  and after that nursed all her babies herself it very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute  but long afterwards pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife s ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued  but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion after seven years of marriage pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man  and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife  he felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping  but only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife  all that was not quite good was rejected and this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection chapter xi two months previously when pierre was already staying with the rostovs he had received a letter from prince theodore  asking him to come to petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which pierre was one of the principal founders on reading that letter she always read her husband s letters  natasha herself suggested that he should go to petersburg  though she would feel his absence very acutely  she attributed immense importance to all her husband s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them  and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters  to pierre s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go  but to fix a definite date for his return he was given four weeks  leave of absence ever since that leave of absence had expired  more than a fortnight before  natasha had been in a constant state of alarm  depression  and irritability denisov  now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs  had arrived during that fortnight  he looked at natasha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear  a dull  dejected look  random replies  and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress natasha was sad and irritable all that time  especially when her mother her brother  sonya  or countess mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning it s all nonsense  all rubbish those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies  natasha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed and she would go to the nursery to nurse petya  her only boy  no one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little three month old creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose  that creature said  you are angry  you are jealous  you would like to pay him out  you are afraid but here am i  and i am he  and that was unanswerable  it was more than true during that fortnight of anxiety natasha resorted to the baby for comfort so often  and fussed over him so much  that she overfed him and he fell ill  she was terrified by his illness  and yet that was just what she needed  while attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily she was nursing her boy when the sound of pierre s sleigh was heard at the front door  and the old nurse knowing how to please her mistress entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face has he come  natasha asked quickly in a whisper  afraid to move lest she should rouse the dozing baby he s come  ma am  whispered the nurse the blood rushed to natasha s face and her feet involuntarily moved  but she could not jump up and run out  the baby again opened his eyes and looked at her  you re here  he seemed to be saying  and again lazily smacked his lips cautiously withdrawing her breast  natasha rocked him a little  handed him to the nurse  and went with rapid steps toward the door  but at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon  and she glanced round  the nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot go  ma am  don t worry  go  she whispered  smiling  with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress natasha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom denisov  who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe  now for the first time recognized the old natasha  a flood of brilliant  joyful light poured from her transfigured face he s come  she exclaimed as she ran past  and denisov felt that he too was delighted that pierre  whom he did not much care for  had returned on reaching the vestibule natasha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf  it s he  it s really he  he has come  she said to herself  and rushing at him embraced him  pressed his head to her breast  and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy  happy face covered with hoarfrost  yes  it is he  happy and contented then all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight  and the joy that had lit up her face vanished  she frowned and overwhelmed pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words yes  it s all very well for you  you are pleased  you ve had a good time  but what about me  you might at least have shown consideration for the children  i am nursing and my milk was spoiled  petya was at death s door  but you were enjoying yourself  yes  enjoying pierre knew he was not to blame  for he could not have come sooner  he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy  he wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so  he made a piteous frightened face and bent down i could not  on my honor  but how is petya all right now  come along  i wonder you re not ashamed  if only you could see what i was like without you  how i suffered you are well come  come  she said  not letting go of his arm  and they went to their rooms when nicholas and his wife came to look for pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son  who was again awake  on his huge right palm and dandling him  a blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby s broad face with its toothless open mouth  the storm was long since over and there was bright  joyous sunshine on natasha s face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child and have you talked everything well over with prince theodore  she asked yes  capitally you see  he holds it up  she meant the baby s head  but how he did frighten me  you ve seen the princess  is it true she s in love with that yes  just fancy at that moment nicholas and countess mary came in  pierre with the baby on his hand stooped  kissed them  and replied to their inquiries  but in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed  the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention how sweet  said countess mary  looking at and playing with the baby now  nicholas  she added  turning to her husband  i can t understand how it is you don t see the charm of these delicious marvels i don t and can t  replied nicholas  looking coldly at the baby  a lump of flesh  come along  pierre and yet he s such an affectionate father  said countess mary vindicating her husband  but only after they are a year old or so now  pierre nurses them splendidly  said natasha  he says his hand is just made for a baby s seat  just look only not for this  pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh  and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse chapter xii as in every large household  there were at bald hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole  though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others  every event  joyful or sad  that took place in that house was important to all these worlds  but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others for instance  pierre s return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so the servants the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life were glad of pierre s return because they knew that when he was there count nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate  and would be in better spirits and temper  and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays the children and their governesses were glad of pierre s return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did he alone could play on the clavichord that ecossaise his only piece  to which  as he said  all possible dances could be danced  and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all young nicholas  now a slim lad of fifteen  delicate and intelligent with curly light brown hair and beautiful eyes  was delighted because uncle pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection  no one had instilled into him this love for pierre whom he saw only occasionally  countess mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him  and little nicholas did love his uncle  but loved him with just a shade of contempt  pierre  however  he adored  he did not want to be an hussar or a knight of st  george like his uncle nicholas  he wanted to be learned wise  and kind like pierre  in pierre s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when pierre spoke to him  he did not miss a single word he uttered  and would afterwards with dessalles or by himself  recall and reconsider the meaning of everything pierre had said  pierre s past life and his unhappiness prior to  of which young nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard  his adventures in moscow  his captivity platon karataev of whom he had heard from pierre  his love for natasha of whom the lad was also particularly fond  and especially pierre s friendship with the father whom nicholas could not remember all this made pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint from broken remarks about natasha and his father  from the emotion with which pierre spoke of that dead father  and from the careful  reverent tenderness with which natasha spoke of him  the boy  who was only just beginning to guess what love is  derived the notion that his father had loved natasha and when dying had left her to his friend  but the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured  and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture  so the boy also was happy that pierre had arrived the guests welcomed pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in the grown up members of the family  not to mention his wife  were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully the old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them  and especially that natasha would now be herself again pierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations though the most absent minded and forgetful of men  pierre  with the aid of a list his wife drew up  had now bought everything  not forgetting his mother and brother in law s commissions  nor the dress material for a present to belova  nor toys for his wife s nephews  in the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy  and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything  but in time he grew used to this demand  knowing that natasha asked nothing for herself  and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them  he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house  and never forgot anything  if he now incurred natasha s censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things  to her other defects as most people thought them  but which to pierre were qualities  of untidiness and neglect of herself  she now added stinginess from the time that pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure  he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before  and that his affairs which had been in disorder of late  chiefly because of his first wife s debts had begun to improve life was cheaper because it was circumscribed  that most expensive luxury  the kind of life that can be changed at any moment  was no longer his nor did he wish for it  he felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power  and so that way of life proved economical with a merry  smiling face pierre was sorting his purchases what do you think of this  said he  unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman natasha  who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap  turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her that s for belova  excellent  she felt the quality of the material it was a ruble an arshin  i suppose pierre told her the price too dear  natasha remarked  how pleased the children will be and mamma too  only you need not have bought me this  she added  unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls of a kind then just coming into fashion adele tempted me  she kept on telling me to buy it  returned pierre when am i to wear it  and natasha stuck it in her coil of hair  when i take little masha into society  perhaps they will be fashionable again by then  well  let s go now and collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess  rooms the countess was sitting with her companion belova  playing grand patience as usual  when pierre and natasha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms the countess was now over sixty  was quite gray  and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face  her face had shriveled  her upper lip had sunk in  and her eyes were dim after the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession  she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence  she ate  drank  slept  or kept awake  but did not live  life gave her no new impressions  she wanted nothing from life but tranquillity  and that tranquillity only death could give her  but until death came she had to go on living  that is to use her vital forces  a peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her  her life had no external aims only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent  she had to eat  sleep  think  speak  weep work  give vent to her anger  and so on  merely because she had a stomach  a brain  muscles  nerves  and a liver  she did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do  when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed  she talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs  she cried as a child does because her nose had to be cleared  and so on  what for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext thus in the morning especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext belova s deafness she would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room it seems a little warmer today  my dear  she would murmur and when belova replied  oh yes  they ve come  she would mutter angrily  o lord  how stupid and deaf she is another pretext would be her snuff  which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough  after these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow  and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when belova would again be deaf  the snuff damp  and the countess  face yellow  just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her still existing faculty of thinking and the pretext for that was a game of patience  when she needed to cry  the deceased count would be the pretext  when she wanted to be agitated  nicholas and his health would be the pretext  and when she felt a need to speak spitefully  the pretext would be countess mary  when her vocal organs needed exercise which was usually toward seven o clock when she had had an after dinner rest in a darkened room  the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience the old lady s condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it  and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs  only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between nicholas  pierre  natasha  and countess mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed but those glances expressed something more  they said that she had played her part in life  that what they now saw was not her whole self that we must all become like her  and that they were glad to yield to her  to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves  but now so much to be pitied  memento mori  said these glances only the really heartless  the stupid ones of that household  and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her chapter xiii when pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience  and so though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when pierre or her son returned after an absence  high time  my dear  high time  we were all weary of waiting for you  well  thank god  and received her presents with another customary remark  it s not the gift that s precious  my dear  but that you give it to me  an old woman yet it was evident that she was not pleased by pierre s arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game she finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents they consisted of a box for cards  of splendid workmanship  a bright blue sevres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid and a gold snuffbox with the count s portrait on the lid which pierre had had done by a miniaturist in petersburg  the countess had long wished for such a box  but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards thank you  my dear  you have cheered me up  said she as she always did  but best of all you have brought yourself back for i never saw anything like it  you ought to give your wife a scolding  what are we to do with her  she is like a mad woman when you are away  doesn t see anything  doesn t remember anything  she went on  repeating her usual phrases  look  anna timofeevna  she added to her companion  see what a box for cards my son has brought us belova admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material though pierre  natasha  nicholas  countess mary  and denisov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess not that anything was hidden from her  but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times  that so and so was dead and so and so was married  which she would again be unable to remember yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit  and pierre answered the countess  questions as to whether prince vasili had aged and whether countess mary alexeevna had sent greetings and still thought of them  and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent conversation of this kind  interesting to no one yet unavoidable continued all through teatime  all the grown up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which sonya presided beside the samovar  the children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room  at tea all sat in their accustomed places  nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him  milka  the old gray borzoi bitch daughter of the first milka  with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever  lay on the armchair beside him  denisov  whose curly hair  mustache  and whiskers had turned half gray  sat beside countess mary with his general s tunic unbuttoned pierre sat between his wife and the old countess  he spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand  he told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real  living  and distinct group  but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years  but to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society  natasha saw by pierre s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess  denisov not being a member of the family  did not understand pierre s caution and being  as a malcontent  much interested in what was occurring in petersburg  kept urging pierre to tell them about what had happened in the semenovsk regiment  then about arakcheev  and then about the bible society  once or twice pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things  but nicholas and natasha always brought him back to the health of prince ivan and countess mary alexeevna well  and all this idiocy gossner and tatawinova  denisov asked  is that weally still going on going on  pierre exclaimed  why more than ever  the bible society is the whole government now what is that  mon cher ami  asked the countess  who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal  what are you saying about the government  i don t understand well  you know  maman  nicholas interposed  knowing how to translate things into his mother s language  prince alexander golitsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence  they say arakcheev and golitsyn  incautiously remarked pierre  are now the whole government  and what a government  they see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything well  and how is prince alexander to blame  he is a most estimable man i used to meet him at mary antonovna s  said the countess in an offended tone  and still more offended that they all remained silent she went on  nowadays everyone finds fault  a gospel society  well  and what harm is there in that  and she rose everybody else got up too and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room the melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the children s voices and laughter from the next room  evidently some jolly excitement was going on there finished  finished  little natasha s gleeful yell rose above them all pierre exchanged glances with countess mary and nicholas natasha he never lost sight of  and smiled happily that s delightful music  said he it means that anna makarovna has finished her stocking  said countess mary oh  i ll go and see  said pierre  jumping up  you know  he added stopping at the door  why i m especially fond of that music  it is always the first thing that tells me all is well  when i was driving here today  the nearer i got to the house the more anxious i grew  as i entered the anteroom i heard andrusha s peals of laughter and that meant that all was well i know  i know that feeling  said nicholas  but i mustn t go there those stockings are to be a surprise for me pierre went to the children  and the shouting and laughter grew still louder come  anna makarovna  pierre s voice was heard saying  come here into the middle of the room and at the word of command  one  two  and when i say three  you stand here  and you in my arms well now  one two  said pierre  and a silence followed  three  and a rapturously breathless cry of children s voices filled the room  two  two  they shouted this meant two stockings  which by a secret process known only to herself anna makarovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles  and which  when they were ready  she always triumphantly drew one out of the other  in the children s presence chapter xiv soon after this the children came in to say good night  they kissed everyone  the tutors and governesses made their bows  and they went out only young nicholas and his tutor remained  dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs no  monsieur dessalles  i will ask my aunt to let me stay  replied nicholas bolkonski also in a whisper ma tante  please let me stay  said he  going up to his aunt his face expressed entreaty  agitation  and ecstasy  countess mary glanced at him and turned to pierre when you are here he can t tear himself away  she said i will bring him to you directly  monsieur dessalles  good night  said pierre  giving his hand to the swiss tutor  and he turned to young nicholas with a smile  you and i haven t seen anything of one another yet  how like he is growing  mary  he added  addressing countess mary like my father  asked the boy  flushing crimson and looking up at pierre with bright  ecstatic eyes pierre nodded  and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted  countess mary sat down doing woolwork  natasha did not take her eyes off her husband  nicholas and denisov rose  asked for their pipes  smoked  went to fetch more tea from sonya who sat weary but resolute at the samovar and questioned pierre  the curly headed  delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner starting every now and then and muttering something to himself  and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head  with his thin neck exposed by his turn down collar  toward the place where pierre sat the conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power in which most people see the chief interest of home politics  denisov dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service  heard with pleasure of the things done in petersburg which seemed to him stupid  and made forcible and sharp comments on what pierre told them one used to have to be a german now one must dance with tatawinova and madame kwudener  and wead ecka tshausen and the bwethwen  oh  they should let that fine fellow bonaparte loose he d knock all this nonsense out of them  fancy giving the command of the semenov wegiment to a fellow like that schwa tz  he cried nicholas  though free from denisov s readiness to find fault with everything  also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter  and the fact that a had been appointed minister of this and b governor general of that  and that the emperor had said so and so and this minister so and so  seemed to him very important  and so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question pierre  the questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles but natasha  knowing all her husband s ways and ideas  saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to petersburg to consult with his new friend prince theodore  and she helped him by asking how his affairs with prince theodore had gone what was it about  asked nicholas always the same thing  said pierre  looking round at his listeners everybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can what can decent men do  nicholas inquired  frowning slightly  what can be done why  this come into my study  said nicholas natasha  who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby  now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery  countess mary followed her  the men went into the study and little nicholas bolkonski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window well  what would you do  asked denisov always some fantastic schemes  said nicholas why this  began pierre  not sitting down but pacing the room sometimes stopping short  gesticulating  and lisping  the position in petersburg is this  the emperor does not look into anything  he has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism  pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone now  he seeks only for peace  and only these people sans foi ni loi  can give it him people who recklessly hack at and strangle everything magnitski  arakcheev  and tutti quanti  you will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life  the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained  he said to nicholas  without faith or law well  what does that lead up to  said nicholas well  everything is going to ruin  robbery in the law courts  in the army nothing but flogging  drilling  and military settlements  the people are tortured  enlightenment is suppressed  all that is young and honest is crushed  everyone sees that this cannot go on  everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break  said pierre as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began  i told them just one thing in petersburg told whom well  you know whom  said pierre  with a meaning glance from under his brows  prince theodore and all those  to encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course  the aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed at that moment nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew  his face darkened and he went up to the boy why are you here why  let him be  said pierre  taking nicholas by the arm and continuing  that is not enough  i told them  something else is needed when you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe  as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity  everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved  one is lured by women  another by honors  a third by ambition or money  and they go over to that camp  no independent men  such as you or i  are left  what i say is widen the scope of our society  let the mot d ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well nicholas  who had left his nephew  irritably pushed up an armchair  sat down in it  and listened to pierre  coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more but action with what aim  he cried  and what position will you adopt toward the government why  the position of assistants  the society need not be secret if the government allows it  not merely is it not hostile to government  but it is a society of true conservatives a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word  it is only to prevent some pugachev or other from killing my children and yours  and arakcheev from sending me off to some military settlement  we join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety yes  but it s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm why  did the tugendbund which saved europe  they did not then venture to suggest that russia had saved europe  do any harm  the tugendbund is an alliance of virtue  it is love  mutual help  it is what christ preached on the cross natasha  who had come in during the conversation  looked joyfully at her husband  it was not what he was saying that pleased her that did not even interest her  for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from pierre s whole soul  but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad the boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn down collar whom everyone had forgotten gazed at pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy  every word of pierre s burned into his heart  and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle s table it is not at all what you suppose  but that is what the german tugendbund was  and what i am proposing no  my fwiend  the tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters but i don t understand it and can t even pwonounce it  interposed denisov in a loud and resolute voice  i agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible  but the tugendbund i don t understand  if we re not satisfied  let us have a bunt of our own  that s all wight  je suis vot e homme   i m your man pierre smiled  natasha began to laugh  but nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination  pierre maintained the contrary  and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful  nicholas felt himself cornered  this made him still angrier  for he was fully convinced  not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason  of the justice of his opinion i will tell you this  he said  rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner  but finally abandoning the attempt  i can t prove it to you  you say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming  i don t see it  but you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter  and to that i reply  you are my best friend  as you know  but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government be it what it may i know it is my duty to obey the government  and if arakcheev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down  i should not hesitate an instant  but should do it  and you may argue about that as you like an awkward silence followed these words  natasha was the first to speak defending her husband and attacking her brother  her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object  the conversation was resumed  and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of nicholas  last remark when they all got up to go in to supper  little nicholas bolkonski went up to pierre  pale and with shining  radiant eyes uncle pierre  you  no  if papa were alive  would he agree with you  he asked and pierre suddenly realized what a special  independent  complex  and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation  and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him  he had  however  to give him an answer yes  i think so  he said reluctantly  and left the study the lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table  he flushed and went up to nicholas uncle  forgive me  i did that  unintentionally  he said  pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens nicholas started angrily all right  all right  he said  throwing the bits under the table and evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty  he turned away from the boy you ought not to have been here at all  he said chapter xv the conversation at supper was not about politics or societies  but turned on the subject nicholas liked best recollections of denisov started these and pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them  the family separated on the most friendly terms after supper nicholas  having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him  went to the bedroom in his dressing gown  where he found his wife still at her table  writing what are you writing  mary  nicholas asked countess mary blushed  she was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband she had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him  but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him a diary  nicholas  she replied  handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm  bold writing a diary  nicholas repeated with a shade of irony  and he took up the book it was in french december  today when andrusha her eldest boy  woke up he did not wish to dress and mademoiselle louise sent for me  he was naughty and obstinate  i tried threats  but he only grew angrier  then i took the matter in hand  i left him alone and began with nurse s help to get the other children up  telling him that i did not love him  for a long time he was silent  as if astonished  then he jumped out of bed  ran to me in his shirt  and sobbed so that i could not calm him for a long time  it was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me afterwards in the evening when i gave him his ticket  he again began crying piteously and kissing me  one can do anything with him by tenderness what is a ticket  nicholas inquired i have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening  showing how they have behaved nicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him  and continued to turn over the pages and read  in the diary was set down everything in the children s lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods  they were for the most part quite insignificant trifles  but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either  now that he read this diary about his children for the first time under the date  was entered mitya was naughty at table  papa said he was to have no pudding  he had none  but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating  i think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness  must tell nicholas this nicholas put down the book and looked at his wife  the radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly  would he approve or disapprove of her diary there could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife perhaps it need not be done so pedantically  thought nicholas  or even done at all  but this untiring  continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children s moral welfare delighted him  had nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady tender  and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world  almost beyond his reach in which she had her being he was proud of her intelligence and goodness  recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world  and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself i quite  quite approve  my dearest  said he with a significant look and after a short pause he added  and i behaved badly today  you weren t in the study  we began disputing pierre and i and i lost my temper  but he is impossible  such a child  i don t know what would become of him if natasha didn t keep him in hand  have you any idea why he went to petersburg  they have formed yes  i know  said countess mary  natasha told me well  then  you know  nicholas went on  growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion  he wanted to convince me that it is every honest man s duty to go against the government  and that the oath of allegiance and duty  i am sorry you weren t there  they all fell on me denisov and natasha  natasha is absurd  how she rules over him and yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings  added nicholas  yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us  he forgot that what he was saying about natasha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife yes  i have noticed that  said countess mary when i told him that duty and the oath were above everything  he started proving goodness knows what  a pity you were not there what would you have said as i see it you were quite right  and i told natasha so  pierre says everybody is suffering  tortured  and being corrupted  and that it is our duty to help our neighbor  of course he is right there  said countess mary  but he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us duties indicated to us by god himself  and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children yes  that s it  that s just what i said to him  put in nicholas  who fancied he really had said it  but they insisted on their own view love of one s neighbor and christianity and all this in the presence of young nicholas  who had gone into my study and broke all my things ah  nicholas  do you know i am often troubled about little nicholas said countess mary  he is such an exceptional boy  i am afraid i neglect him in favor of my own  we all have children and relations while he has no one  he is constantly alone with his thoughts well  i don t think you need reproach yourself on his account  all that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him  and of course i am glad of it  he is a fine lad  a fine lad  this evening he listened to pierre in a sort of trance  and fancy as we were going in to supper i looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits  and he told me of it himself at once  i never knew him to tell an untruth  a fine lad  a fine lad  repeated nicholas  who at heart was not fond of nicholas bolkonski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad still  i am not the same as his own mother  said countess mary  i feel i am not the same and it troubles me  a wonderful boy  but i am dreadfully afraid for him  it would be good for him to have companions well it won t be for long  next summer i ll take him to petersburg said nicholas  yes  pierre always was a dreamer and always will be  he continued  returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him  well  what business is it of mine what goes on there whether arakcheev is bad  and all that  what business was it of mine when i married and was so deep in debt that i was threatened with prison  and had a mother who could not see or understand it  and then there are you and the children and our affairs  is it for my own pleasure that i am at the farm or in the office from morning to night no  but i know i must work to comfort my mother  to repay you  and not to leave the children such beggars as i was countess mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters  but she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so  she only took his hand and kissed it  he took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts  and after a few minutes  reflection continued to think aloud you know  mary  today elias mitrofanych  this was his overseer  came back from the tambov estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest and with an eager face nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing otradnoe before long  and added  another ten years of life and i shall leave the children  in an excellent position countess mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her  she knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying  and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else  but she had to force herself to attend  for what he was saying did not interest her at all  she looked at him and did not think  but felt  about something different  she felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood  and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness  besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband s plans  thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind  she thought of her nephew her husband s account of the boy s agitation while pierre was speaking struck her forcibly  and various traits of his gentle  sensitive character recurred to her mind  and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children  she did not compare them with him  but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him  and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young nicholas sometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages  but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible in this life to love her husband  her children  little nicholas  and all her neighbors  as christ loved mankind  countess mary s soul always strove toward the infinite  the eternal  and the absolute  and could therefore never be at peace  a stern expression of the lofty  secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face  nicholas gazed at her  o god  what will become of us if she dies  as i always fear when her face is like that  thought he  and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers chapter xvi natasha and pierre  left alone  also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk  that is  with extraordinary clearness and rapidity understanding and expressing each other s thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic  without premises  deductions  or conclusions  and in a quite peculiar way  natasha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if pierre followed a line of logical reasoning  when he began proving anything  or talking argumentatively and calmly and she led on by his example  began to do the same  she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel from the moment they were alone and natasha came up to him with wide open happy eyes  and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom saying  now you are all mine  mine  you won t escape from that moment this conversation began  contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time  this simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another just as in a dream when all is uncertain  unreasoning  and contradictory  except the feeling that guides the dream  so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason  the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them natasha spoke to pierre about her brother s life and doings  of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence  and of how she was fonder than ever of mary  and how mary was in every way better than herself  in saying this natasha was sincere in acknowledging mary s superiority  but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on pierre that he should  all the same  prefer her to mary and to all other women  and that now  especially after having seen many women in petersburg  he should tell her so afresh pierre  answering natasha s words  told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in petersburg i have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies  he said  it was simply dull  besides  i was very busy natasha looked intently at him and went on mary is so splendid  she said  how she understands children  it is as if she saw straight into their souls  yesterday  for instance  mitya was naughty how like his father he is  pierre interjected natasha knew why he mentioned mitya s likeness to nicholas  the recollection of his dispute with his brother in law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what natasha thought of it nicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted  but i understand that you value what opens up a fresh line said she  repeating words pierre had once uttered no  the chief point is that to nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement almost a pastime  said pierre  for instance  he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought sismondi and rousseau and montesquieu  he added with a smile  you know how much i  he began to soften down what he had said  but natasha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary so you say ideas are an amusement to him yes  and for me nothing else is serious  all the time in petersburg i saw everyone as in a dream  when i am taken up by a thought  all else is mere amusement ah  i m so sorry i wasn t there when you met the children  said natasha  which was most delighted  lisa  i m sure yes  pierre replied  and went on with what was in his mind  nicholas says we ought not to think  but i can t help it  besides  when i was in petersburg i felt i can say this to you  that the whole affair would go to pieces without me everyone was pulling his own way  but i succeeded in uniting them all  and then my idea is so clear and simple  you see  i don t say that we ought to oppose this and that  we may be mistaken what i say is  join hands  you who love the right  and let there be but one banner that of active virtue  prince sergey is a fine fellow and clever natasha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of pierre s idea but one thing disconcerted her  can a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband  how did this happen  she wished to express this doubt to him  now who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others  she asked herself  and passed in review all those whom pierre most respected  judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as platon karataev do you know what i am thinking about  she asked  about platon karataev  would he have approved of you now  do you think pierre was not at all surprised at this question  he understood his wife s line of thought platon karataev  he repeated  and pondered  evidently sincerely trying to imagine karataev s opinion on the subject  he would not have understood  yet perhaps he would i love you awfully  natasha suddenly said  awfully  awfully no  he would not have approved  said pierre  after reflection  what he would have approved of is our family life  he was always so anxious to find seemliness  happiness  and peace in everything  and i should have been proud to let him see us  there now you talk of my absence but you wouldn t believe what a special feeling i have for you after a separation yes  i should think  natasha began no  it s not that  i never leave off loving you  and one couldn t love more  but this is something special  yes  of course  he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest what nonsense it is  natasha suddenly exclaimed  about honeymoons and that the greatest happiness is at first  on the contrary  now is the best of all  if only you did not go away  do you remember how we quarreled  and it was always my fault  always mine  and what we quarreled about i don t even remember always about the same thing  said pierre with a smile  jealo don t say it  i can t bear it  natasha cried  and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively  did you see her  she added  after a pause no  and if i had i shouldn t have recognized her they were silent for a while oh  do you know  while you were talking in the study i was looking at you  natasha began  evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them  you are as like him as two peas like the boy  she meant her little son  oh  it s time to go to him  the milk s come  but i m sorry to leave you they were silent for a few seconds  then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak  pierre began with self satisfaction and enthusiasm  natasha with a quiet  happy smile  having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue no  what did you say  go on  go on no  you go on  i was talking nonsense  said natasha pierre finished what he had begun  it was the sequel to his complacent reflections on his success in petersburg  at that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of russian society and to the whole world i only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones  my whole idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a power  then honest folk must do the same  now that s simple enough yes and what were you going to say i  only nonsense but all the same oh nothing  only a trifle  said natasha  smilingly still more brightly  i only wanted to tell you about petya  today nurse was coming to take him from me  and he laughed  shut his eyes  and clung to me  i m sure he thought he was hiding  awfully sweet  there  now he s crying well  good by  and she left the room meanwhile downstairs in young nicholas bolkonski s bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual  the boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it  dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring  little nicholas  who had just waked up in a cold perspiration  sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide open eyes  he had awaked from a terrible dream  he had dreamed that he and uncle pierre  wearing helmets such as were depicted in his plutarch  were leading a huge army  the army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which dessalles called les fils de la vierge  in front was glory  which was similar to those threads but rather thicker  he and pierre were borne along lightly and joyously  nearer and nearer to their goal  suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move  and uncle nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude have you done this  he said  pointing to some broken sealing wax and pens  i loved you  but i have orders from arakcheev and will kill the first of you who moves forward  little nicholas turned to look at pierre but pierre was no longer there  in his place was his father prince andrew and his father had neither shape nor form  but he existed  and when little nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love he felt himself powerless  limp  and formless  his father caressed and pitied him  but uncle nicholas came nearer and nearer to them  terror seized young nicholas and he awoke my father  he thought  though there were two good portraits of prince andrew in the house  nicholas never imagined him in human form  my father has been with me and caressed me  he approved of me and of uncle pierre  whatever he may tell me  i will do it  mucius scaevola burned his hand  why should not the same sort of thing happen to me  i know they want me to learn  and i will learn  but someday i shall have finished learning  and then i will do something  i only pray god that something may happen to me such as happened to plutarch s men  and i will act as they did  i will do better  everyone shall know me  love me and be delighted with me  and suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry are you ill  he heard dessalles  voice asking no  answered nicholas  and lay back on his pillow he is good and kind and i am fond of him  he thought of dessalles but uncle pierre  oh  what a wonderful man he is  and my father  oh father  father  yes  i will do something with which even he would be satisfied second epilogue chapter i history is the life of nations and of humanity  to seize and put into words  to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation  appears impossible the ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive the life of a people  they described the activity of individuals who ruled the people  and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation the question  how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided  the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man  and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined for the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the deity in human affairs modern history  in theory  rejects both these principles it would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man s subjection to the deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led  modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it  but modern history has not done this  having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients  it still follows them in practice instead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of god  modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary  superhuman capacities  or simply men of very various kinds  from monarchs to journalists  who lead the masses  instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the jewish  greek  or roman nations which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity  modern history has postulated its own aims the welfare of the french  german  or english people  or  in its highest abstraction  the welfare and civilization of humanity in general  by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent modern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception  and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians  after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the fate  of the ancients  to reach the same conclusion by another road  that is  to recognize  nations guided by individual men  and  the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending at the basis of the works of all the modern historians from gibbon to buckle  despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks  lie those two old  unavoidable assumptions in the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity one historian considers only monarchs  generals  and ministers as being such men  while another includes also orators  learned men  reformers  philosophers  and poets secondly  it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians  to one of them this goal is the greatness of the roman  spanish  or french realm  to another it is liberty  equality and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called europe in  a ferment arises in paris  it grows  spreads  and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east  several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward  in  it reaches its extreme limit  moscow  and then  with remarkable symmetry  a countermovement occurs from east to west  attracting to it as the first movement had done  the nations of middle europe  the counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west paris and subsides during that twenty year period an immense number of fields were left untilled  houses were burned  trade changed its direction  millions of men migrated  were impoverished  or were enriched  and millions of christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another what does all this mean  why did it happen  what made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men  what were the causes of these events what force made men act so  these are the instinctive  plain  and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period for a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history  whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves if history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that god  to reward or punish his people  gave napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends  and that reply would have been clear and complete  one might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of napoleon  but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period  nor would there have been any contradictions but modern history cannot give that reply  science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the deity in human affairs  and therefore history ought to give other answers modern history replying to these questions says  you want to know what this movement means  what caused it  and what force produced these events  then listen louis xiv was a very proud and self confident man  he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled france badly  his descendants were weak men and they too ruled france badly  and they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses  moreover  certain men wrote some books at that time  at the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal  this caused people all over france to begin to slash at and drown one another  they killed the king and many other people  at that time there was in france a man of genius napoleon  he conquered everybody everywhere that is  he killed many people because he was a great genius  and for some reason he went to kill africans  and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to france he ordered everybody to obey him  and they all obeyed him  having become an emperor he again went out to kill people in italy  austria and prussia  and there too he killed a great many  in russia there was an emperor  alexander  who decided to restore order in europe and therefore fought against napoleon  in  he suddenly made friends with him  but in  they again quarreled and again began killing many people  napoleon led six hundred thousand men into russia and captured moscow  then he suddenly ran away from moscow  and the emperor alexander  helped by the advice of stein and others  united europe to arm against the disturber of its peace  all napoleon s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised  the allies defeated napoleon  entered paris  forced napoleon to abdicate  and sent him to the island of elba  not depriving him of the title of emperor and showing him every respect  though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand then louis xviii  who till then had been the laughingstock both of the french and the allies  began to reign  and napoleon  shedding tears before his old guards  renounced the throne and went into exile  then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists especially talleyrand  who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of france  talked in vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy  suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another  but just then napoleon arrived in france with a battalion  and the french  who had been hating him  immediately all submitted to him  but the allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the french once more  and they defeated the genius napoleon and  suddenly recognizing him as a brigand  sent him to the island of st  helena  and the exile  separated from the beloved france so dear to his heart  died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity  but in europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects it would be a mistake to think that this is ironic a caricature of the historical accounts  on the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies  not meeting the questions  which all the historians give  from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period the strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history  like a deaf man  answers questions no one has asked if the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples  the first question in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible is  what is the power that moves peoples  to this  modern history laboriously replies either that napoleon was a great genius  or that louis xiv was very proud  or that certain writers wrote certain books all that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it  but it is not what was asked  all that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through napoleons  louis es  and writers  but we do not acknowledge such a power  and therefore before speaking about napoleons  louis es  and authors  we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations if instead of a divine power some other force has appeared  it should be explained in what this new force consists  for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force history seems to assume that this force is self evident and known to everyone  but in spite of every desire to regard it as known  anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force  so variously understood by the historians themselves  is really quite well known to everybody chapter ii what force moves the nations biographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers  in their narration events occur solely by the will of a napoleon  and alexander  or in general of the persons they describe  the answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event as soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event  the replies they give immediately lose all meaning  for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways  one historian says that an event was produced by napoleon s power  another that it was produced by alexander s  a third that it was due to the power of some other person besides this  historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based  thiers  a bonapartist  says that napoleon s power was based on his virtue and genius  lanfrey  a republican  says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people  so the historians of this class  by mutually destroying one another s positions  destroy the understanding of the force which produces events  and furnish no reply to history s essential question writers of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians  view of the force which produces events  they do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers  but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces  in describing a war or the subjugation of a people  a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man  but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event according to this view the power of historical personages  represented as the product of many forces  can no longer  it would seem  be regarded as a force that itself produces events  yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events  and treat it as their cause  in their exposition  an historic character is first the product of his time  and his power only the resultant of various forces  and then his power is itself a force producing events  gervinus  schlosser  and others  for instance  at one time prove napoleon to be a product of the revolution  of the ideas of  and so forth  and at another plainly say that the campaign of and other things they do not like were simply the product of napoleon s misdirected will  and that the very ideas of  were arrested in their development by napoleon s caprice  the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age produced napoleon s power  but napoleon s power suppressed the ideas of the revolution and the general temper of the age this curious contradiction is not accidental  not only does it occur at every step  but the universal historians  accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions  this contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway to find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force  the sum of the components must equal the resultant  this condition is never observed by the universal historians  and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit  in addition to the insufficient components  another unexplained force affecting the resultant action specialist historians describing the campaign of  or the restoration of the bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of alexander  but the universal historian gervinus  refuting this opinion of the specialist historian  tries to prove that the campaign of  and the restoration of the bourbons were due to other things beside alexander s will such as the activity of stein  metternich  madame de stael  talleyrand  fichte  chateaubriand  and others  the historian evidently decomposes alexander s power into the components  talleyrand chateaubriand  and the rest but the sum of the components  that is  the interactions of chateaubriand  talleyrand  madame de stael  and the others  evidently does not equal the resultant  namely the phenomenon of millions of frenchmen submitting to the bourbons  that chateaubriand madame de stael  and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions  and therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted that is  how component forces equal to one a gave a resultant equal to a thousand times a the historian is again obliged to fall back on power the force he had denied and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces  that is  he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant  and that is just what the universal historians do  and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves peasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain  say  according to whether they want rain or fine weather  the wind has blown the clouds away  or  the wind has brought up the clouds  and in the same way the universal historians sometimes  when it pleases them and fits in with their theory  say that power is the result of events  and sometimes when they want to prove something else  say that power produces events a third class of historians the so called historians of culture following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events again take that force to be something quite different  they see it in what is called culture in mental activity the historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors  the writers of universal histories  for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways  why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books  of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon  these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause  but despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity  only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples  and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people s actions  for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the french revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man  or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love but even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea history s essential question still remains unanswered  and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians  another  newer force the idea is added  the connection of which with the masses needs explanation  it is possible to understand that napoleon had power and so events occurred  with some effort one may even conceive that napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event  but how a book  le contrat social  had the effect of making frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event undoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements  just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce handicraft  gardening  or anything else you please  but why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand  only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion   that history is written by learned men  and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity  just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders  agriculturists  and soldiers if they do not express it  that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history  and  that spiritual activity  enlightenment civilization  culture  ideas  are all indistinct  indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning  and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory but not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind which may possibly even be of use to someone for something  the histories of culture  to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate  are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious  philosophic  and political doctrines as causes of events  as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of  for instance  they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power and say plainly that that was the result of napoleon s will  speaking so the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves  and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history  and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize chapter iii a locomotive is moving  someone asks  what moves it  a peasant says the devil moves it  another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round  a third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away the peasant is irrefutable  he has devised a complete explanation  to refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil  or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a german  who moves the locomotive  only then  as a result of the contradiction  will they see that they are both wrong  but the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself  for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round  and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler  he has no right to stop in his search for the cause  the man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation the only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed the only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples yet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds  all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed  some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes  as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive  others as a force resulting from several other forces  like the movement of the wheels  others again as an intellectual influence  like the smoke that is blown away so long as histories are written of separate individuals  whether caesars  alexanders  luthers  or voltaires  and not the histories of all  absolutely all those who take part in an event  it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end and the only such conception known to historians is that of power this conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history  as at present expounded  can be dealt with  and anyone who breaks that handle off  as buckle did  without finding some other method of treating historical material  merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it  the necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves  for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step in dealing with humanity s inquiry  the science of history up to now is like money in circulation paper money and coin  the biographies and special national histories are like paper money  they can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously  as long as no one asks what is the security behind them you need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events  and such histories as thiers  will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry  but just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because  being easy to make  too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold  so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires  by what force did napoleon do this that is  wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension the writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who  recognizing the defects of paper money  decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold  it may indeed make jingling coin  but will do no more than that  paper money may deceive the ignorant  but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle  as gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history s essential question  what is power  the universal historians give contradictory replies to that question  while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different  and as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold  or among those who do not know the nature of gold so universal historians and historians of culture  not answering humanity s essential question  serve as currency for some purposes of their own  only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call serious reading chapter iv having abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man s will to the deity  history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things  either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed power a return to the first is impossible  the belief has been destroyed  and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power napoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war  we are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when napoleon uttered certain words  seems to us senseless  he had the power and so what he ordered was done this reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by god  but as soon as we do not admit that  it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others it cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one a domination based on the application or threat of physical force  like the power of hercules  nor can it be based on the effect of moral force as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes  that is  men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius  this power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength  for  not to mention heroes such as napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely  history shows us that neither a louis xi nor a metternich  who ruled over millions of people  had any particular moral qualities  but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over if the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it  it must evidently be looked for elsewhere in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power and that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history s understanding of power for true gold power is the collective will of the people transferred  by expressed or tacit consent  to their chosen rulers in the domain of jurisprudence  which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged  it is all very clear  but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation the science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire namely  as something existing absolutely  but for history  the state and power are merely phenomena  just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon from this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence  it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power existing immutably outside time is  but to history s questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing if power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler  was pugachev a representative of the will of the people  if not then why was napoleon i  why was napoleon iii a criminal when he was taken prisoner at boulogne  and why  later on  were those criminals whom he arrested do palace revolutions in which sometimes only two or three people take part transfer the will of the people to a new ruler  in international relations  is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror  was the will of the confederation of the rhine transferred to napoleon in  was the will of the russian people transferred to napoleon in  when our army in alliance with the french went to fight the austrians to these questions three answers are possible either to assume  that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen  and that therefore every emergence of a new power  every struggle against the power once appointed  should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power  or  that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally  under definite and known conditions  and to show that all limitations  conflicts  and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them  or  that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally  but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite  and that the appearance of several authorities  their struggles and their falls  result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others and these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers some historians those biographical and specialist historians already referred to in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power  seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons  and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power  and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power mere violence their theory  suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history has the inconvenience in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another that a legitimist historian will prove that the national convention  the directory  and bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power  while a republican and a bonapartist will prove  the one that the convention and the other that the empire was the real power  and that all the others were violations of power  evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children recognizing the falsity of this view of history  another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers  and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them  but what this program consists in these historians do not say  or if they do they continually contradict one another each historian  according to his view of what constitutes a nation s progress  looks for these conditions in the greatness  wealth  freedom or enlightenment of citizens of france or some other country  but not to mention the historians  contradictions as to the nature of this program or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists the facts of history almost always contradict that theory  if the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth freedom  and enlightenment of the people  how is it that louis xiv and ivan the terrible end their reigns tranquilly  while louis xvi and charles i are executed by their people  to this question historians reply that louis xiv s activity  contrary to the program  reacted on louis xvi  but why did it not react on louis xiv or on louis xv why should it react just on louis xvi  and what is the time limit for such reactions  to these questions there are and can be no answers  equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs  and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the convention  to the directory  to napoleon  to alexander  to louis xviii to napoleon again  to charles x  to louis philippe  to a republican government  and to napoleon iii  when explaining these rapid transfers of the people s will from one individual to another  especially in view of international relations  conquests  and alliances  the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the people s will but are accidents dependent on cunning  on mistakes  on craft  or on the weakness of a diplomatist  a ruler  or a party leader  so that the greater part of the events of history civil wars  revolutions  and conquests are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the people s will  but as results of the ill directed will of one or more individuals  that is once again  as usurpations of power  and so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory these historians resemble a botanist who  having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons  should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves  and that the palm  the mushroom  and even the oak  which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves  are deviations from the theory historians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally  but that the conditions are unknown to us  they say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them but in that case  if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves  what significance have those leaders the leaders  these historians tell us  express the will of the people the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people but in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people s will or only some part of it  if the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people s will  as some historians suppose  then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a napoleon or a catherine serve to express the life of the nation  which is evident nonsense  but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people s life  as other so called philosophical  historians believe  then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation s life  we have first of all to know in what the nation s life consists met by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure  impalpable  and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences  and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity s movement  the most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are  freedom  equality  enlightenment  progress civilization  and culture  postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity  the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained  kings  ministers  generals authors  reformers  popes  and journalists  to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction but as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom  equality  enlightenment  or civilization  and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed  it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate  burn houses  abandon agriculture and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses  practice agriculture  or slay their fellow creatures history proves this at every turn  is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of louis xiv  xv  and xvi  their mistresses and ministers  and by the lives of napoleon  rousseau  diderot beaumarchais  and others is the movement of the russian people eastward to kazan and siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of ivan the terrible and by his correspondence with kurbski is the movement of the peoples at the time of the crusades explained by the life and activity of the godfreys and the louis es and their ladies for us that movement of the peoples from west to east  without leaders with a crowd of vagrants  and with peter the hermit  remains incomprehensible  and yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the crusade the deliverance of jerusalem had been clearly defined by historic leaders  popes kings  and knights incited the peoples to free the holy land  but the people did not go  for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed  the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples  and the history of the godfreys and the minnesingers has remained the history of godfreys and minnesingers  but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown still less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples the history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer  we learn that luther had a hot temper and said such and such things  we learn that rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books  but we do not learn why after the reformation the peoples massacred one another  nor why during the french revolution they guillotined one another if we unite both these kinds of history  as is done by the newest historians  we shall have the history of monarchs and writers  but not the history of the life of the peoples chapter v the life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men  for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found  the theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history the theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes  but in its application to history  as soon as revolutions  conquests  or civil wars occur that is  as soon as history begins that theory explains nothing the theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people s will cannot be verified  for it never occurred whatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs  the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him the replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who  watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field  or to the driving of the herdsman  should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head the herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader  this is what historians of the first class say those who assume the unconditional transference of the people s will if the animals leading the herd change  this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another  according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd  such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known  with this method of observation it often happens that the observer  influenced by the direction he himself prefers  regards those as leaders who  owing to the people s change of direction  are no longer in front  but on one side or even in the rear if the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered  this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention  and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd  so say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons  from monarchs to journalists  as the expression of their age the theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase a restatement of the question in other words what causes historical events  power  what is power  power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person  under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person  on condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people  that is  power is power  in other words  power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand if the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning then having subjected to criticism the explanation of power  that juridical science gives us  humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence  but to understand phenomena man has besides abstract reasoning  experience by which he verifies his reflections  and experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon not to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power  the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events whenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear  by whose will the event seems to have taken place  napoleon iii issues a decree and the french go to mexico  the king of prussia and bismarck issue decrees and an army enters bohemia  napoleon i issues a decree and an army enters russia  alexander i gives a command and the french submit to the bourbons  experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it the historians  in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs  want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power  but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience on the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man s will his words are only part of the general activity expressed in an event as for instance in a war or a revolution  and so without assuming an incomprehensible  supernatural force a miracle one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men  on the other hand  even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events  history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect  that is to say their commands are often not executed  and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs without admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard power  as the cause of events power  from the standpoint of experience  is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone s will and the execution of that will by others to explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will  referring it to man and not to the deity if the deity issues a command  expresses his will  as ancient history tells us  the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything  for the divinity is not controlled by an event  but speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another  to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore   the condition of all that takes place  the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands  and  the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command chapter vi only the expression of the will of the deity  not dependent on time  can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries  and only the deity  independent of everything  can by his sole will determine the direction of humanity s movement  but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs reinstating the first condition omitted  that of time  we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible no command ever appears spontaneously  or itself covers a whole series of occurrences  but each command follows from another  and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event when  for instance  we say that napoleon ordered armies to go to war  we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another  napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of russia and never did so  today he ordered such and such papers to be written to vienna  to berlin  and to petersburg  tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army  the fleet  the commissariat  and so on and so on millions of commands  which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the french armies into russia if throughout his reign napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of england and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into russia  with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance a conviction he repeatedly expressed this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case  but did so correspond in the latter for an order to be certainly executed  it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed  but to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible  not only in the case of napoleon s invasion of russia in which millions participated  but even in the simplest event for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution  every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted  all the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted  only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events  and are executed our false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed  we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be  apart from that  the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable  diverse  and petty events  such for instance as all those which led the french armies to russia  is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events  and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will we say that napoleon wished to invade russia and invaded it  in reality in all napoleon s activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish  but find a series of orders  or expressions of his will  very variously and indefinitely directed  amid a long series of unexecuted orders of napoleon s one series  for the campaign of was carried out not because those orders differed in any way from the other  unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the french army into russia  just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way  but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil so that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events  we find that a command can never be the cause of the event  but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two to understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the deity but from a man  which is  that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event this relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power  this relation consists in the following for common action people always unite in certain combinations  in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action  the relation between those taking part in it is always the same men uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share  and the smaller number a less direct share  in the collective action for which they have combined of all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army every army is composed of lower grades of the service the rank and file of whom there are always the greatest number  of the next higher military rank corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer  and of still higher officers of whom there are still fewer  and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person a military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone  of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army  and so on to the apex  the point of which will represent the commander in chief the soldiers  of whom there are the most  form the lower section of the cone and its base  the soldier himself does the stabbing  hacking burning  and pillaging  and always receives orders for these actions from men above him  he himself never gives an order  the noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer  perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers  but they already give commands  an officer still less often acts directly himself  but commands still more frequently  a general does nothing but command the troops  indicates the objective  and hardly ever uses a weapon himself  the commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself  but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops  a similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity in agriculture  trade  and every administration and so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army  or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest  we see a law by which men  to take associated action  combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are while the less their direct participation in the action itself  the more they command and the fewer of them there are  rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top  who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding this relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power having restored the condition of time under which all events occur  we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events  restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute  we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding chapter vii when an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it  and as the event results from the collective activity of many people  some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately  when one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled  that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it men are hauling a log  each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it  they haul the log away  and it happens that this is done as one of them said  he ordered it  there we have command and power in their primary form  the man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing  or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity  while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity when some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who  because their activity is given to directing and commanding  take less part in the direct work when a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity  justify his present activity  and guide him in planning his future actions  just the same is done by a concourse of people  allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations  justifications  and surmises concerning their collective activity for reasons known or unknown to us the french began to drown and kill one another  and corresponding to the event its justification appears in people s belief that this was necessary for the welfare of france  for liberty  and for equality  people ceased to kill one another  and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power  resistance to europe  and so on  men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men  and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of france  the baseness of england  and so on  history shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory  as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights  and the killing of millions in russia for the humiliation of england  but these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day these justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility  these temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front  they clear men s moral responsibilities from their path without such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event  how is it that millions of men commit collective crimes make war  commit murder  and so on with the present complex forms of political and social life in europe can any event that is not prescribed  decreed  or ordered by monarchs ministers  parliaments  or newspapers be imagined  is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity  in patriotism  in the balance of power  or in civilization  so that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and  receiving a justification  presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men in whatever direction a ship moves  the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it  to those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion only by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship  and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving we see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters that is  re establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs the continuity of movement in time  and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses when the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it  when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently  but wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement whatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed  wherever the ship may go  the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it  and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship s movement also examining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which  as commands  were related to events  historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands  but examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people  we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events  the incontestable proof of this deduction is that  however many commands were issued  the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it  but as soon as an event occurs be it what it may then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events arriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history  what is power  what force produces the movement of the nations  power is the relation of a given person to other individuals  in which the more this person expresses opinions  predictions  and justifications of the collective action that is performed  the less is his participation in that action  the movement of nations is caused not by power  nor by intellectual activity  nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed  but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events  and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa morally the wielder of power appears to cause the event  physically it is those who submit to the power  but as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical  the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two or in other words  the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining in the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity that final limit to which in every domain of thought man s reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject  electricity produces heat  heat produces electricity  atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another speaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms  we cannot say why this occurs  and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise  because it must be so and that it is a law  the same applies to historical events  why war and revolution occur we do not know  we only know that to produce the one or the other action people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part  and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise  or in other words that it is a law chapter viii if history dealt only with external phenomena  the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument  but the law of history relates to man  a particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue  but man  who is the subject of history says plainly  i am free and am therefore not subject to the law the presence of the problem of man s free will  though unexpressed  is felt at every step of history all seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question  all the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question if the will of every man were free  that is  if each man could act as he pleased  all history would be a series of disconnected incidents if in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely  that is  as he chose  it is evident that one single free act of that man s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity if there be a single law governing the actions of men  free will cannot exist  for then man s will is subject to that law in this contradiction lies the problem of free will  which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance the problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view theological  historical  ethical  or philosophic we find a general law of necessity to which he like all that exists  is subject  but regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of  we feel ourselves to be free this consciousness is a source of self cognition quite apart from and independent of reason  through his reason man observes himself  but only through consciousness does he know himself apart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable to understand  observe  and draw conclusions  man must first of all be conscious of himself as living  a man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills  that is  is conscious of his volition  but his will which forms the essence of his life man recognizes and can but recognize  as free if  observing himself  man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law whether he observes the necessity of taking food using his brain  or anything else  he cannot recognize this never varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it  were it not free it could not be limited  a man s will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free you say  i am not free  but i have lifted my hand and let it fall everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom that reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason if the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience  but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable a series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he  as an object of observation  is subject to certain laws  and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them  but the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible  and that his every action depends on his organization  his character  and the motives acting upon him  yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards  a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled but learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws  he does not and cannot believe this however often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before  yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way  he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases  every man  savage or sage  however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions  feels that without this irrational conception which constitutes the essence of freedom  he cannot imagine life  he feels that however impossible it may be  it is so  for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life  but he would be unable to live for a single moment he could not live  because all man s efforts  all his impulses to life are only efforts to increase freedom  wealth and poverty  fame and obscurity  power and subordination  strength and weakness  health and disease  culture and ignorance  work and leisure  repletion and hunger virtue and vice  are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom a man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life if the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time  or of an effect without a cause  that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason this unshakable  irrefutable consciousness of freedom  uncontrolled by experiment or argument  recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception  this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question man is the creation of an all powerful  all good  and all seeing god what is sin  the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man s freedom  that is a question for theology the actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics  what is man s responsibility to society  the conception of which results from the conception of freedom  that is a question for jurisprudence man s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him  what is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom  that is a question for ethics man in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life  but the same man apart from that connection appears to be free  how should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded as the result of the free  or as the result of the constrained  activity of man  that is a question for history only in our self confident day of the popularization of knowledge thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance  the diffusion of printed matter has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist  in our time the majority of so called advanced people that is  the crowd of ignoramuses have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem they say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist  for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves  the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes  they say this  not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers  but has never been denied  they do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it  for the fact that  from the point of view of observation  reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain  and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time  only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity  but it does not advance by a hair s breadth the solution of the question  which has another  opposite  side based on the consciousness of freedom if men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time  that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time in the first case the unknown quantity is the time  in the second case it is the origin  and the question of how man s consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology  for in a frog  a rabbit  or an ape  we can observe only the muscular nervous activity  but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity the naturalists and their followers  thinking they can solve this question  are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who  availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work  should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows  icons  woodwork  and still unbuttressed walls  and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers  everything is now so smooth and regular chapter ix for the solution of the question of free will or inevitability  history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with  that for history this question does not refer to the essence of man s free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions in regard to this question  history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science the subject for history is not man s will itself but our presentation of it and so for history  the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology  ethics  and philosophy  history surveys a presentation of man s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place in actual life each historic event  each human action  is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction  although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory to solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions  the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences  instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves  and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions  history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements whatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider  we always regard it as the result partly of man s free will and partly of the law of inevitability whether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians  or of the decrees of napoleon iii  or of someone s action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk  we are unconscious of any contradiction  the degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us our conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event  but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability  in every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability  and always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive  and the more inevitability the less freedom the proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded  but their relation is always one of inverse proportion a sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him  or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby  who steals some food  or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man seem less guilty  that is  less free and more subject to the law of necessity  to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed  and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning  that the mother was hungry  that the soldier was in the ranks and so on  similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability  to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed  and in the same way every action of an insane  intoxicated  or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action  and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it  in all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased  according to the point of view from which the action is regarded  so that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa religion  the common sense of mankind  the science of jurisprudence  and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom all cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations  the relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds  his relation to time  his relation to the causes leading to the action the first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man s relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him  this is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground  and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district  or of one bound by family  official  or business duties  seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion if we consider a man alone  apart from his relation to everything around him  each action of his seems to us free  but if we see his relation to anything around him  if we see his connection with anything whatever with a man who speaks to him  a book he reads  the work on which he is engaged  even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity  and the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases the second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man s action occupies in time  that is the ground which makes the fall of the first man  resulting in the production of the human race appear evidently less free than a man s entry into marriage today  it is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary  the consequences of which are still unknown to me the degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it if i examine an act i performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those i am in now  my action appears to me undoubtedly free  but if i examine an act performed a month ago  then being in different circumstances  i cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it good  agreeable  and even essential would not have taken place  if i reflect on an action still more remote  ten years ago or more  then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and i find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed  the farther i go back in memory  or what is the same thing the farther i go forward in my judgment  the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action in history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity  a contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants  but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible and the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear the austro prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of bismarck  and so on  the napoleonic wars still seem to us  though already questionably  to be the outcome of their heroes will  but in the crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of europe  though to the chroniclers of the crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people  in regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyone s head today to suppose that the renovation of the european world depended on attila s caprice  the farther back in history the object of our observation lies  the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability the third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason  in which each phenomenon comprehended  and therefore man s every action  must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow the better we are acquainted with the physiological  psychological  and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled and the more correctly we perceive the physiological  psychological  and historical causes of the action  and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question  the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear when we do not at all understand the cause of an action  whether a crime  a good action  or even one that is simply nonmoral  we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it  in the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act  in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly  in an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality  originality  and independence  but if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act  or the freedom of the apparently original action  that a criminal was reared among male factors mitigates his fault in our eyes  the self sacrifice of a father or mother  or self sacrifice with the possibility of a reward  is more comprehensible than gratuitous self sacrifice  and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will  the founder of a sect or party  or an inventor  impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity  if we have a large range of examples  if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people s actions  their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes  if we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation  our conception of their inevitability would be still greater  the dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father  the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company  a drunkard s relapse into drunkenness  and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause if the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development  like a child  a madman  or a simpleton then knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question  we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result on these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes  the responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged  and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation  and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action chapter x thus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world  the greater or lesser remoteness of time  and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man s life so that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known  where the time between the action and its examination is great  and where the causes of the action are most accessible  we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will  if we examine a man little dependent on external conditions  whose action was performed very recently  and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken  we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom in neither case however we may change our point of view  however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world  however inaccessible it may be to us  however long or short the period of time  however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity  to whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world  we never get a conception of freedom in space  every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body  i lift my arm and let it fall  my action seems to me free  but asking myself whether i could raise my arm in every direction  i see that i raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body  i chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles  for my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles  to conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space  which is evidently impossible  however much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed  we never get a conception of freedom in time  for if i examine an action committed a second ago i must still recognize it as not being free  for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed  can i lift my arm  i lift it  but ask myself  could i have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed  to convince myself of this i do not lift it the next moment  but i am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when i asked the question  time has gone by which i could not detain  the arm i then lifted is no longer the same as the arm i now refrain from lifting  nor is the air in which i lifted it the same that now surrounds me  the moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable  and at that moment i could make only one movement  and whatever movement i made would be the only one  that i did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that i could have abstained from lifting it then  and since i could make only one movement at that single moment of time  it could not have been any other  to imagine it as free  it is necessary to imagine it in the present  on the boundary between the past and the future that is  outside time  which is impossible  however much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased  we never reach a conception of complete freedom  that is  an absence of cause  however inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action  our own or another s  the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause  for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable  i raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause  but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action but even if imagining a man quite exempt from all influences  examining only his momentary action in the present  unevoked by any cause we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero  we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man  for a being uninfluenced by the external world  standing outside of time and independent of cause  is no longer a man in the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability  however we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated  that knowledge can never be complete  for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space  and therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains  however we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it  that period will be finite  while time is infinite  and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability  however accessible may be the chain of causation of any action  we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless  and so again we never reach absolute inevitability but besides this  even if  admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero  we assumed in some given case as for instance in that of a dying man  an unborn babe  or an idiot complete absence of freedom  by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining  for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man  and so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man s completely free action and so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom  we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations  an infinitely long period of time and an infinite series of causes to imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability  we must imagine him all alone  beyond space  beyond time and free from dependence on cause in the first case  if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself  that is  a mere form without content in the second case  if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space  time  and cause  which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing  or mere content without form we should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man s whole outlook on the universe is constructed the incomprehensible essence of life  and the laws defining that essence reason says   space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite  and cannot be imagined otherwise   time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise  the connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end consciousness says   i alone am  and all that exists is but me consequently i include space   i measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone i am conscious of myself as living consequently i am outside time   i am beyond cause  for i feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life reason gives expression to the laws of inevitability  consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom freedom not limited by anything is the essence of life  in man s consciousness  inevitability without content is man s reason in its three forms freedom is the thing examined  inevitability is what examines  freedom is the content  inevitability is the form only by separating the two sources of cognition  related to one another as form to content  do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability only by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man s life apart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content  no conception of life is possible all that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability  that is  of consciousness to the laws of reason all that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability  or of the essence of life to the laws of reason the great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them  we call those forces gravitation  inertia  electricity  animal force  and so on  but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom but just as the force of gravitation  incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man  is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight  up to newton s law  so too the force of free will  incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious  is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject from the fact that every man dies up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws all knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason man s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it  but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force  the forces of gravitation  electricity  or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason  just so the force of man s free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it  freedom  apart from necessity  that is apart from the laws of reason that define it  differs in no way from gravitation  or heat  or the force that makes things grow  for reason it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life and as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity  or of chemical affinity  or of the vital force  forms the content of astronomy  physics  chemistry  botany  zoology  and so on  just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history  but just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics  even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space  in time  and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history  while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics in the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability  what is unknown to us we call vital force  vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life so also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability what is unknown we call free will  free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life chapter xi history examines the manifestations of man s free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause  that is  it defines this freedom by the laws of reason  and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws the recognition of man s free will as something capable of influencing historical events  that is  as not subject to laws  is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy that assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws that is  of any science whatever  if there is even a single body moving freely  then the laws of kepler and newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists  if any single action is due to free will  then not a single historical law can exist  nor any conception of historical events for history  lines exist of the movement of human wills  one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man s will in the present moves in space  time  and dependence on cause the more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes  the more evident are the laws of that movement  to discover and define those laws is the problem of history from the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows  seeking the causes of events in man s freewill  a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible for however man s free will may be restricted  as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law  the existence of law becomes impossible only by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal  that is  by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity  can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes  and then instead of seeking causes  history will take the discovery of laws as its problem the search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self destruction toward which ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena the old method of history is moving all human sciences have traveled along that path  arriving at infinitesimals  mathematics  the most exact of sciences  abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown  infinitely small  quantities  abandoning the conception of cause  mathematics seeks law  that is  the property common to all unknown  infinitely small  elements in another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded  when newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction  he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another  that is  leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies  he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small  the same is done by the natural sciences  leaving aside the question of cause  they seek for laws  history stands on the same path  and if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals  it too  setting aside the conception of cause  should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will chapter xii from the time the law of copernicus was discovered and proved  the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients  by disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies  but without disproving it  it would seem impossible to continue studying the ptolemaic worlds  but even after the discovery of the law of copernicus the ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time from the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws  and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions  and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples  the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence by refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained  but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of man s free will  for if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic ethnographic  or economic conditions  then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause and yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics  geography  political economy  comparative philology and geology  which directly contradict its assumptions the struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy  theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation  but when truth conquered  theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation just as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history  and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view  and accuses the new view of subverting revelation in the one case as in the other  on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth  on the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages  on the other is the passion for destruction to the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in god  in the creation of the firmament  and in the miracle of joshua the son of nun  to the defenders of the laws of copernicus and newton  to voltaire for example  it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion  and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion just so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability  to destroy the conception of the soul  of good and evil and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions so too  like voltaire in his time  uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion  though the law of inevitability in history  like the law of copernicus in astronomy  far from destroying  even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected as in the question of astronomy then  so in the question of history now the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute  serving as the measure of visible phenomena  in astronomy it was the immovability of the earth  in history it is the independence of personality free will as with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth s fixity and of the motion of the planets  so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space  time  and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one s own personality  but as in astronomy the new view said  it is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth  but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity  while by admitting its motion which we do not feel  we arrive at laws  so also in history the new view says  it is true that we are not conscious of our dependence  but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity  while by admitting our dependence on the external world  on time  and on cause  we arrive at laws in the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel  in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist  and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious end of the project gutenberg ebook of war and peace  by leo tolstoy

april  language  english  start of this project gutenberg ebook pamela  or virtue rewarded produced by tapio riikonen and david widger pamela or virtue rewarded by samuel richardson publishers  note samuel richardson  the first  in order of time  of the great english novelists  was born in  and died at london in  he was a printer by trade  and rose to be master of the stationers  company  that he also became a novelist was due to his skill as a letter writer  which brought him  in his fiftieth year  a commission to write a volume of model familiar letters  as an aid to persons too illiterate to compose their own  the notion of connecting these letters by a story which had interested him suggested the plot of pamela  and determined its epistolary form a form which was retained in his later works this novel published  created an epoch in the history of english fiction  and  with its successors  exerted a wide influence upon continental literature  it is appropriately included in a series which is designed to form a group of studies of english life by the masters of english fiction  for it marked the transition from the novel of adventure to the novel of character from the narration of entertaining events to the study of men and of manners  of motives and of sentiments in it the romantic interest of the story which is of the slightest  is subordinated to the moral interest in the conduct of its characters in the various situations in which they are placed  upon this aspect of the drama of human life  richardson cast a most observant  if not always a penetrating glance  his works are an almost microscopically detailed picture of english domestic life in the early part of the eighteenth century pamela  or virtue rewarded letter i dear father and mother i have great trouble  and some comfort  to acquaint you with  the trouble is  that my good lady died of the illness i mentioned to you and left us all much grieved for the loss of her  for she was a dear good lady  and kind to all us her servants  much i feared  that as i was taken by her ladyship to wait upon her person  i should be quite destitute again  and forced to return to you and my poor mother  who have enough to do to maintain yourselves  and  as my lady s goodness had put me to write and cast accounts  and made me a little expert at my needle  and otherwise qualified above my degree  it was not every family that could have found a place that your poor pamela was fit for  but god  whose graciousness to us we have so often experienced at a pinch put it into my good lady s heart  on her death bed  just an hour before she expired  to recommend to my young master all her servants  one by one  and when it came to my turn to be recommended  for i was sobbing and crying at her pillow  she could only say  my dear son and so broke off a little  and then recovering remember my poor pamela and these were some of her last words  o how my eyes run don t wonder to see the paper so blotted well  but god s will must be done and so comes the comfort  that i shall not be obliged to return back to be a clog upon my dear parents for my master said  i will take care of you all  my good maidens  and for you  pamela  and took me by the hand  yes  he took my hand before them all  for my dear mother s sake  i will be a friend to you  and you shall take care of my linen  god bless him  and pray with me  my dear father and mother  for a blessing upon him  for he has given mourning and a year s wages to all my lady s servants  and i having no wages as yet  my lady having said she should do for me as i deserved  ordered the housekeeper to give me mourning with the rest  and gave me with his own hand four golden guineas  and some silver  which were in my old lady s pocket when she died  and said  if i was a good girl  and faithful and diligent  he would be a friend to me  for his mother s sake  and so i send you these four guineas for your comfort  for providence will not let me want  and so you may pay some old debt with part  and keep the other part to comfort you both  if i get more  i am sure it is my duty and it shall be my care  to love and cherish you both  for you have loved and cherished me  when i could do nothing for myself  i send them by john  our footman  who goes your way  but he does not know what he carries  because i seal them up in one of the little pill boxes  which my lady had  wrapt close in paper  that they mayn t chink  and be sure don t open it before him i know  dear father and mother  i must give you both grief and pleasure and so i will only say  pray for your pamela  who will ever be your most dutiful daughter i have been scared out of my senses  for just now  as i was folding up this letter in my late lady s dressing room  in comes my young master good sirs  how was i frightened  i went to hide the letter in my bosom and he  seeing me tremble  said  smiling  to whom have you been writing pamela i said  in my confusion  pray your honour forgive me only to my father and mother  he said  well then  let me see how you are come on in your writing  o how ashamed i was he took it  without saying more and read it quite through  and then gave it me again and i said  pray your honour forgive me yet i know not for what  for he was always dutiful to his parents  and why should he be angry that i was so to mine  and indeed he was not angry  for he took me by the hand  and said you are a good girl  pamela  to be kind to your aged father and mother i am not angry with you for writing such innocent matters as these though you ought to be wary what tales you send out of a family be faithful and diligent  and do as you should do  and i like you the better for this  and then he said  why  pamela  you write a very pretty hand  and spell tolerably too  i see my good mother s care in your learning has not been thrown away upon you  she used to say you loved reading  you may look into any of her books  to improve yourself  so you take care of them  to be sure i did nothing but courtesy and cry and was all in confusion  at his goodness  indeed he is the best of gentlemen  i think  but i am making another long letter  so will only add to it  that i shall ever be your dutiful daughter  pamela andrews letter ii in answer to the preceding dear pamela your letter was indeed a great trouble  and some comfort  to me and your poor mother  we are troubled  to be sure  for your good lady s death who took such care of you  and gave you learning  and  for three or four years past  has always been giving you clothes and linen  and every thing that a gentlewoman need not be ashamed to appear in  but our chief trouble is  and indeed a very great one  for fear you should be brought to anything dishonest or wicked  by being set so above yourself  every body talks how you have come on  and what a genteel girl you are  and some say you are very pretty  and  indeed  six months since  when i saw you last  i should have thought so myself  if you was not our child  but what avails all this  if you are to be ruined and undone indeed  my dear pamela  we begin to be in great fear for you  for what signify all the riches in the world  with a bad conscience  and to be dishonest  we are  tis true  very poor  and find it hard enough to live  though once as you know  it was better with us  but we would sooner live upon the water  and  if possible  the clay of the ditches i contentedly dig  than live better at the price of our child s ruin i hope the good squire has no design  but when he has given you so much money  and speaks so kindly to you  and praises your coming on  and  oh that fatal word  that he would be kind to you  if you would do as you should do  almost kills us with fears i have spoken to good old widow mumford about it  who  you know  has formerly lived in good families  and she puts us in some comfort  for she says it is not unusual  when a lady dies  to give what she has about her person to her waiting maid  and to such as sit up with her in her illness  but  then  why should he smile so kindly upon you  why should he take such a poor girl as you by the hand  as your letter says he has done twice  why should he stoop to read your letter to us  and commend your writing and spelling  and why should he give you leave to read his mother s books indeed  indeed  my dearest child  our hearts ache for you  and then you seem so full of joy at his goodness  so taken with his kind expressions  which  truly  are very great favours  if he means well  that we fear yes  my dear child  we fear you should be too grateful and reward him with that jewel  your virtue  which no riches nor favour  nor any thing in this life  can make up to you i  too  have written a long letter  but will say one thing more  and that is  that  in the midst of our poverty and misfortunes  we have trusted in god s goodness  and been honest  and doubt not to be happy hereafter  if we continue to be good  though our lot is hard here  but the loss of our dear child s virtue would be a grief that we could not bear  and would bring our grey hairs to the grave at once if  then  you love us  if you wish for god s blessing  and your own future happiness  we both charge you to stand upon your guard  and if you find the least attempt made upon your virtue  be sure you leave every thing behind you  and come away to us  for we had rather see you all covered with rags  and even follow you to the churchyard  than have it said  a child of ours preferred any worldly conveniences to her virtue we accept kindly your dutiful present  but  till we are out of pain cannot make use of it  for fear we should partake of the price of our poor daughter s shame  so have laid it up in a rag among the thatch over the window  for a while  lest we should be robbed  with our blessings  and our hearty prayers for you  we remain             your careful  but loving father and mother                                       john and elizabeth andrews letter iii dear father i must needs say  your letter has filled me with trouble  for it has made my heart  which was overflowing with gratitude for my master s goodness  suspicious and fearful  and yet i hope i shall never find him to act unworthy of his character  for what could he get by ruining such a poor young creature as me  but that which gives me most trouble is that you seem to mistrust the honesty of your child  no  my dear father and mother  be assured  that  by god s grace  i never will do any thing that shall bring your grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  i will die a thousand deaths  rather than be dishonest any way  of that be assured and set your hearts at rest  for although i have lived above myself for some time past  yet i can be content with rags and poverty  and bread and water  and will embrace them  rather than forfeit my good name let who will be the tempter  and of this pray rest satisfied  and think better of your dutiful daughter till death my master continues to be very affable to me  as yet i see no cause to fear any thing  mrs  jervis  the housekeeper  too  is very civil to me  and i have the love of every body  sure they can t all have designs against me  because they are civil  i hope i shall always behave so as to be respected by every one  and that nobody would do me more hurt than i am sure i would do them  our john so often goes your way  that i will always get him to call  that you may hear from me  either by writing for it brings my hand in  or by word of mouth letter iv dear mother for the last was to my father  in answer to his letter  and so i will now write to you  though i have nothing to say  but what will make me look more like a vain hussy  than any thing else  however  i hope i shan t be so proud as to forget myself  yet there is a secret pleasure one has to hear one s self praised  you must know  then  that my lady davers  who  i need not tell you  is my master s sister  has been a month at our house  and has taken great notice of me  and given me good advice to keep myself to myself  she told me i was a pretty wench  and that every body gave me a very good character  and loved me  and bid me take care to keep the fellows at a distance  and said  that i might do and be more valued for it  even by themselves but what pleased me much was  what i am going to tell you  for at table as mrs  jervis says  my master and her ladyship talking of me  she told him she thought me the prettiest wench she ever saw in her life  and that i was too pretty to live in a bachelor s house  since no lady he might marry would care to continue me with her  he said  i was vastly improved  and had a good share of prudence  and sense above my years  and that it would be pity  that what was my merit should be my misfortune no  says my good lady  pamela shall come and live with me i think  he said  with all his heart  he should be glad to have me so well provided for  well  said she  i ll consult my lord about it  she asked how old i was  and mrs  jervis said  i was fifteen last february o  says she  if the wench for so she calls all us maiden servants takes care of herself  she ll improve yet more and more  as well in her person as mind now  my dear father and mother  though this may look too vain to be repeated by me  yet are you not rejoiced  as well as i  to see my master so willing to part with me this shews that he has nothing bad in his heart  but john is just going away  and so i have only to say  that i am  and will always be                          your honest as well as dutiful daughter pray make use of the money  you may now do it safely letter v my dear father and mother john being to go your way  i am willing to write  because he is so willing to carry any thing for me  he says it does him good at his heart to see you both  and to hear you talk  he says you are both so sensible and so honest  that he always learns something from you to the purpose it is a thousand pities  he says  that such worthy hearts should not have better luck in the world  and wonders  that you  my father  who are so well able to teach  and write so good a hand  succeeded no better in the school you attempted to set up  but was forced to go to such hard labour  but this is more pride to me  that i am come of such honest parents  than if i had been born a lady i hear nothing yet of going to lady davers  and i am very easy at present here  for mrs  jervis uses me as if i were her own daughter and is a very good woman  and makes my master s interest her own  she is always giving me good counsel  and i love her next to you two  i think best of any body  she keeps so good rule and order  she is mightily respected by us all  and takes delight to hear me read to her  and all she loves to hear read  is good books  which we read whenever we are alone  so that i think i am at home with you  she heard one of our men harry  who is no better than he should be  speak freely to me  i think he called me his pretty pamela  and took hold of me  as if he would have kissed me  for which  you may be sure  i was very angry  and she took him to task  and was as angry at him as could be  and told me she was very well pleased to see my prudence and modesty  and that i kept all the fellows at a distance  and indeed i am sure i am not proud  and carry it civilly to every body  but yet  methinks  i cannot bear to be looked upon by these men servants  for they seem as if they would look one through  and  as i generally breakfast  dine  and sup  with mrs jervis  so good she is to me  i am very easy that i have so little to say to them  not but they are civil to me in the main  for mrs  jervis s sake  who they see loves me  and they stand in awe of her  knowing her to be a gentlewoman born  though she has had misfortunes  i am going on again with a long letter  for i love writing  and shall tire you  but when i began  i only intended to say  that i am quite fearless of any danger now  and  indeed  cannot but wonder at myself  though your caution to me was your watchful love  that i should be so foolish as to be so uneasy as i have been  for i am sure my master would not demean himself  so as to think upon such a poor girl as i  for my harm  for such a thing would ruin his credit  as well as mine  you know  who  to be sure  may expect one of the best ladies in the land  so no more at present  but that i am                                            your ever dutiful daughter letter vi dear father and mother my master has been very kind since my last  for he has given me a suit of my late lady s clothes  and half a dozen of her shifts  and six fine handkerchiefs  and three of her cambric aprons  and four holland ones the clothes are fine silk  and too rich and too good for me  to be sure i wish it was no affront to him to make money of them  and send it to you  it would do me more good you will be full of fears  i warrant now  of some design upon me  till i tell you  that he was with mrs  jervis when he gave them me  and he gave her a mort of good things  at the same time  and bid her wear them in remembrance of her good friend  my lady  his mother  and when he gave me these fine things  he said  these  pamela  are for you  have them made fit for you  when your mourning is laid by  and wear them for your good mistress s sake  mrs  jervis gives you a very good word  and i would have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto  and every body will be your friend i was so surprised at his goodness  that i could not tell what to say i courtesied to him  and to mrs  jervis for her good word  and said  i wished i might be deserving of his favour  and her kindness  and nothing should be wanting in me  to the best of my knowledge o how amiable a thing is doing good it is all i envy great folks for i always thought my young master a fine gentleman  as every body says he is  but he gave these good things to us both with such a graciousness as i thought he looked like an angel mrs  jervis says  he asked her  if i kept the men at a distance  for  he said  i was very pretty  and to be drawn in to have any of them  might be my ruin  and make me poor and miserable betimes  she never is wanting to give me a good word  and took occasion to launch out in my praise she says  but i hope she has said no more than i shall try to deserve though i mayn t at present  i am sure i will always love her  next to you and my dear mother  so i rest                                     your ever dutiful daughter letter vii dear father since my last  my master gave me more fine things  he called me up to my late lady s closet  and  pulling out her drawers  he gave me two suits of fine flanders laced headclothes  three pair of fine silk shoes  two hardly the worse  and just fit for me  for my lady had a very little foot  and the other with wrought silver buckles in them  and several ribands and top knots of all colours  four pair of white fine cotton stockings  and three pair of fine silk ones  and two pair of rich stays i was quite astonished  and unable to speak for a while  but yet i was inwardly ashamed to take the stockings  for mrs  jervis was not there if she had  it would have been nothing  i believe i received them very awkwardly  for he smiled at my awkwardness  and said  don t blush pamela  dost think i don t know pretty maids should wear shoes and stockings i was so confounded at these words  you might have beat me down with a feather  for you must think  there was no answer to be made to this  so like a fool  i was ready to cry  and went away courtesying and blushing i am sure  up to the ears  for  though there was no harm in what he said  yet i did not know how to take it  but i went and told all to mrs jervis  who said  god put it into his heart to be good to me  and i must double my diligence  it looked to her  she said  as if he would fit me in dress for a waiting maid s place on lady davers s own person but still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head  and made all these gifts nothing near to me what they would have been  but yet  i hope  there is no reason  for what good could it do to him to harm such a simple maiden as me  besides  to be sure no lady would look upon him  if he should so disgrace himself  so i will make myself easy  and indeed  i should never have been otherwise  if you had not put it into my head  for my good  i know very well  but  may be  without these uneasinesses to mingle with these benefits  i might be too much puffed up  so i will conclude  all that happens is for our good  and god bless you  my dear father and mother  and i know you constantly pray for a blessing upon me  who am  and shall always be                                     your dutiful daughter letter viii dear pamela i cannot but renew my cautions on your master s kindness  and his free expression to you about the stockings  yet there may not be  and i hope there is not  any thing in it  but when i reflect  that there possibly may  and that if there should  no less depends upon it than my child s everlasting happiness in this world and the next  it is enough to make one fearful for you  arm yourself  my dear child  for the worst  and resolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue  what though the doubts i filled you with  lessen the pleasure you would have had in your master s kindness  yet what signify the delights that arise from a few paltry fine clothes  in comparison with a good conscience these are  indeed  very great favours that he heaps upon you  but so much the more to be suspected  and when you say he looked so amiably and like an angel  how afraid i am  that they should make too great an impression upon you  for  though you are blessed with sense and prudence above your years  yet i tremble to think  what a sad hazard a poor maiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the temptations of this world  and a designing young gentleman  if he should prove so  who has so much power to oblige  and has a kind of authority to command  as your master i charge you  my dear child  on both our blessings  poor as we are  to be on your guard  there can be no harm in that  and since mrs  jervis is so good a gentlewoman  and so kind to you  i am the easier a great deal and so is your mother  and we hope you will hide nothing from her  and take her counsel in every thing  so  with our blessings  and assured prayers for you  more than for ourselves  we remain your loving father and mother be sure don t let people s telling you  you are pretty  puff you up  for you did not make yourself  and so can have no praise due to you for it  it is virtue and goodness only  that make the true beauty  remember that  pamela letter ix dear father and mother i am sorry to write you word  that the hopes i had of going to wait on lady davers  are quite over  my lady would have had me  but my master as i heard by the by  would not consent to it  he said her nephew might be taken with me  and i might draw him in  or be drawn in by him  and he thought  as his mother loved me  and committed me to his care  he ought to continue me with him  and mrs  jervis would be a mother to me  mrs jervis tells me the lady shook her head  and said  ah  brother  and that was all  and as you have made me fearful by your cautions  my heart at times misgives me  but i say nothing yet of your caution  or my own uneasiness  to mrs  jervis  not that i mistrust her  but for fear she should think me presumptuous  and vain and conceited  to have any fears about the matter  from the great distance between such a gentleman  and so poor a girl  but yet mrs  jervis seemed to build something upon lady davers s shaking her head  and saying  ah  brother  and no more  god  i hope  will give me his grace  and so i will not  if i can help it  make myself too uneasy  for i hope there is no occasion  but every little matter that happens  i will acquaint you with  that you may continue to me your good advice  and pray for                                your sad hearted pamela letter x dear mother you and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in so many weeks  but a sad  sad scene  has been the occasion of it  for to be sure  now it is too plain  that all your cautions were well grounded o my dear mother  i am miserable  truly miserable but yet  don t be frightened  i am honest god  of his goodness  keep me so o this angel of a master  this fine gentleman  this gracious benefactor to your poor pamela  who was to take care of me at the prayer of his good dying mother  who was so apprehensive for me  lest i should be drawn in by lord davers s nephew  that he would not let me go to lady davers s  this very gentleman yes  i must call him gentleman  though he has fallen from the merit of that title  has degraded himself to offer freedoms to his poor servant  he has now shewed himself in his true colours  and  to me  nothing appear so black  and so frightful i have not been idle  but had writ from time to time  how he  by sly mean degrees  exposed his wicked views  but somebody stole my letter and i know not what has become of it  it was a very long one  i fear  he that was mean enough to do bad things  in one respect  did not stick at this  but be it as it will  all the use he can make of it will be  that he may be ashamed of his part  i not of mine  for he will see i was resolved to be virtuous  and gloried in the honesty of my poor parents i will tell you all  the next opportunity  for i am watched very narrowly  and he says to mrs  jervis  this girl is always scribbling i think she may be better employed  and yet i work all hours with my needle  upon his linen  and the fine linen of the family  and am besides  about flowering him a waistcoat but  oh  my heart s broke almost  for what am i likely to have for my reward  but shame and disgrace  or else ill words  and hard treatment  i ll tell you all soon and hope i shall find my long letter                                        your most afflicted daughter may be  i he and him too much  but it is his own fault if i do  for why did he lose all his dignity with me letter xi dear mother well  i can t find my letter  and so i ll try to recollect it all  and be as brief as i can  all went well enough in the main for some time after my letter but one  at last  i saw some reason to suspect  for he would look upon me  whenever he saw me  in such a manner  as shewed not well  and one day he came to me  as i was in the summer house in the little garden  at work with my needle  and mrs  jervis was just gone from me  and i would have gone out  but he said  no don t go  pamela i have something to say to you  and you always fly me when i come near you  as if you were afraid of me i was much out of countenance  you may well think  but said  at last  it does not become your good servant to stay in your presence  sir  without your business required it  and i hope i shall always know my place well  says he  my business does require it sometimes  and i have a mind you should stay to hear what i have to say to you i stood still confounded  and began to tremble  and the more when he took me by the hand  for now no soul was near us my sister davers  said he  and seemed  i thought  to be as much at a loss for words as i  would have had you live with her  but she would not do for you what i am resolved to do  if you continue faithful and obliging  what say st thou  my girl  said he  with some eagerness had st thou not rather stay with me  than go to my sister davers  he looked so  as filled me with affrightment  i don t know how  wildly  i thought i said  when i could speak  your honour will forgive me  but as you have no lady for me to wait upon  and my good lady has been now dead this twelvemonth  i had rather  if it would not displease you  wait upon lady davers  because i was proceeding  and he said  a little hastily because you are a little fool  and know not what s good for yourself  i tell you i will make a gentlewoman of you  if you be obliging  and don t stand in your own light  and so saying  he put his arm about me  and kissed me now  you will say  all his wickedness appeared plainly  i struggled and trembled  and was so benumbed with terror  that i sunk down  not in a fit  and yet not myself  and i found myself in his arms  quite void of strength  and he kissed me two or three times  with frightful eagerness at last i burst from him  and was getting out of the summer house  but he held me back  and shut the door i would have given my life for a farthing  and he said  i ll do you no harm  pamela  don t be afraid of me  i said  i won t stay  you won t hussy  said he  do you know whom you speak to  i lost all fear  and all respect  and said  yes  i do  sir  too well well may i forget that i am your servant  when you forget what belongs to a master i sobbed and cried most sadly  what a foolish hussy you are  said he have i done you any harm  yes  sir  said i  the greatest harm in the world  you have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me and have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us  by demeaning yourself  to be so free to a poor servant  yet  sir  i will be bold to say  i am honest  though poor  and if you was a prince  i would not be otherwise he was angry  and said  who would have you otherwise  you foolish slut cease your blubbering  i own i have demeaned myself  but it was only to try you  if you can keep this matter secret  you ll give me the better opinion of your prudence  and here s something  said he  putting some gold in my hand  to make you amends for the fright i put you in  go take a walk in the garden  and don t go in till your blubbering is over and i charge you say nothing of what is past  and all shall be well  and i ll forgive you i won t take the money  indeed  sir  said i  poor as i am i won t take it  for  to say truth  i thought it looked like taking earnest  and so i put it upon the bench  and as he seemed vexed and confused at what he had done  i took the opportunity to open the door  and went out of the summer house he called to me  and said  be secret  i charge you  pamela  and don t go in yet  as i told you o how poor and mean must those actions be  and how little must they make the best of gentlemen look  when they offer such things as are unworthy of themselves  and put it into the power of their inferiors to be greater than they i took a turn or two in the garden  but in sight of the house  for fear of the worst  and breathed upon my hand to dry my eyes  because i would not be too disobedient  my next shall tell you more pray for me  my dear father and mother  and don t be angry i have not yet run away from this house  so late my comfort and delight  but now my terror and anguish  i am forced to break off hastily                                  your dutiful and honest daughter letter xii dear mother well  i will now proceed with my sad story  and so  after i had dried my eyes  i went in  and began to ruminate with myself what i had best to do  sometimes i thought i would leave the house and go to the next town  and wait an opportunity to get to you  but then i was at a loss to resolve whether to take away the things he had given me or no  and how to take them away  sometimes i thought to leave them behind me  and only go with the clothes on my back  but then i had two miles and a half and a byway  to the town  and being pretty well dressed  i might come to some harm  almost as bad as what i would run away from  and then may be thought i  it will be reported  i have stolen something  and so was forced to run away  and to carry a bad name back with me to my dear parents  would be a sad thing indeed o how i wished for my grey russet again  and my poor honest dress  with which you fitted me out  and hard enough too it was for you to do it  for going to this place  when i was not twelve years old  in my good lady s days  sometimes i thought of telling mrs  jervis  and taking her advice  and only feared his command to be secret  for  thought i  he may be ashamed of his actions  and never attempt the like again  and as poor mrs  jervis depended upon him through misfortunes  that had attended her  i thought it would be a sad thing to bring his displeasure upon her for my sake in this quandary  now considering  now crying  and not knowing what to do  i passed the time in my chamber till evening  when desiring to be excused going to supper  mrs  jervis came up to me  and said  why must i sup without you  pamela  come  i see you are troubled at something  tell me what is the matter i begged i might be permitted to be with her on nights  for i was afraid of spirits  and they would not hurt such a good person as she  that was a silly excuse  she said  for why was not you afraid of spirits before indeed i did not think of that  but you shall be my bed fellow with all my heart  added she  let your reason be what it will  only come down to supper  i begged to be excused  for  said i i have been crying so  that it will be taken notice of by my fellow servants  and i will hide nothing from you  mrs  jervis  when we are alone she was so good to indulge me  but made haste to come up to bed  and told the servants  that i should be with her  because she could not rest well  and would get me to read her to sleep  for she knew i loved reading  she said when we were alone  i told her all that had passed  for i thought though he had bid me not  yet if he should come to know i had told  it would be no worse  for to keep a secret of such a nature  would be  as i apprehended  to deprive myself of the good advice which i never wanted more  and might encourage him to think i did not resent it as i ought and would keep worse secrets  and so make him do worse by me  was i right  my dear mother mrs  jervis could not help mingling tears with my tears  for i cried all the time i was telling her the story  and begged her to advise me what to do  and i shewed her my dear father s two letters  and she praised the honesty and editing of them  and said pleasing things to me of you both  but she begged i would not think of leaving my service  for said she  in all likelihood  you behaved so virtuously  that he will be ashamed of what he has done  and never offer the like to you again though  my dear pamela  said she  i fear more for your prettiness than for anything else  because the best man in the land might love you so she was pleased to say  she wished it was in her power to live independent  then she would take a little private house  and i should live with her like her daughter and so  as you ordered me to take her advice  i resolved to tarry to see how things went  except he was to turn me away  although  in your first letter  you ordered me to come away the moment i had any reason to be apprehensive  so  dear father and mother  it is not disobedience  i hope  that i stay  for i could not expect a blessing  or the good fruits of your prayers for me  if i was disobedient all the next day i was very sad  and began my long letter  he saw me writing  and said as i mentioned  to mrs  jervis  that girl is always scribbling  methinks she might find something else to do  or to that purpose  and when i had finished my letter  i put it under the toilet in my late lady s dressing room  whither nobody comes but myself and mrs jervis  besides my master  but when i came up again to seal it  to my great concern  it was gone  and mrs  jervis knew nothing of it  and nobody knew of my master s having been near the place in the time  so i have been sadly troubled about it  but mrs  jervis  as well as i  thinks he has it  some how or other  and he appears cross and angry  and seems to shun me  as much as he said i did him  it had better be so than worse but he has ordered mrs  jervis to bid me not pass so much time in writing  which is a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take notice of  as i am not idle other ways  if he did not resent what he thought i wrote upon  and this has no very good look but i am a good deal easier since i lie with mrs  jervis  though  after all  the fears i live in on one side  and his frowning and displeasure at what i do on the other  make me more miserable than enough o that i had never left my little bed in the loft  to be thus exposed to temptations on one hand  or disgusts on the other  how happy was i awhile ago  how contrary now pity and pray for                                          your afflicted                                                   pamela letter xiii my dearest child our hearts bleed for your distress  and the temptations you are exposed to  you have our hourly prayers  and we would have you flee this evil great house and man  if you find he renews his attempts  you ought to have done it at first  had you not had mrs  jervis to advise with  we can find no fault in your conduct hitherto  but it makes our hearts ache for fear of the worst  o my child  temptations are sore things but yet  without them  we know not ourselves  nor what we are able to do your danger is very great  for you have riches  youth  and a fine gentleman  as the world reckons him  to withstand  but how great will be your honour to withstand them  and when we consider your past conduct and your virtuous education  and that you have been bred to be more ashamed of dishonesty than poverty  we trust in god  that he will enable you to overcome  yet  as we can t see but your life must be a burthen to you  through the great apprehensions always upon you  and that it may be presumptuous to trust too much to our own strength  and that you are but very young  and the devil may put it into his heart to use some stratagem  of which great men are full  to decoy you  i think you had better come home to share our poverty with safety  than live with so much discontent in a plenty  that itself may be dangerous  god direct you for the best  while you have mrs  jervis for an adviser and bed fellow  and  o my dear child  that was prudently done of you we are easier than we should be  and so committing you to the divine protection  remain                             your truly loving  but careful                                                      father and mother letter xiv dear father and mother mrs  jervis and i have lived very comfortably together for this fortnight past  for my master was all that time at his lincolnshire estate  and at his sister s  the lady davers  but he came home yesterday  he had some talk with mrs  jervis soon after  and mostly about me  he said to her  it seems  well  mrs  jervis  i know pamela has your good word  but do you think her of any use in the family  she told me she was surprised at the question  but said  that i was one of the most virtuous and industrious young creatures that ever she knew  why that word virtuous  said he  i pray you  was there any reason to suppose her otherwise  or has any body taken it into his head to try her i wonder  sir  says she  you ask such a question  who dare offer any thing to her in such an orderly and well governed house as yours  and under a master of so good a character for virtue and honour  your servant  mrs jervis  says he  for your good opinion  but pray  if any body did  do you think pamela would let you know it  why  sir  said she  she is a poor innocent young creature  and i believe has so much confidence in me  that she would take my advice as soon as she would her mother s innocent  again  and virtuous  i warrant  well  mrs  jervis  you abound with your epithets  but i take her to be an artful young baggage  and had i a young handsome butler or steward  she d soon make her market of one of them  if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a husband alack a day  sir  said she  it is early days with pamela  and she does not yet think of a husband  i dare say  and your steward and butler are both men in years  and think nothing of the matter  no  said he  if they were younger  they d have more wit than to think of such a girl  i ll tell you my mind of her  mrs  jervis  i don t think this same favourite of yours so very artless a girl as you imagine  i am not to dispute with your honour  said mrs  jervis  but i dare say  if the men will let her alone  she ll never trouble herself about them  why  mrs  jervis  said he  are there any men that will not let her alone  that you know of no  indeed  sir  said she  she keeps herself so much to herself  and yet behaves so prudently  that they all esteem her  and shew her as great a respect as if she was a gentlewoman born ay  says he  that s her art  that i was speaking of  but  let me tell you  the girl has vanity and conceit  and pride too  or i am mistaken and  perhaps  i could give you an instance of it  sir  said she  you can see farther than such a poor silly woman as i am  but i never saw any thing but innocence in her and virtue too  i ll warrant ye  said he but suppose i could give you an instance  where she has talked a little too freely of the kindnesses that have been shewn her from a certain quarter  and has had the vanity to impute a few kind words  uttered in mere compassion to her youth and circumstances  into a design upon her and even dared to make free with names that she ought never to mention but with reverence and gratitude  what would you say to that say  sir said she  i cannot tell what to say  but i hope pamela incapable of such ingratitude well  no more of this silly girl  says he  you may only advise her as you are her friend  not to give herself too much licence upon the favours she meets with  and if she stays here  that she will not write the affairs of my family purely for an exercise to her pen  and her invention  i tell you she is a subtle  artful gipsy  and time will shew it you was ever the like heard  my dear father and mother  it is plain he did not expect to meet with such a repulse  and mistrusts that i have told mrs  jervis  and has my long letter too  that i intended for you  and so is vexed to the heart  but i can t help it  i had better be thought artful and subtle  than be so  in his sense  and  as light as he makes of the words virtue and innocence in me  he would have made a less angry construction  had i less deserved that he should do so  for then  may be  my crime should have been my virtue with him naughty gentleman as he is i will soon write again  but must now end with saying  that i am  and shall always be  your honest daughter letter xv dear mother i broke off abruptly my last letter  for i feared he was coming  and so it happened  i put the letter in my bosom  and took up my work  which lay by me  but i had so little of the artful  as he called it  that i looked as confused as if i had been doing some great harm sit still  pamela  said he  mind your work  for all me you don t tell me i am welcome home  after my journey to lincolnshire  it would be hard  sir  said i  if you was not always welcome to your honour s own house i would have gone  but he said  don t run away  i tell you  i have a word or two to say to you  good sirs  how my heart went pit a pat when i was a little kind to you  said he  in the summer house  and you carried yourself so foolishly upon it  as if i had intended to do you great harm  did i not tell you you should take no notice of what passed to any creature  and yet you have made a common talk of the matter  not considering either my reputation  or your own i made a common talk of it  sir  said i  i have nobody to talk to  hardly he interrupted me  and said  hardly  you little equivocator  what do you mean by hardly  let me ask you  have not you told mrs  jervis for one pray your honour  said i  all in agitation  let me go down  for it is not for me to hold an argument with your honour  equivocator  again said he  and took my hand  what do you talk of an argument  is it holding an argument with me to answer a plain question  answer me what i asked  o  good sir  said i  let me beg you will not urge me farther  for fear i forget myself again  and be saucy answer me then  i bid you  says he  have you not told mrs  jervis  it will be saucy in you if you don t answer me directly to what i ask  sir said i  and fain would have pulled my hand away  perhaps i should be for answering you by another question  and that would not become me  what is it you would say  replies he  speak out then  sir  said i  why should your honour be so angry i should tell mrs jervis  or any body else  what passed  if you intended no harm well said  pretty innocent and artless  as mrs  jervis calls you  said he  and is it thus you taunt and retort upon me  insolent as you are but still i will be answered directly to my question  why then  sir said i  i will not tell a lie for the world  i did tell mrs  jervis  for my heart was almost broken  but i opened not my mouth to any other  very well  boldface  said he  and equivocator again  you did not open your mouth to any other  but did not you write to some other  why  now  and please your honour  said i  for i was quite courageous just then  you could not have asked me this question  if you had not taken from me my letter to my father and mother  in which i own i had broken my mind freely to them  and asked their advice  and poured forth my griefs and so i am to be exposed  am i  said he  in my own house  and out of my house  to the whole world  by such a sauce box as you  no  good sir said i  and i hope your honour won t be angry with me  it is not i that expose you  if i say nothing but the truth  so  taunting again assurance as you are  said he  i will not be thus talked to pray  sir  said i  of whom can a poor girl take advice  if it must not be of her father and mother  and such a good woman as mrs  jervis  who for her sex sake  should give it me when asked  insolence  said he  and stamped with his foot  am i to be questioned thus by such a one as you i fell down on my knees  and said  for heaven s sake  your honour  pity a poor creature  that knows nothing of her duty  but how to cherish her virtue and good name  i have nothing else to trust to  and  though poor and friendless here  yet i have always been taught to value honesty above my life  here s ado with your honesty  said he  foolish girl  is it not one part of honesty to be dutiful and grateful to your master  do you think  indeed  sir  said i  it is impossible i should be ungrateful to your honour  or disobedient  or deserve the names of bold face or insolent  which you call me  but when your commands are contrary to that first duty which shall ever be the principle of my life he seemed to be moved  and rose up  and walked into the great chamber two or three turns  leaving me on my knees  and i threw my apron over my face  and laid my head on a chair  and cried as if my heart would break having no power to stir at last he came in again  but  alas  with mischief in his heart  and raising me up  he said  rise  pamela  rise  you are your own enemy  your perverse folly will be your ruin  i tell you this  that i am very much displeased with the freedoms you have taken with my name to my housekeeper  as also to your father and mother  and you may as well have real cause to take these freedoms with me  as to make my name suffer for imaginary ones  and saying so  he offered to take me on his knee  with some force  o how i was terrified  i said  like as i had read in a book a night or two before  angels and saints  and all the host of heaven defend me  and may i never survive one moment that fatal one in which i shall forfeit my innocence  pretty fool  said he  how will you forfeit your innocence  if you are obliged to yield to a force you cannot withstand  be easy  said he  for let the worst happen that can  you will have the merit  and i the blame  and it will be a good subject for letters to your father and mother  and a tale into the bargain for mrs jervis he by force kissed my neck and lips  and said  whoever blamed lucretia all the shame lay on the ravisher only and i am content to take all the blame upon me  as i have already borne too great a share for what i have not deserved may i  said i  lucretia like  justify myself with my death  if i am used barbarously  o my good girl  said he  tauntingly  you are well read i see  and we shall make out between us  before we have done  a pretty story in romance  i warrant ye he then put his hand in my bosom  and indignation gave me double strength  and i got loose from him by a sudden spring  and ran out of the room  and the next chamber being open  i made shift to get into it and threw to the door  and it locked after me  but he followed me so close  he got hold of my gown  and tore a piece off  which hung without the door  for the key was on the inside i just remember i got into the room  for i knew nothing further of the matter till afterwards  for i fell into a fit with my terror  and there i lay  till he  as i suppose  looking through the key hole  spyed me upon the floor  stretched out at length  on my face  and then he called mrs  jervis to me  who  by his assistance  bursting open the door  he went away  seeing me coming to myself  and bid her say nothing of the matter  if she was wise poor mrs  jervis thought it was worse  and cried over me like as if she was my mother  and i was two hours before i came to myself  and just as i got a little up on my feet  he coming in  i fainted away again with the terror  and so he withdrew  but he staid in the next room to let nobody come near us  that his foul proceedings might not be known mrs  jervis gave me her smelling bottle  and had cut my laces  and set me in a great chair  and he called her to him  how is the girl  said he i never saw such a fool in my life  i did nothing at all to her  mrs jervis could not speak for crying  so he said  she has told you  it seems  that i was kind to her in the summer house  though i ll assure you  i was quite innocent then as well as now  and i desire you to keep this matter to yourself  and let me not be named in it o  sir  said she  for your honour s sake  and for christ s sake but he would not hear her  and said for your own sake  i tell you  mrs jervis  say not a word more  i have done her no harm  and i won t have her stay in my house  prating  perverse fool  as she is  but since she is so apt to fall into fits  or at least pretend to do so  prepare her to see me to morrow after dinner  in my mother s closet  and do you be with her  and you shall hear what passes between us and so he went out in a pet  and ordered his chariot and four to be got ready  and went a visiting somewhere mrs  jervis then came to me  and i told her all that had happened  and said  i was resolved not to stay in the house  and she replying  he seemed to threaten as much  i said  i am glad of that  then i shall be easy  so she told me all he had said to her  as above mrs  jervis is very loath i should go  and yet  poor woman  she begins to be afraid for herself  but would not have me ruined for the world she says to be sure he means no good  but may be  now he sees me so resolute  he will give over all attempts  and that i shall better know what to do after tomorrow  when i am to appear before a very bad judge i doubt o how i dread this to morrow s appearance  but be as assured  my dear parents  of the honesty of your poor child  as i am of your prayers for                                         your dutiful daughter o this frightful to morrow  how i dread it letter xvi my dear parents i know you longed to hear from me soon  and i send you as soon as i could well  you may believe how uneasily i passed the time  till his appointed hour came  every minute  as it grew nearer  my terrors increased  and sometimes i had great courage  and sometimes none at all  and i thought i should faint when it came to the time my master had dined  i could neither eat nor drink  for my part  and do what i could  my eyes were swelled with crying at last he went up to the closet  which was my good lady s dressing room  a room i once loved  but then as much hated don t your heart ache for me i am sure mine fluttered about like a new caught bird in a cage  o pamela  said i to myself  why art thou so foolish and fearful  thou hast done no harm  what  if thou fearest an unjust judge  when thou art innocent  would st thou do before a just one  if thou wert guilty  have courage  pamela  thou knowest the worst and how easy a choice poverty and honesty is  rather than plenty and wickedness so i cheered myself  but yet my poor heart sunk  and my spirits were quite broken  everything that stirred  i thought was to call me to my account  i dreaded it  and yet i wished it to come well  at last he rung the bell  o  thought i  that it was my passing bell  mrs  jervis went up  with a full heart enough  poor good woman  he said  where s pamela  let her come up  and do you come with her  she came to me  i was ready to go with my feet  but my heart was with my dear father and mother  wishing to share your poverty and happiness  i went up  however o how can wicked men seem so steady and untouched with such black hearts  while poor innocents stand like malefactors before them he looked so stern  that my heart failed me  and i wished myself any where but there  though i had before been summoning up all my courage good heaven  said i to myself  give me courage to stand before this naughty master  o soften him  or harden me come in  fool  said he  angrily  as soon as he saw me  and snatched my hand with a pull  you may well be ashamed to see me  after your noise and nonsense  and exposing me as you have done  i ashamed to see you thought i  very pretty indeed but i said nothing mrs  jervis  said he  here you are both together  do you sit down  but let her stand  if she will  ay  thought i  if i can  for my knees beat one against the other  did you not think  when you saw the girl in the way you found her in  that i had given her the greatest occasion for complaint  that could possibly be given to a woman  and that i had actually ruined her  as she calls it  tell me  could you think any thing less  indeed  said she  i feared so at first  has she told you what i did to her  and all i did to her  to occasion all this folly  by which my reputation might have suffered in your opinion  and in that of all the family inform me  what she has told you she was a little too much frightened  as she owned afterwards  at his sternness  and said  indeed she told me you only pulled her on your knee  and kissed her then i plucked up my spirits a little  only  mrs  jervis  said i  and was not that enough to shew me what i had to fear  when a master of his honour s degree demeans himself to be so free as that to such a poor servant as me  what is the next to be expected but your honour went farther  so you did  and threatened me what you would do  and talked of lucretia  and her hard fate your honour knows you went too far for a master to a servant  or even to his equal  and i cannot bear it  so i fell a crying most sadly mrs  jervis began to excuse me  and to beg he would pity a poor maiden that had such a value for her reputation  he said  i speak it to her face  i think her very pretty  and i thought her humble  and one that would not grow upon my favours  or the notice i took of her  but i abhor the thoughts of forcing her to any thing  i know myself better  said he and what belongs to me  and to be sure i have enough demeaned myself to take notice of such a one as she  but i was bewitched by her  i think to be freer than became me  though i had no intention to carry the jest farther what poor stuff was all this  my dear mother  from a man of his sense but see how a bad cause and bad actions confound the greatest wits it gave me a little more courage then  for innocence  i find  in a low fortune  and weak mind  has many advantages over guilt  with all its riches and wisdom so i said  your honour may call this jest or sport  or what you please but indeed  sir  it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a master and a servant  do you hear  mrs  jervis  said he  do you hear the pertness of the creature  i had a good deal of this sort before in the summer house  and yesterday too  which made me rougher with her than perhaps i had otherwise been says mrs  jervis  pamela  don t be so pert to his honour  you should know your distance  you see his honour was only in jest o dear mrs jervis  said i  don t you blame me too  it is very difficult to keep one s distance to the greatest of men  when they won t keep it themselves to their meanest servants see again  said he  could you believe this of the young baggage  if you had not heard it  good your honour  said the well meaning gentlewoman pity and forgive the poor girl  she is but a girl  and her virtue is very dear to her  and i will pawn my life for her  she will never be pert to your honour  if you ll be so good as to molest her no more  nor frighten her again  you saw  sir  by her fit  she was in terror  she could not help it  and though your honour intended her no harm  yet the apprehension was almost death to her  and i had much ado to bring her to herself again  o the little hypocrite  said he  she has all the arts of her sex  they were born with her  and i told you awhile ago you did not know her  but this was not the reason principally of my calling you before me together  i find i am likely to suffer in my reputation by the perverseness and folly of this girl  she has told you all  and perhaps more than all  nay  i make no doubt of it  and she has written letters for i find she is a mighty letter writer  to her father and mother and others  as far as i know  in which representing herself as an angel of light  she makes her kind master and benefactor  a devil incarnate o how people will sometimes  thought i  call themselves by their right names and all this  added he  i won t hear  and so i am resolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken from  and let her be careful how she uses my name with freedom  when she is gone from me i was brightened up at once with these welcome words  and i threw myself upon my knees at his feet  with a most sincere glad heart  and i said may your honour be for ever blessed for your resolution  now i shall be happy  and permit me  on my bended knees  to thank you for all the benefits and favours you have heaped upon me  for the opportunities i have had of improvement and learning  through my good lady s means  and yours  i will now forget all your honour has offered me  and i promise you  that i will never let your name pass my lips  but with reverence and gratitude  and so god almighty bless your honour  for ever and ever amen then rising from my knees  i went away with another guise sort of heart than i came into his presence with  and so i fell to writing this letter  and thus all is happily over and now  my dearest father and mother  expect to see soon your poor daughter  with an humble and dutiful mind  returned to you  and don t fear but i know how to be as happy with you as ever  for i will be in the loft  as i used to do  and pray let my little bed be got ready  and i have a small matter of money  which will buy me a suit of clothes fitter for my condition than what i have  and i will get mrs  mumford to help me to some needle work  and fear not that i shall be a burden to you  if my health continues  i know i shall be blessed  if not for my own sake  for both your sakes  who have  in all your trials and misfortunes  preserved so much integrity as makes every body speak well of you both  but i hope he will let good mrs  jervis give me a character  for fear it should be thought that i was turned away for dishonesty and so  my dear parents  may you be blest for me  and i for you  and i will always pray for my master and mrs  jervis  so good night  for it is late  and i shall be soon called to bed i hope mrs  jervis is not angry with me  she has not called me to supper  though i could eat nothing if she had  but i make no doubt i shall sleep purely to night  and dream that i am with you  in my dear dear  happy loft once more so good night again  my dear father and mother  says                                           your poor honest daughter perhaps i mayn t come this week  because i must get up the linen  and leave in order every thing belonging to my place  so send me a line  if you can  to let me know if i shall be welcome  by john  who will call for it as he returns  but say nothing of my coming away to him  as yet for it will be said i blab every thing letter xvii my dearest daughter welcome  welcome  ten times welcome shall you be to us  for you come to us innocent  and happy  and honest  and you are the staff of our old age  and our comfort  and though we cannot do for you as we would  yet fear not  we shall live happily together  and what with my diligent labour  and your poor mother s spinning  and your needle work  i make no doubt we shall do better and better  only your poor mother s eyes begin to fail her  though  i bless god  i am as strong and able  and willing to labour as ever  and  o my dear child  your virtue has made me  i think  stronger and better than i was before  what blessed things are trials and temptations  when we have the strength to resist and subdue them but i am uneasy about those same four guineas  i think you should give them back again to your master  and yet i have broken them  alas  i have only three left  but i will borrow the fourth  if i can  part upon my wages  and part of mrs  mumford  and send the whole sum back to you that you may return it  against john comes next  if he comes again before you i want to know how you come  i fancy honest john will be glad to bear you company part of the way  if your master is not so cross as to forbid him  and if i know time enough  your mother will go one five miles  and i will go ten on the way  or till i meet you  as far as one holiday will go  for that i can get leave to make on such an occasion and we shall receive you with more pleasure than we had at your birth when all the worst was over  or than we ever had in our lives and so god bless you till the happy time comes  say both your mother and i  which is all at present  from                                your truly loving parents letter xviii dear father and mother i thank you a thousand tines for your goodness to me  expressed in your last letter  i now long to get my business done  and come to my new old lot again  as i may call it  i have been quite another thing since my master has turned me off  and as i shall come to you an honest daughter what pleasure it is to what i should have had  if i could not have seen you but as a guilty one  well  my writing time will soon be over  and so i will make use of it now  and tell you all that has happened since my last letter i wondered mrs  jervis did not call me to sup with her  and feared she was angry  and when i had finished my letter  i longed for her coming to bed  at last she came up  but seemed shy and reserved  and i said my dear mrs  jervis  i am glad to see you  you are not angry with me  i hope  she said she was sorry things had gone so far  and that she had a great deal of talk with my master  after i was gone  that he seemed moved at what i said  and at my falling on my knees to him  and my prayer for him  at my going away  he said i was a strange girl  he knew not what to make of me  and is she gone  said he  i intended to say something else to her  but she behaved so oddly  that i had not power to stop her  she asked  if she should call me again  he said  yes  and then  no  let her go  it is best for her and me too  and she shall go now i have given her warning  where she had it  i can t tell  but i never met with the fellow of her in any life  at any age  she said he had ordered her not to tell me all  but she believed he would never offer any thing to me again  and i might stay  she fancied  if i would beg it as a favour  though she was not sure neither i stay  dear mrs  jervis  said i  why it is the best news that could have come to me  that he will let me go  i do nothing but long to go back again to my poverty and distress  as he threatened i should  for though i am sure of the poverty  i shall not have half the distress i have had for some months past  i ll assure you mrs  jervis  dear good soul  wept over me  and said  well  well  pamela i did not think i had shewn so little love to you  as that you should express so much joy upon leaving me  i am sure i never had a child half so dear to me as you are i went to hear her so good to me  as indeed she has always been  and said  what would you have me to do  dear mrs  jervis  i love you next to my own father and mother  and to leave you is the chief concern i have at quitting this place  but i am sure it is certain ruin if i stay after such offers  and such threatenings  and his comparing himself to a wicked ravisher in the very time of his last offer  and turning it into a jest  that we should make a pretty story in a romance  can i stay and be safe  has he not demeaned himself twice  and it behoves me to beware of the third time  for fear he should lay his snares surer  for perhaps he did not expect a poor servant would resist her master so much  and must it not be looked upon as a sort of warrant for such actions  if i stay after this  for  i think  when one of our sex finds she is attempted  it is an encouragement to the attempter to proceed  if one puts one s self in the way of it  when one can help it  tis neither more nor less than inviting him to think that one forgives  what  in short  ought not to be forgiven  which is no small countenance to foul actions  i ll assure you she hugged me to her  and said i ll assure you  pretty face  where gottest thou all thy knowledge  and thy good notions  at these years thou art a miracle for thy age  and i shall always love thee but  do you resolve to leave us  pamela yes  my dear mrs  jervis  said i  for  as matters stand  how can i do otherwise but i ll finish the duties of my place first  if i may  and hope you ll give me a character  as to my honesty  that it may not be thought i was turned away for any harm  ay  that i will  said she  i will give thee such a character as never girl at thy years deserved  and i am sure  said i  i will always love and honour you  as my third best friend  wherever i go  or whatever becomes of me and so we went to bed  and i never waked till twas time to rise which i did as blithe as a bird  and went about my business with great pleasure but i believe my master is fearfully angry with me  for he passed by me two or three times  and would not speak to me  and towards evening  he met me in the passage  going into the garden  and said such a word to me as i never heard in my life from him to man  woman  or child  for he first said  this creature s always in the way  i think  i said  standing up as close as i could  and the entry was wide enough for a coach too i hope i shan t be long in your honour s way  d mn you  said he  that was the hard word  for a little witch  i have no patience with you i profess i trembled to hear him say so  but i saw he was vexed  and as i am going away  i minded it the less  well  i see  my dear parents that when a person will do wicked things  it is no wonder he will speak wicked words  may god keep me out of the way of them both                                             your dutiful daughter letter xix dear father and mother our john having an opportunity to go your way  i write again  and send both letters at once  i can t say  yet  when i shall get away  nor how i shall come  because mrs  jervis shewed my master the waistcoat i am flowering for him  and he said  it looks well enough  i think the creature had best stay till she has finished it there is some private talk carried on betwixt him and mrs  jervis that she don t tell me of  but yet she is very kind to me  and i don t mistrust her at all  i should be very base if i did  but to be sure she must oblige him  and keep all his lawful commands  and other  i dare say  she won t keep  she is too good  and loves me too well  but she must stay when i am gone  and so must get no ill will she has been at me again to ask to stay  and humble myself  but what have i done  mrs  jervis  said i  if i have been a sauce box  and a bold face  and a pert  and a creature  as he calls me  have i not had reason  do you think i should ever have forgot myself  if he had not forgot to act as my master  tell me from your own heart  dear mrs jervis  said i  if you think i could stay and be safe  what would you think  or how would you act in my case my dear pamela  said she  and kissed me  i don t know how i should act or what i should think  i hope i should act as you do  but i know nobody else that would  my master is a fine gentleman  he has a great deal of wit and sense  and is admired  as i know  by half a dozen ladies  who would think themselves happy in his addresses  he has a noble estate and yet i believe he loves my good maiden  though his servant  better than all the ladies in the land  and he has tried to overcome it because you are so much his inferior  and tis my opinion he finds he can t  and that vexes his proud heart  and makes him resolve you shan t stay  and so he speaks so cross to you  when he sees you by accident well  but  mrs  jervis  said i  let me ask you  if he can stoop to like such a poor girl as me  as perhaps he may  for i have read of things almost as strange  from great men to poor damsels  what can it be for he may condescend  perhaps  to think i may be good enough for his harlot  and those things don t disgrace men that ruin poor women  as the world goes  and so if i was wicked enough  he would keep me till i was undone  and till his mind changed  for even wicked men  i have read soon grow weary of wickedness with the same person  and love variety well  then  poor pamela must be turned off  and looked upon as a vile abandoned creature  and every body would despise her  ay  and justly too  mrs  jervis  for she that can t keep her virtue  ought to live in disgrace but  mrs  jervis  i continued  let me tell you  that i hope  if i was sure he would always be kind to me  and never turn me off at all  that i shall have so much grace  as to hate and withstand his temptations  were he not only my master  but my king  and that for the sin s sake  this my poor dear parents have always taught me  and i should be a sad wicked creature indeed  if  for the sake of riches or favour  i should forfeit my good name  yea  and worse than any other young body of my sex because i can so contentedly return to my poverty again  and think it a less disgrace to be obliged to wear rags  and live upon rye bread and water  as i used to do  than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the world mrs  jervis lifted up her hands  and had her eyes full of tears god bless you  my dear love  said she  you are my admiration and delight how shall i do to part with you well  good mrs  jervis  said i  let me ask you now you and he have had some talk  and you mayn t be suffered to tell me all  but  do you think if i was to ask to stay  that he is sorry for what he has done  ay  and ashamed of it too  for i am sure he ought  considering his high degree and my low degree  and how i have nothing in the world to trust to but my honesty  do you think in your own conscience now  pray answer me truly  that he would never offer any thing to me again  and that i could be safe alas  my dear child  said she  don t put thy home questions to me  with that pretty becoming earnestness in thy look  i know this  that he is vexed at what he has done  he was vexed the first time  more vexed the second time yes  said i  and so he will be vexed  i suppose  the third  and the fourth time too  till he has quite ruined your poor maiden  and who will have cause to be vexed then nay  pamela  said she  don t imagine that i would be accessory to your ruin for the world  i only can say  that he has  yet  done you no hurt and it is no wonder he should love you  you are so pretty  though so much beneath him but  i dare swear for him  he never will offer you any force you say  said i  that he was sorry for his first offer in the summer house  well  and how long did his sorrow last only till he found me by myself  and then he was worse than before  and so became sorry again  and if he has deigned to love me  and you say can t help it  why  he can t help it neither  if he should have an opportunity a third time to distress me  and i have read that many a man has been ashamed of his wicked attempts  when he has been repulsed  that would never have been ashamed of them  had he succeeded  besides  mrs  jervis if he really intends to offer no force  what does that mean while you say he can t help liking me  for love it cannot be does it not imply that he hopes to ruin me by my own consent  i think  said i  and hope i should have grace to do so  that i should not give way to his temptations on any account  but it would be very presumptuous in me to rely upon my own strength against a gentleman of his qualifications and estate  and who is my master  and thinks himself entitled to call me bold face  and what not  only for standing on my necessary defence  and that  too  where the good of my soul and body  and my duty to god  and my parents  are all concerned  how then  mrs  jervis  said i  can i ask or wish to stay well  well  says she  as he seems very desirous you should not stay  i hope it is from a good motive  for fear he should be tempted to disgrace himself as well as you  no  no  mrs  jervis  said i  i have thought of that too  for i would be glad to consider him with that duty that becomes me  but then he would have let me go to lady davers  and not have hindered my preferment  and he would not have said  i should return to my poverty and distress  when  by his mother s goodness  i had been lifted out of it  but that he intended to fright me  and punish me  as he thought  for not complying with his wickedness  and this shews me well enough what i have to expect from his future goodness  except i will deserve it at his own dear price she was silent  and i added  well  there s no more to be said  i must go  that s certain  all my concern will be how to part with you  and indeed  after you  with every body  for all my fellow servants have loved me  and you and they will cost me a sigh  and a tear too  now and then  i am sure  and so i fell a crying  i could not help it  for it is a pleasant thing to one to be in a house among a great many fellow servants  and be beloved by them all nay  i should have told you before now  how kind and civil mr  longman our steward is  vastly courteous  indeed  on all occasions  and he said once to mrs  jervis  he wished he was a young man for my sake  i should be his wife  and he would settle all he had upon me on marriage  and you must know  he is reckoned worth a power of money i take no pride in this  but bless god  and your good examples  my dear parents  that i have been enabled so to carry myself  as to have every body s good word  not but our cook one day  who is a little snappish and cross sometimes  said once to me  why this pamela of ours goes as fine as a lady  see what it is to have a fine face i wonder what the girl will come to at last she was hot with her work  and i sneaked away  for i seldom go down into the kitchen  and i heard the butler say  why  jane  nobody has your good word  what has mrs  pamela done to you  i am sure she offends nobody and what  said the peevish wench  have i said to her  foolatum  but that she was pretty  they quarrelled afterwards  i heard  i was sorry for it but troubled myself no more about it  forgive this silly prattle  from                                             your dutiful daughter oh  i forgot to say  that i would stay to finish the waistcoat  if i might with safety  mrs  jervis tells me i certainly may  i never did a prettier piece of work  and i am up early and late to get it over  for i long to be with you letter xx dear father and mother i did not send my last letters so soon as i hoped  because john whether my master mistrusts or no  i can t say  had been sent to lady davers s instead of isaac  who used to go  and i could not be so free with  nor so well trust isaac  though he is very civil to me too  so i was forced to stay till john returned as i may not have opportunity to send again soon  and yet  as i know you keep my letters  and read them over and over  so john told me  when you have done work  so much does your kindness make you love all that comes from your poor daughter  and as it may be some little pleasure to me  perhaps  to read them myself  when i am come to you  to remind me of what i have gone through  and how great god s goodness has been to me which  i hope  will further strengthen my good resolutions  that i may not hereafter  from my bad conduct  have reason to condemn myself from my own hand as it were  for all these reasons  i say  i will write as i have time  and as matters happen  and send the scribble to you as i have opportunity  and if i don t every time  in form  subscribe as i ought i am sure you will always believe  that it is not for want of duty  so i will begin where i left off  about the talk between mrs  jervis and me for me to ask to stay unknown to mrs  jervis  i put a project  as i may call it  in practice i thought with myself some days ago  here i shall go home to my poor father and mother  and have nothing on my back  that will be fit for my condition  for how should your poor daughter look with a silk night gown  silken petticoats  cambric head clothes  fine holland linen laced shoes that were my lady s  and fine stockings  and how in a little while must these have looked  like old cast offs  indeed  and i looked so for wearing them  and people would have said  for poor folks are envious as well as rich  see there goody andrews s daughter  turned home from her fine place  what a tawdry figure she makes  and how well that garb becomes her poor parents  circumstances and how would they look upon me  thought i to myself  when they should come to be threadbare and worn out  and how should i look  even if i could purchase homespun clothes  to dwindle into them one by one  as i got them may be  an old silk gown  and a linsey woolsey petticoat  and the like  so thought i  i had better get myself at once equipped in the dress that will become my condition  and though it may look but poor to what i have been used to wear of late days  yet it will serve me  when i am with you  for a good holiday and sunday suit  and what  by a blessing on my industry  i may  perhaps  make shift to keep up to so  as i was saying  unknown to any body  i bought of farmer nichols s wife and daughters a good sad coloured stuff  of their own spinning enough to make me a gown and two petticoats  and i made robings and facings of a pretty bit of printed calico i had by me i had a pretty good camblet quilted coat  that i thought might do tolerably well  and i bought two flannel undercoats  not so good as my swanskin and fine linen ones  but what will keep me warm  if any neighbour should get me to go out to help em to milk  now and then  as sometimes i used to do formerly  for i am resolved to do all your good neighbours what kindness i can  and hope to make myself as much beloved about you  as i am here i got some pretty good scotch cloth  and made me  of mornings and nights  when nobody saw me  two shifts  and i have enough left for two shirts  and two shifts  for you my dear father and mother  when i come home  i ll make them for you  and desire your acceptance then i bought of a pedlar  two pretty enough round eared caps  a little straw hat  and a pair of knit mittens  turned up with white calico  and two pair of ordinary blue worsted hose  that make a smartish appearance with white clocks  i ll assure you  and two yards of black riband for my shift sleeves  and to serve as a necklace  and when i had em all come home  i went and looked upon them once in two hours  for two days together  for  you must know  though i be with mrs  jervis  i keep my own little apartment still for my clothes  and nobody goes thither but myself  you ll say i was no bad housewife to have saved so much money but my dear good lady was always giving me something i believed myself the more obliged to do this  because  as i was turned away for what my good master thought want of duty  and as he expected other returns for his presents  than i intended to make him  so i thought it was but just to leave his presents behind me when i went away  for  you know  if i would not earn his wages  why should i have them don t trouble yourself about the four guineas  nor borrow to make them up  for they were given me  with some silver  as i told you  as a perquisite  being what my lady had about her when she died  and  as i hope for no wages  i am so vain as to think i have deserved all that money in the fourteen months  since my lady s death  for she  good soul overpaid me before  in learning and other kindnesses  had she lived none of these things might have happened but i ought to be thankful tis no worse  every thing will turn about for the best  that s my confidence so  as i was saying  i have provided a new and more suitable dress  and i long to appear in it  more than ever i did in any new clothes in my life  for then i shall be soon after with you  and at ease in my mind but  mum  here he comes  i believe i am  etc letter xxi my dear father and mother i was forced to break off  for i feared my master was coming  but it proved to be only mrs  jervis  she said  i can t endure you should be so much by yourself  pamela  and i  said i  dread nothing so much as company  for my heart was up at my mouth now  for fear my master was coming  but i always rejoice to see dear mrs  jervis said she  i have had a world of talk with my master about you  i am sorry for it  said i  that i am made of so much consequence as to be talked of by him  o  said she  i must not tell you all  but you are of more consequence to him than you think for or wish for  said i  for the fruits of being of consequence to him would make me of none to myself  or any body else said she  thou art as witty as any lady in the land  i wonder where thou gottest it  but they must be poor ladies  with such great opportunities i am sure  if they have no more wit than i but let that pass i suppose  said i  that i am of so much consequence  however  as to vex him  if it be but to think he can t make a fool of such a one as i  and that is nothing at all  but a rebuke to the pride of his high condition which he did not expect  and knows not how to put up with there is something in that  may be  said she  but  indeed  pamela  he is very angry with you too  and calls you twenty perverse things  wonders at his own folly  to have shewn you so much favour  as he calls it which he was first inclined to  he says  for his mother s sake  and would have persisted to shew you for your own  if you was not your own enemy nay  now i shan t love you  mrs  jervis  said i  you are going to persuade me to ask to stay  though you know the hazards i run no  said she  he says you shall go  for he thinks it won t be for his reputation to keep you  but he wished don t speak of it for the world  pamela that he knew a lady of birth  just such another as yourself  in person and mind  and he would marry her to morrow i coloured up to the ears at this word  but said  yet  if i was the lady of birth  and he would offer to be rude first  as he has twice done to poor me  i don t know whether i would have him  for she that can bear an insult of that kind  i should think not worthy to be a gentleman s wife any more than he would be a gentleman that would offer it nay  now  pamela  said she  thou carriest thy notions a great way  well dear mrs  jervis  said i  very seriously  for i could not help it  i am more full of fears than ever  i have only to beg of you  as one of the best friends i have in the world  to say nothing of my asking to stay  to say my master likes me  when i know what end he aims at  is abomination to my ears  and i shan t think myself safe till i am at my poor father s and mother s she was a little angry with me  till i assured her that i had not the least uneasiness on her account  but thought myself safe under her protection and friendship  and so we dropt the discourse for that time i hope to have finished this ugly waistcoat in two days  after which i have only some linen to get up  and shall then let you know how i contrive as to my passage  for the heavy rains will make it sad travelling on foot  but may be i may get a place to which is ten miles of the way  in farmer nichols s close cart  for i can t sit a horse well at all  and may be nobody will be suffered to see me on upon the way but i hope to let you know more  from  etc letter xxii my dear father and mother all my fellow servants have now some notion that i am to go away  but can t imagine for what  mrs  jervis tells them  that my father and mother  growing in years  cannot live without me  and so i go home to them  to help to comfort their old age  but they seem not to believe it what they found it out by was  the butler heard him say to me  as i passed by him  in the entry leading to the hall  who s that  pamela sir  said i  pamela  said he  how long are you to stay here only please your honour  said i  till i have done the waistcoat  and it is almost finished you might  says he  very roughly indeed  have finished that long enough ago  i should have thought  indeed  and please your honour  said i  i have worked early and late upon it  there is a great deal of work in it work in it  said he  you mind your pen more than your needle  i don t want such idle sluts to stay in my house he seemed startled  when he saw the butler  as he entered the hall where mr  jonathan stood  what do you here  said he the butler was as much confounded as i  for  never having been taxed so roughly  i could not help crying sadly  and got out of both their ways to mrs  jervis and told my complaint  this love  said she  is the d  in how many strange shapes does it make people shew themselves  and in some the farthest from their hearts so one  and then another  has been since whispering  pray  mrs  jervis are we to lose mrs  pamela  as they always call me what has she done and she tells them  as above  about going home to you she said afterwards to me  well  pamela  you have made our master  from the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world  one of the most peevish but you have it in your power to make him as sweet tempered as ever though i hope you ll never do it on his terms this was very good in mrs  jervis  but it intimated  that she thought as ill of his designs as i  and as she knew his mind more than i  it convinced me that i ought to get away as fast as i could my master came in  just now  to speak to mrs  jervis about household matters  having some company to dine with him to morrow  and i stood up and having been crying at his roughness in the entry  i turned away my face you may well  said he  turn away your cursed face  i wish i had never seen it mrs  jervis  how long is she to be about this waistcoat sir  said i  if your honour had pleased  i would have taken it with me and though it would be now finished in a few hours  i will do so still and remove this hated poor pamela out of your house and sight for ever mrs  jervis  said he  not speaking to me  i believe this little slut has the power of witchcraft  if ever there was a witch  for she enchants all that come near her  she makes even you  who should know better what the world is  think her an angel of light i offered to go away  for i believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my place  for all this his great wrath  and he said  stay here  stay here when i bid you  and snatched my hand  i trembled  and said  i will  i will  for he hurt my fingers  he grasped me so hard he seemed to have a mind to say something to me  but broke off abruptly and said  begone  and away i tripped as fast as i could  and he and mrs  jervis had a deal of talk  as she told me  and among the rest  he expressed himself vexed to have spoken in mr  jonathan s hearing now you must know  that mr  jonathan  our butler  is a very grave good sort of old man  with his hair as white as silver  and an honest worthy man he is  i was hurrying out with a flea in my ear  as the saying is and going down stairs into the parlour  met him  he took hold of my hand in a gentler manner  though  than my master  with both his  and he said  ah  sweet  sweet mrs  pamela  what is it i heard but just now i am sorry at my heart  but i am sure i will sooner believe any body in fault than you  thank you  mr  jonathan  said i  but as you value your place  don t be seen speaking to such a one as me  i cried too  and slipt away as fast as i could from him  for his own sake  lest he should be seen to pity me and now i will give you an instance how much i am in mr  longman s esteem also i had lost my pen some how  and my paper being written out  i stepped to mr  longman s  our steward s  office  to beg him to give me a pen or two  and a sheet or two of paper  he said  ay  that i will  my sweet maiden  and gave me three pens  some wafers  a stick of wax  and twelve sheets of paper  and coming from his desk  where he was writing  he said  let me have a word or two with you  my sweet little mistress  for so these two good old gentlemen often call me  for i believe they love me dearly  i hear bad news  that we are going to lose you  i hope it is not true  yes it is  sir  said i  but i was in hopes it would not be known till i went away what a d l  said he  ails our master of late  i never saw such an alteration in any man in my life  he is pleased with nobody as i see and by what mr  jonathan tells me just now  he was quite out of the way with you  what could you have done to him  tro  only mrs  jervis is a very good woman  or i should have feared she had been your enemy no  said i  nothing like it  mrs  jervis is a just good woman  and next to my father and mother  the best friend i have in the world well then  said he  it must be worse  shall i guess  you are too pretty  my sweet mistress  and  may be  too virtuous  ah  have i not hit it  no good mr  longman  said i  don t think any thing amiss of my master  he is cross and angry with me indeed  that s true  but i may have given occasion for it  possibly  and because i am desirous to go to my father and mother  rather than stay here  perhaps he may think me ungrateful but  you know  sir  said i  that a father and mother s comfort is the dearest thing to a good child that can be  sweet excellence  said he this becomes you  but i know the world and mankind too well  though i must hear  and see  and say nothing  and so a blessing attend my little sweeting  said he  wherever you go  and away went i with a courtesy and thanks now this pleases one  my dear father and mother  to be so beloved how much better  by good fame and integrity  is it to get every one s good word but one  than  by pleasing that one  to make every one else one s enemy  and be an execrable creature besides  i am  etc letter xxiii my dear father and mother we had a great many neighbouring gentlemen  and their ladies  this day at dinner  and my master made a fine entertainment for them  and isaac and mr  jonathan  and benjamin  waited at table  and isaac tells mrs jervis  that the ladies will by and by come to see the house  and have the curiosity to see me  for  it seems  they said to my master  when the jokes flew about  well  mr  b  we understand you have a servant maid  who is the greatest beauty in the county  and we promise ourselves to see her before we go the wench is well enough  said he  but no such beauty as you talk of i ll assure ye  she was my mother s waiting maid  who  on her death bed engaged me to be kind to her  she is young  and every thing is pretty that is young ay  ay  said one of the ladies  that s true  but if your mother had not recommended her so strongly  there is so much merit in beauty  that i make no doubt such a fine gentleman would have wanted no inducement to be kind to it they all laughed at my master  and he  it seems  laughed for company but said  i don t know how it is  but i see with different eyes from other people  for i have heard much more talk of her prettiness  than i think it deserves  she is well enough  as i said  but her greatest excellence is  that she is humble  and courteous  and faithful  and makes all her fellow servants love her  my housekeeper  in particular doats upon her  and you know  ladies  she is a woman of discernment and  as for mr  longman  and jonathan  here  if they thought themselves young enough  i am told  they would fight for her  is it not true jonathan  troth  sir  said he  an t please your honour  i never knew her peer  and all your honour s family are of the same mind  do you hear now  said my master well  said the ladies  we will make a visit to mrs  jervis by and by  and hope to see this paragon i believe they are coming  and will tell you the rest by and by  i wish they had come  and were gone  why can t they make their game without me well  these fine ladies have been here  and are gone back again  i would have been absent  if i could  and did step into the closet  so they saw me when they came in there were four of them  lady arthur at the great white house on the hill  lady brooks  lady towers  and the other  it seems  a countess  of some hard name  i forget what so mrs  jervis  says one of the ladies  how do you do  we are all come to inquire after your health  i am much obliged to your ladyships said mrs  jervis  will your ladyships please to sit down  but  said the countess  we are not only come to ask after mrs  jervis s health neither  but we are come to see a rarity besides  ah  says lady arthur i have not seen your pamela these two years  and they tell me she is grown wondrous pretty in that time then i wished i had not been in the closet  for when i came out  they must needs know i heard them  but i have often found  that bashful bodies owe themselves a spite  and frequently confound themselves more by endeavouring to avoid confusion why  yes  says mrs  jervis  pamela is very pretty indeed  she s but in the closet there pamela  pray step hither  i came out all covered with blushes  and they smiled at one another the countess took me by the hand  why  indeed  she was pleased to say report has not been too lavish  i ll assure you  don t be ashamed child  and stared full in my face  i wish i had just such a face to be ashamed of  o how like a fool i looked lady arthur said  ay  my good pamela  i say as her ladyship says  don t be so confused  though  indeed  it becomes you too  i think your good lady departed made a sweet choice of such a pretty attendant  she would have been mighty proud of you  as she always was praising you  had she lived till now ah  madam  said lady brooks  do you think that so dutiful a son as our neighbour  who always admired what his mother loved  does not pride himself  for all what he said at table  in such a pretty maiden she looked with such a malicious sneering countenance  i can t abide her lady towers said with a free air  for it seems she is called a wit well  mrs  pamela  i can t say i like you so well as these ladies do for i should never care  if you were my servant  to have you and your master in the same house together  then they all set up a great laugh i know what i could have said  if i durst  but they are ladies and ladies may say any thing says lady towers  can the pretty image speak  mrs  jervis  i vow she has speaking eyes  o you little rogue  said she  and tapped me on the cheek you seem born to undo  or to be undone god forbid  and please your ladyship  said i  it should be either i beg  said i  to withdraw  for the sense i have of my unworthiness renders me unfit for such a presence i then went away  with one of my best courtesies  and lady towers said as i went out  prettily said  i vow and lady brooks said  see that shape  i never saw such a face and shape in my life  why  she must be better descended than you have told me and so they run on for half an hour more in my praises  as i was told and glad was i  when i got out of the hearing of them but  it seems  they went down with such a story to my master  and so full of me  that he had much ado to stand it  but as it was very little to my reputation  i am sure i could take no pride in it  and i feared it would make no better for me  this gives me another cause for wishing myself out of this house this is thursday morning  and next thursday i hope to set out  for i have finished my task  and my master is horrid cross  and i am vexed his crossness affects me so  if ever he had any kindness towards me  i believe he now hates me heartily is it not strange  that love borders so much upon hate  but this wicked love is not like the true virtuous love  to be sure  that and hatred must be as far off  as light and darkness  and how must this hate have been increased  if he had met with such a base compliance  after his wicked will had been gratified well  one may see by a little  what a great deal means  for if innocence cannot attract common civility  what must guilt expect  when novelty has ceased to have its charms  and changeableness had taken place of it thus we read in holy writ  that wicked amnon  when he had ruined poor tamar  hated her more than he ever loved her  and would have turned her out of door how happy am i  to be turned out of door  with that sweet companion my innocence o may that be always my companion  and while i presume not upon my own strength  and am willing to avoid the tempter  i hope the divine grace will assist me forgive me  that i repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer  i owe every thing  next to god s goodness  to your piety and good examples  my dear parents  my dear poor parents  i say that word with pleasure  for your poverty is my pride  as your integrity shall be my imitation as soon as i have dined  i will put on my new clothes  i long to have them on  i know i shall surprise mrs  jervis with them  for she shan t see me till i am full dressed john is come back  and i ll soon send you some of what i have written i find he is going early in the morning  and so i ll close here  that i am                                    your most dutiful daughter don t lose your time in meeting me  because i am so uncertain  it is hard if  some how or other  i can t get a passage to you  but may be my master won t refuse to let john bring me  i can ride behind him  i believe  well enough  for he is very careful  and very honest  and you know john as well as i  for he loves you both  besides  may be  mrs jervis can put me in some way letter xxiv dear father and mother i shall write on  as long as i stay  though i should have nothing but silliness to write  for i know you divert yourselves on nights with what i write  because it is mine  john tells me how much you long for my coming  but he says  he told you he hoped something would happen to hinder it i am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away  for if my fellow servants should guess  it were better so  than to have it from you or me  besides  i really am concerned  that my master should cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me  for  besides the disgrace  it has quite turned his temper  and i begin to believe what mrs  jervis told me  that he likes me  and can t help it  and yet strives to conquer it  and so finds no way but to be cross to me don t think me presumptuous and conceited  for it is more my concern than my pride  to see such a gentleman so demean himself  and lessen the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants  on my account but i am to tell you of my new dress to day and so  when i had dined  up stairs i went  and locked myself into my little room  there i tricked myself up as well as i could in my new garb  and put on my round eared ordinary cap  but with a green knot however  and my homespun gown and petticoat  and plain leather shoes but yet they are what they call spanish leather  and my ordinary hose ordinary i mean to what i have been lately used to  though i shall think good yarn may do very well for every day  when i come home  a plain muslin tucker i put on  and my black silk necklace  instead of the french necklace my lady gave me  and put the ear rings out of my ears and when i was quite equipped  i took my straw hat in my hand  with its two blue strings  and looked about me in the glass  as proud as any thing to say truth  i never liked myself so well in my life o the pleasure of descending with ease  innocence  and resignation indeed  there is nothing like it  an humble mind  i plainly see  cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment  let fortune s wheel turn round as it will so i went down to look for mrs  jervis  to see how she liked me i met  as i was upon the stairs  our rachel  who is the house maid  and she made me a low courtesy  and i found did not know me  so i smiled and went to the housekeeper s parlour  and there sat good mrs  jervis at work  making a shift  and  would you believe it  she did not know me at first  but rose up  and pulled off her spectacles  and said  do you want me  forsooth  i could not help laughing  and said  hey day  mrs  jervis what  don t you know me she stood all in amaze  and looked at me from top to toe  why  you surprise me  said she  what  pamela thus metamorphosed  how came this about as it happened  in stept my master  and my back being to him  he thought it was a stranger speaking to mrs  jervis  and withdrew again  and did not hear her ask  if his honour had any commands for her she turned me about and about  and i shewed her all my dress  to my under petticoat and she said  sitting down  why  i am all in amaze  i must sit down what can all this mean  i told her  i had no clothes suitable to my condition when i returned to my father s  and so it was better to begin here  as i was soon to go away  that all my fellow servants might see i knew how to suit myself to the state i was returning to well  said she  i never knew the like of thee  but this sad preparation for going away for now i see you are quite in earnest  is what i know not how to get over  o my dear pamela  how can i part with you my master rung in the back parlour  and so i withdrew  and mrs  jervis went to attend him  it seems  he said to her  i was coming in to let you know  that i shall go to lincolnshire  and possibly to my sister davers s  and be absent some weeks  but  pray  what pretty neat damsel was with you  she says  she smiled  and asked  if his honour did not know who it was  no  said he  i never saw her before  farmer nichols or farmer brady  have neither of them such a tight prim lass for a daughter  have they though i did not see her face neither  said he if your honour won t be angry  said she  i will introduce her into your presence  for i think  says she  she outdoes our pamela now i did not thank her for this  as i told her afterwards  for it brought a great deal of trouble upon me  as well as crossness  as you shall hear  that can t be  he was pleased to say  but if you can find an excuse for it  let her come in at that she stept to me  and told me  i must go in with her to her master  but  said she  for goodness  sake  let him find you out  for he don t know you  o fie  mrs  jervis  said i  how could you serve me so besides  it looks too free both in me  and to him  i tell you  said she you shall come in  and pray don t reveal yourself till he finds you out so i went in  foolish as i was  though i must have been seen by him another time  if i had not then  and she would make me take my straw hat in my hand i dropt a low courtesy  but said never a word  i dare say he knew me as soon as he saw my face  but was as cunning as lucifer  he came up to me and took me by the hand  and said  whose pretty maiden are you i dare say you are pamela s sister  you are so like her  so neat  so clean  so pretty  why  child  you far surpass your sister pamela i was all confusion  and would have spoken  but he took me about the neck  why  said he  you are very pretty  child  i would not be so free with your sister  you may believe  but i must kiss you o sir  said i  i am pamela  indeed i am  indeed i am pamela  her own self he kissed me for all i could do  and said  impossible  you are a lovelier girl by half than pamela  and sure i may be innocently free with you  though i would not do her so much favour this was a sad trick upon me  indeed  and what i could not expect  and mrs  jervis looked like a fool as much as i  for her officiousness at last i got away  and ran out of the parlour  most sadly vexed  as you may well think he talked a good deal to mrs  jervis  and at last ordered me to come in to him  come in  said he  you little villain for so he called me good sirs  what a name was there who is it you put your tricks upon i was resolved never to honour your unworthiness  said he  with so much notice again  and so you must disguise yourself to attract me  and yet pretend  like an hypocrite as you are i was out of patience then  hold  good sir  said i  don t impute disguise and hypocrisy to me  above all things  for i hate them both mean as i am  i have put on no disguise what a plague  said he  for that was his word  do you mean then by this dress why  and please your honour  said i  i mean one of the honestest things in the world i have been in disguise  indeed  ever since my good lady your mother took me from my poor parents  i came to her ladyship so poor and mean that these clothes i have on  are a princely suit to those i had then and her goodness heaped upon me rich clothes  and other bounties  and as i am now returning to my poor parents again so soon  i cannot wear those good things without being hooted at  and so have bought what will be more suitable to my degree  and be a good holiday suit too  when i get home he then took me in his arms  and presently pushed me from him  mrs jervis  said he  take the little witch from me  i can neither bear nor forbear her strange words these but stay  you shan t go yet begone no  come back again i thought he was mad  for my share  for he knew not what he would have i was going  however  but he stept after me  and took hold of my arm and brought me in again  i am sure he made my arm black and blue  for the marks are upon it still  sir  sir  said i  pray have mercy  i will i will come in he sat down  and looked at me  and  as i thought afterwards  as sillily as such a poor girl as i  at last he said  well  mrs  jervis  as i was telling you  you may permit her to stay a little longer  till i see if my sister davers will have her  if  mean time  she humble herself  and ask this as a favour  and is sorry for her pertness  and the liberty she has taken with my character out of the house  and in the house your honour indeed told me so  said mrs  jervis  but i never found her inclinable to think herself in a fault  pride and perverseness  said he with a vengeance  yet this is your doating piece well  for once i ll submit myself to tell you  hussy  said he to me  you may stay a fortnight longer  till i see my sister davers  do you hear what i say to you  statue  can you neither speak nor be thankful your honour frights me so  said i  that i can hardly speak  but i will venture to say that i have only to beg  as a favour  that i may go to my father and mother why fool  said he  won t you like to go to wait on my sister davers  sir  said i  i was once fond of that honour  but you were pleased to say  i might be in danger from her ladyship s nephew  or he from me d d impertinence  said he  do you hear  mrs  jervis  do you hear  how she retorts upon me  was ever such matchless assurance i then fell a weeping  for mrs  jervis said  fie  pamela  fie and i said  my lot is very hard indeed  i am sure i would hurt nobody  and i have been  it seems  guilty of indiscretions  which have cost me my place  and my master s favour  and so have been turned away  and when the time is come  that i should return to my poor parents  i am not suffered to go quietly  good your honour  what have i done  that i must be used worse than if i had robbed you robbed me  said he  why so you have  hussy  you have robbed me  who  i sir  said i  have i robbed you  why then you are a justice of peace  and may send me to gaol  if you please  and bring me to a trial for my life if you can prove that i have robbed you  i am sure i ought to die now i was quite ignorant of his meaning  though i did not like it  when it was afterwards explained  neither  and well  thought i  what will this come to at last  if poor pamela is esteemed a thief  then i thought in an instant  how i should shew my face to my honest poor parents  if i was but suspected  but  sir  said i  let me ask you but one question and pray don t let me be called names for it  for i don t mean disrespectfully  why  if i have done amiss  am i not left to be discharged by your housekeeper  as the other maids have been  and if jane  or rachel  or hannah  were to offend  would your honour stoop to take notice of them  and why should you so demean yourself to take notice of me  pray  sir  if i have not been worse than others  why should i suffer more than others  and why should i not be turned away and there s an end of it  for indeed i am not of consequence enough for my master to concern himself  and be angry about such a creature as me do you hear  mrs  jervis  cried he again  how pertly i am interrogated by this saucy slut  why  sauce box  says he  did not my good mother desire me to take care of you  and have you not been always distinguished by me  above a common servant  and does your ingratitude upbraid me for this i said something mutteringly  and he vowed he would hear it  i begged excuse  but he insisted upon it  why  then  said i  if your honour must know  i said  that my good lady did not desire your care to extend to the summer house  and her dressing room well  this was a little saucy  you ll say and he flew into such a passion  that i was forced to run for it  and mrs  jervis said  it was happy i got out of the way why what makes him provoke one so  then i m almost sorry for it  but i would be glad to get away at any rate  for i begin to be more fearful now just now mr  jonathan sent me these lines bless me  what shall i do dear mrs  pamela  take care of yourself  for rachel heard my master say to mrs  jervis  who  she believes  was pleading for you  say no more mrs  jervis  for by g d i will have her  burn this instantly o pray for your poor daughter  i am called to go to bed by mrs  jervis for it is past eleven  and i am sure she shall hear of it  for all this is owing to her  though she did not mean any harm  but i have been  and am  in a strange fluster  and i suppose too  she ll say  i have been full pert o my dear father and mother  power and riches never want advocates  but poor gentlewoman  she cannot live without him  and he has been very good to her so good night  may be i shall send this in the morning  but may be not so won t conclude  though i can t say too often  that i am though with great apprehension                      your most dutiful daughter letter xxv my dear parents o let me take up my complaint  and say  never was poor creature so unhappy  and so barbarously used  as poor pamela  indeed  my dear father and mother  my heart s just broke  i can neither write as i should do nor let it alone  for to whom but you can i vent my griefs  and keep my poor heart from bursting  wicked  wicked man i have no patience when i think of him but yet  don t be frightened for i hope i hope  i am honest but if my head and my hand will let me  you shall hear all is there no constable  nor headborough  though  to take me out of his house  for i am sure i can safely swear the peace against him  but alas  he is greater than any constable  he is a justice himself  such a justice deliver me from but god almighty  i hope  in time  will right me for he knows the innocence of my heart john went your way in the morning  but i have been too much distracted to send by him  and have seen nobody but mrs  jervis or rachel  and one i hate to see or be seen by and indeed i hate now to see any body strange things i have to tell you  that happened since last night  that good mr  jonathan s letter  and my master s harshness  put me into such a fluster  but i will not keep you in suspense i went to mrs  jervis s chamber  and  o dreadful  my wicked master had hid himself  base gentleman as he is  in her closet  where she has a few books  and chest of drawers  and such like  i little suspected it though i used  till this sad night  always to look into that closet and another in the room  and under the bed  ever since the summer house trick  but never found any thing  and so i did not do it then  being fully resolved to be angry with mrs  jervis for what had happened in the day  and so thought of nothing else i sat myself down on one side of the bed  and she on the other  and we began to undress ourselves  but she on that side next the wicked closet that held the worst heart in the world  so  said mrs  jervis  you won t speak to me  pamela  i find you are angry with me  why  mrs  jervis said i  so i am  a little  tis a folly to deny it  you see what i have suffered by your forcing me in to my master  and a gentlewoman of your years and experience must needs know  that it was not fit for me to pretend to be any body else for my own sake  nor with regard to my master but  said she  who would have thought it would have turned out so  ay said i  little thinking who heard me  lucifer always is ready to promote his own work and workmen  you see presently what use he made of it pretending not to know me  on purpose to be free with me  and when he took upon himself to know me  to quarrel with me  and use me hardly  and you too  said i  to cry  fie  fie  pamela  cut me to the heart  for that encouraged him do you think  my dear  said she  that i would encourage him i never said so to you before  but  since you have forced it from me  i must tell you  that  ever since you consulted me  i have used my utmost endeavours to divert him from his wicked purposes  and he has promised fair  but  to say all in a word  he doats upon you  and i begin to see it is not in his power to help it i luckily said nothing of the note from mr  jonathan  for i began to suspect all the world almost  but i said  to try mrs  jervis  well then what would you have me do  you see he is for having me wait on lady davers now why  i ll tell you freely  my dear pamela  said she  and i trust to your discretion to conceal what i say  my master has been often desiring me to put you upon asking him to let you stay yes  said i  mrs  jervis  let me interrupt you  i will tell you why i could not think of that  it was not the pride of my heart  but the pride of my honesty  for what must have been the case  here my master has been very rude to me  once and twice  and you say he cannot help it  though he pretends to be sorry for it  well  he has given me warning to leave my place  and uses me very harshly  perhaps to frighten me to his purposes  as he supposes i would be fond of staying as indeed i should if i could be safe  for i love you and all the house  and value him  if he would act as my master  well then  as i know his designs  and that he owns he cannot help it  must i have asked to stay  knowing he would attempt me again  for all you could assure me of  was  he would do nothing by force  so i  a poor weak girl  was to be left to my own strength  and was not this to allow him to tempt me  as one may say  and to encourage him to go on in his wicked devices how then  mrs  jervis could i ask or wish to stay you say well  my dear child  says she  and you have a justness of thought above your years  and for all these considerations  and for what i have heard this day  after you ran away  and i am glad you went as you did  i cannot persuade you to stay  and i shall be glad  which is what i never thought i could have said  that you were well at your father s  for if lady davers will entertain you  she may as well have you from thence as here  there s my good mrs  jervis  said i  god will bless you for your good counsel to a poor maiden  that is hard beset but pray what did he say  when i was gone  why  says she  he was very angry with you  but he would hear it  said i  i think it was a little bold  but then he provoked me to it  and had not my honesty been in the case  i would not by any means have been so saucy  besides  mrs jervis  consider it was the truth  if he does not love to hear of the summer house  and the dressing room  why should he not be ashamed to continue in the same mind  but  said she  when you had muttered this to yourself  you might have told him any thing else  well  said i  i cannot tell a wilful lie  and so there s an end of it  but i find you now give him up  and think there s danger in staying lord bless me  i wish i was well out of the house  so it was at the bottom of a wet ditch  on the wildest common in england why  said she  it signifies nothing to tell you all he said but it was enough to make me fear you would not be so safe as i could wish and  upon my word  pamela  i don t wonder he loves you  for  without flattery  you are a charming girl  and i never saw you look more lovely in your life than in that same new dress of yours  and then it was such a surprise upon us all i believe truly  you owe some of your danger to the lovely appearance you made  then  said i  i wish the clothes in the fire  i expected no effect from them  but  if any  a quite contrary one hush  said i  mrs  jervis  did you not hear something stir in the closet  no  silly girl  said she  your fears are always awake but indeed  said i  i think i heard something rustle may be  says she  the cat may be got there  but i hear nothing i was hush  but she said  pr ythee  my good girl  make haste to bed  see if the door be fast  so i did  and was thinking to look into the closet but  hearing no more noise  thought it needless  and so went again and sat myself down on the bed side  and went on undressing myself  and mrs  jervis being by this time undressed  stepped into bed  and bid me hasten  for she was sleepy i don t know what was the matter  but my heart sadly misgave me  indeed mr  jonathan s note was enough to make it do so  with what mrs  jervis had said  i pulled off my stays  and my stockings  and all my clothes to an under petticoat  and then hearing a rustling again in the closet  i said  heaven protect us  but before i say my prayers  i must look into this closet  and so was going to it slip shod  when  o dreadful  out rushed my master in a rich silk and silver morning gown i screamed  and ran to the bed  and mrs  jervis screamed too  and he said  i ll do you no harm  if you forbear this noise  but otherwise take what follows instantly he came to the bed for i had crept into it  to mrs  jervis with my coat on  and my shoes  and taking me in his arms  said  mrs jervis  rise  and just step up stairs to keep the maids from coming down at this noise  i ll do no harm to this rebel o  for heaven s sake  for pity s sake  mrs  jervis  said i  if i am not betrayed  don t leave me  and  i beseech you  raise all the house  no said mrs  jervis  i will not stir  my dear lamb  i will not leave you i wonder at you  sir  said she  and kindly threw herself upon my coat clasping me round the waist  you shall not hurt this innocent  said she for i will lose my life in her defence  are there not  said she  enough wicked ones in the world  for your base purpose  but you must attempt such a lamb as this he was desperate angry  and threatened to throw her out of the window and to turn her out of the house the next morning  you need not  sir said she  for i will not stay in it  god defend my poor pamela till to morrow  and we will both go together says he  let me but expostulate a word or two with you  pamela  pray  pamela  said mrs jervis  don t hear a word  except he leaves the bed  and goes to the other end of the room  ay  out of the room  said i  expostulate to morrow  if you must expostulate i found his hand in my bosom  and when my fright let me know it  i was ready to die  and i sighed and screamed  and fainted away  and still he had his arms about my neck  and mrs  jervis was about my feet  and upon my coat  and all in a cold dewy sweat was i  pamela  pamela  said mrs jervis  as she tells me since  o h  and gave another shriek  my poor pamela is dead for certain  and so  to be sure  i was for a time  for i knew nothing more of the matter  one fit following another  till about three hours after  as it proved to be  i found myself in bed  and mrs jervis sitting upon one side  with her wrapper about her  and rachel on the other  and no master  for the wicked wretch was gone  but i was so overjoyed  that i hardly could believe myself  and i said  which were my first words  mrs  jervis  mrs  rachel  can i be sure it is you  tell me  can i where have i been  hush  my dear  said mrs  jervis  you have been in fit after fit  i never saw any body so frightful in my life by this i judged rachel knew nothing of the matter  and it seems my wicked master had  upon mrs  jervis s second noise on my fainting away slipt out  and  as if he had come from his own chamber  disturbed by the screaming  went up to the maids  room  who  hearing the noise  lay trembling  and afraid to stir  and bid them go down  and see what was the matter with mrs  jervis and me  and he charged mrs  jervis  and promised to forgive her for what she had said and done  if she would conceal the matter  so the maids came down  and all went up again  when i came to myself a little  except rachel  who staid to sit up with me and bear mrs  jervis company  i believe they all guess the matter to be bad enough  though they dare not say any thing when i think of my danger  and the freedoms he actually took  though i believe mrs  jervis saved me from worse  and she said she did  though what can i think  who was in a fit  and knew nothing of the matter  i am almost distracted at first i was afraid of mrs  jervis  but i am fully satisfied she is very good  and i should have been lost but for her  and she takes on grievously about it  what would have become of me  had she gone out of the room  to still the maids  as he bid her  he d certainly have shut her out  and then  mercy on me  what would have become of your poor pamela i must leave off a little  for my eyes and my head are sadly bad this was a dreadful trial  this was the worst of all  oh  that i was out of the power of this dreadfully wicked man  pray for                                              your distressed daughter letter xxvi my dear father and mother i did not rise till ten o clock  and i had all the concerns and wishes of the family  and multitudes of inquiries about me  my wicked master went out early to hunt  but left word he would be in to breakfast  and so he was he came up to our chamber about eleven  and had nothing to do to be sorry  for he was our master  and so put on sharp anger at first i had great emotions at his entering the room  and threw my apron over my head  and fell a crying  as if my heart would break mrs  jervis  said he  since i know you  and you me so well  i don t know how we shall live together for the future  sir  said she  i will take the liberty to say  what i think is best for both  i have so much grief  that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl  and especially in my chamber  that i should think myself accessary to the mischief  if i was not to take notice of it  though my ruin  therefore may depend upon it  i desire not to stay  but pray let poor pamela and me go together  with all my heart  said he  and the sooner the better she fell a crying  i find  says he  this girl has made a party of the whole house in her favour against me  her innocence deserves it of us all  said she very kindly  and i never could have thought that the son of my dear good lady departed  could have so forfeited his honour  as to endeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect  no more of this mrs  jervis  said he  i will not hear it  as for pamela  she has a lucky knack of falling into fits  when she pleases  but the cursed yellings of you both made me not myself  i intended no harm to her  as i told you both  if you d have left your squallings  and i did no harm neither  but to myself  for i raised a hornet s nest about my ears  that  as far as i know  may have stung to death my reputation  sir  said mrs  jervis  then i beg mr  longman may take my accounts  and i will go away as soon as i can  as for pamela  she is at her liberty  i hope  to go away next thursday  as she intends i sat still  for i could not speak nor look up  and his presence discomposed me extremely  but i was sorry to hear myself the unhappy occasion of mrs  jervis s losing her place  and hope that may be still made up well  said he  let mr  longman make up your accounts  as soon as you will  and mrs  jewkes who is his housekeeper in lincolnshire  shall come hither in your place  and won t be less obliging  i dare say  than you have been  said she  i have never disobliged you till now  and let me tell you  sir  if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or honour no more  no more  said he  of these antiquated topics  i have been no bad friend to you  and i shall always esteem you  though you have not been so faithful to my secrets as i could have wished  and have laid me open to this girl  which has made her more afraid of me than she had occasion  well  sir  said she  after what passed yesterday  and last night  i think i went rather too far in favour of your injunctions than otherwise  and i should have deserved every body s censure  as the basest of creatures  had i been capable of contributing to your lawless attempts  still  mrs  jervis  still reflecting upon me  and all for imaginary faults  for what harm have i done the girl i won t bear it i ll assure you  but yet  in respect to my mother  i am willing to part friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom of your conversation  in relation to me  which i should have resented more than i do  but that i am conscious i had no business to demean myself so as to be in your closet  where i might have expected to hear a multitude of impertinence between you well  sir  said she  you have no objection  i hope  to pamela s going away on thursday next  you are mighty solicitous  said he  about pamela but no  not i  let her go as soon as she will  she is a naughty girl and has brought all this upon herself  and upon me more trouble than she can have had from me  but i have overcome it all  and will never concern myself about her i have a proposal made me  added he  since i have been out this morning that i shall go near to embrace  and so wish only  that a discreet use may be made of what is past  and there s an end of every thing with me as to pamela  i ll assure you  i clasped my hands together through my apron  overjoyed at this  though i was soon to go away  for  naughty as he has been to me  i wish his prosperity with all my heart  for my good old lady s sake  well  pamela  said he  you need not now be afraid to speak to me  tell me what you lifted up your hands at  i said not a word  says he  if you like what i have said  give me your hand upon it i held my hand up through my apron  for i could not speak to him  and he took hold of it  and pressed it  though less hard than he did my arm the day before  what does the little fool cover her face for  said he  pull your apron away  and let me see how you look  after your freedom of speech of me last night  no wonder you are ashamed to see me  you know you were very free with my character i could not stand this barbarous insult  as i took it to be  considering his behaviour to me  and i then spoke and said  o the difference between the minds of thy creatures  good god  how shall some be cast down in their innocence  while others can triumph in their guilt and so saying  i went up stairs to my chamber  and wrote all this  for though he vexed me at his taunting  yet i was pleased to hear he was likely to be married  and that his wicked intentions were so happily overcome as to me  and this made me a little easier  and i hope i have passed the worst  or else it is very hard  and yet i shan t think myself at ease quite  till i am with you  for  methinks  after all his repentance and amendment are mighty suddenly resolved upon  but the divine grace is not confined to space  and remorse may  and i hope has smitten him to the heart at once  for his injuries to poor me  yet i won t be too secure neither having opportunity  i send now what i know will grieve you to the heart but i hope i shall bring my next scribble myself  and so conclude though half broken hearted  your ever dutiful daughter letter xxvii dear father and mother i am glad i desired you not to meet me  and john says you won t  for he told you he is sure i shall get a passage well enough  either behind some one of my fellow servants on horseback  or by farmer nichols s means  but as to the chariot he talked to you of  i can t expect that favour  to be sure  and i should not care for it  because it would look so much above me  but farmer brady  they say  has a chaise with one horse  and we hope to borrow that  or hire it  rather than fail  though money runs a little lowish  after what i have laid out  but i don t care to say so here  though i warrant i might have what i would of mrs jervis  or mr  jonathan  or mr  longman  but then how shall i pay it you ll say  and  besides  i don t love to be beholden but the chief reason i m glad you don t set out to meet me  is the uncertainty  for it seems i must stay another week still  and hope certainly to go thursday after  for poor mrs  jervis will go at the same time  she says  and can t be ready before oh  that i was once well with you though he is very civil too at present  and not so cross as he was  and yet he is as vexatious another way  as you shall hear  for yesterday he had a rich suit of clothes brought home  which they call a birth day suit  for he intends to go to london against next birth day  to see the court  and our folks will have it he is to be made a lord i wish they may make him an honest man  as he was always thought  but i have not found it so  alas for me and so  as i was saying  he had these clothes come home  and he tried them on  and before he pulled them off  he sent for me  when nobody else was in the parlour with him  pamela  said he  you are so neat and so nice in your own dress  alack a day  i didn t know i was  that you must be a judge of ours  how are these clothes made  do they fit me i am no judge  said i  and please your honour  but i think they look very fine his waistcoat stood on end with silver lace  and he looked very grand but what he did last  has made me very serious  and i could make him no compliments  said he  why don t you wear your usual clothes  though i think every thing looks well upon you for i still continue in my new dress  i said  i have no clothes  sir  i ought to call my own  but these  and it is no matter what such an one as i wears  said he  why you look very serious  pamela  i see you can bear malice yes  so i can sir  said i  according to the occasion  why  said he  your eyes always look red  i think  are you not a fool to take my last freedom so much to heart  i am sure you  and that fool mrs  jervis  frightened me  by your hideous squalling  as much as i could frighten you  that is all we had for it  said i  and if you could be so afraid of your own servants knowing of your attempts upon a poor unworthy creature  that is under your protection while i stay  surely your honour ought to be more afraid of god almighty  in whose presence we all stand  in every action of our lives  and to whom the greatest  as well as the least  must be accountable  let them think what they list he took my hand  in a kind of good humoured mockery  and said  well urged  my pretty preacher  when my lincolnshire chaplain dies  i ll put thee on a gown and cassock  and thou lt make a good figure in his place i wish  said i  a little vexed at his jeer  your honour s conscience would be your preacher  and then you would need no other chaplain  well  well  pamela  said he  no more of this unfashionable jargon  i did not send for you so much for your opinion of my new suit as to tell you  you are welcome to stay  since mrs  jervis desires it till she goes  i welcome  said i  i am sure i shall rejoice when i am out of the house well  said he  you are an ungrateful baggage  but i am thinking it would be pity  with these fair soft hands  and that lovely skin  as he called it  and took hold of my hand  that you should return again to hard work  as you must if you go to your father s  and so i would advise her to take a house in london  and let lodgings to us members of parliament when we come to town  and such a pretty daughter as you may pass for will always fill her house  and she ll get a great deal of money i was sadly vexed at this barbarous joke  but being ready to cry before the tears gushed out  and endeavouring to get my hand from him  but in vain  i said  i can expect no better  your behaviour  sir  to me  has been just of a piece with these words  nay  i will say it  though you were to be ever so angry i angry  pamela  no  no  said he  i have overcome all that  and as you are to go away  i look upon you now as mrs  jervis s guest while you both stay  and not as my servant  and so you may say what you will  but i ll tell you  pamela  why you need not take this matter in such high disdain you have a very pretty romantic turn for virtue  and all that and i don t suppose but you ll hold it still  and nobody will be able to prevail upon you  but  my child sneeringly he spoke it  do but consider what a fine opportunity you will then have for a tale every day to good mother jervis  and what subjects for letter writing to your father and mother  and what pretty preachments you may hold forth to the young gentlemen  ad s my heart  i think it would be the best thing you and she could do you do well  sir  said i  to even your wit to such a poor maiden as me but  permit me to say  that if you was not rich and great  and i poor and little  you would not insult me thus let me ask you  sir  if you think this becomes your fine clothes  and a master s station  why so serious  my pretty pamela  said he  why so grave  and would kiss me  but my heart was full  and i said  let me alone  i will tell you  if you was a king  and insulted me as you have done  that you have forgotten to act like a gentleman  and i won t stay to be used thus  i will go to the next farmer s  and there wait for mrs  jervis  if she must go  and i d have you know  sir  that i can stoop to the ordinariest work of your scullions  for all these nasty soft hands  sooner than bear such ungentlemanly imputations i sent for you  said he  in high good humour  but it is impossible to hold it with such an impertinent  however  i ll keep my temper  but while i see you here  pray don t put on those dismal grave looks  why girl  you should forbear them  if it were but for your pride sake  for the family will think you are grieving to leave the house  then  sir said i  i will try to convince them of the contrary  as well as your honour  for i will endeavour to be more cheerful while i stay  for that very reason well  replied he  i will set this down by itself  as the first time that ever what i had advised had any weight with you  and i will add  said i  as the first advice you have given me of late  that was fit to be followed i wish said he  i am almost ashamed to write it  impudent gentleman as he is  i wish i had thee as quick another way  as thou art in thy repartees and he laughed  and i snatched my hand from him  and i tripped away as fast as i could  ah  thought i  married  i am sure it is time you were married  or  at this rate  no honest maiden ought to live with you why  dear father and mother  to be sure he grows quite a rake  how easy it is to go from bad to worse  when once people give way to vice how would my poor lady  had she lived  have grieved to see it  but may be he would have been better then  though it seems he told mrs  jervis he had an eye upon me in his mother s life time  and he intended to let me know as much  by the bye  he told her  here is shamelessness for you sure the world must be near at an end  for all the gentlemen about are as bad as he almost  as far as i can hear and see the fruits of such bad examples  there is squire martin in the grove  has had three lyings in  it seems  in his house  in three months past  one by himself and one by his coachman  and one by his woodman  and yet he has turned none of them away  indeed  how can he  when they but follow his own vile example  there is he  and two or three more such as he  within ten miles of us  who keep company  and hunt with our fine master  truly  and i suppose he is never the better for their examples  but  heaven bless me say i  and send me out of this wicked house but  dear father and mother  what sort of creatures must the womenkind be  do you think  to give way to such wickedness  why  this it is that makes every one be thought of alike  and  alack a day  what a world we live in  for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted  than that the women comply  this  i suppose  makes me such a sauce box  and bold face  and a creature  and all because i won t be a sauce box and bold face indeed but i am sorry for these things  one don t know what arts and stratagems men may devise to gain their vile ends  and so i will think as well as i can of these poor undone creatures  and pity them  for you see  by my sad story  and narrow escapes  what hardships poor maidens go through whose lot it is to go out to service  especially to houses where there is not the fear of god  and good rule kept by the heads of the family you see i am quite grown grave and serious  indeed it becomes the present condition of your dutiful daughter letter xxviii dear father and mother john says you wept when you read my last letter  that he carried  i am sorry you let him see that  for they all mistrust already how matters are  and as it is no credit that i have been attempted  though it is that i have resisted  yet i am sorry they have cause to think so evil of my master from any of us mrs  jervis has made up her accounts with mr  longman  and will stay in her place  i am glad of it  for her own sake  and for my master s  for she has a good master of him  so indeed all have  but poor me and he has a good housekeeper in her mr  longman  it seems  took upon him to talk to my master  how faithful and careful of his interests she was  and how exact in her accounts and he told him  there was no comparison between her accounts and mrs jewkes s  at the lincolnshire estate he said so many fine things  it seems  of mrs  jervis  that my master sent for her in mr  longman s presence  and said pamela might come along with her  i suppose to mortify me  that i must go while she was to stay but as  when i go away  i am not to go with her  nor was she to go with me  so i did not matter it much  only it would have been creditable to such a poor girl  that the housekeeper would bear me company  if i went said he to her  well  mrs  jervis  longman says you have made up your accounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness  i had a good mind to make you an offer of continuing with me  if you can be a little sorry for your hasty words  which  indeed  were not so respectful as i have deserved at your hands  she seemed at a sad loss what to say because mr  longman was there  and she could not speak of the occasion of those words  which was me indeed  said mr  longman  i must needs say before your face  that since i have known my master s family  i have never found such good management in it  nor so much love and harmony neither  i wish the lincolnshire estate was as well served no more of that  said my master  but mrs jervis may stay  if she will  and here  mrs  jervis  pray accept of this  which at the close of every year s accounts i will present you with  besides your salary  as long as i find your care so useful and agreeable  and he gave her five guineas she made him a low courtesy and thanking him  looked to me  as if she would have spoken to me he took her meaning  i believe  for he said indeed i love to encourage merit and obligingness  longman  but i can never be equally kind to those who don t deserve it at my hands  as to those who do  and then he looked full on me  longman  continued he  i said that girl might come in with mrs  jervis  because they love to be always together  for mrs jervis is very good to her  and loves her as well as if she was her daughter  but else mr  longman  interrupting him  said  good to mrs pamela  ay  sir  and so she is  to be sure  but every body must be good to her  for he was going on  but my master said  no more  no more  mr  longman  i see old men are taken with pretty young girls  as well as other folks and fair looks hide many a fault  where a person has the art to behave obligingly  why  and please your honour  said mr  longman  every body and was going on  i believe  to say something more in my praise but he interrupted him  and said  not a word more of this pamela  i can t let her stay  i ll assure you  not only for her own freedom of speech  but her letter writing of all the secrets of my family  ay  said the good old man  i am sorry for that too  but  sir no more  i say said my master  for my reputation is so well known  mighty fine thought i  that i care not what any body writes or says of me  but to tell you the truth  not that it need go further  i think of changing my condition soon  and  you know  young ladies of birth and fortune will choose their own servants  and that s my chief reason why pamela can t stay  as for the rest  said he  the girl is a good sort of body take her altogether  though i must needs say  a little pert  since my mother s death  in her answers  and gives me two words for one  which i can t bear  nor is there reason i should  you know  longman  no  to be sure  sir  said he  but tis strange  methinks  she should be so mild and meek to every one of us in the house  and forget herself so  where she should shew most respect  very true  mr  longman  said he  but so it is  i ll assure you  and it was from her pertness  that mrs  jervis and i had the words  and i should mind it the less  but that the girl there she stands  i say it to her face  has wit and sense above her years  and knows better i was in great pain to say something  but yet i knew not what  before mr  longman  and mrs  jervis looked at me  and walked to the window to hide her concern for me  at last  i said  it is for you  sir  to say what you please  and for me only to say  god bless your honour poor mr  longman faltered in his speech  and was ready to cry  said my insulting master to me  why  pr ythee  pamela  now  shew thyself as thou art  before longman  can st not give him a specimen of that pertness which thou hast exercised upon me sometimes did he not  my dear father and mother  deserve all the truth to be told yet i overcame myself so far  as to say  well  your honour may play upon a poor girl  that you know can answer you  but dare not why  pr ythee now  insinuator  said he  say the worst you can before longman and mrs  jervis  i challenge the utmost of thy impertinence and as you are going away  and have the love of every body  i would be a little justified to my family  that you have no reason to complain of hardships from me  as i have pert saucy answers from you  besides exposing me by your letters surely  sir  said i  i am of no consequence equal to this  in your honour s family  that such a great gentleman as you  should need to justify yourself about me  i am glad mrs  jervis stays with your honour and i know i have not deserved to stay  and  more than that  i don t desire to stay ads bobbers  said mr  longman  and ran to me  don t say so  don t say so  dear mrs  pamela  we all love you dearly  and pray down of your knees  and ask his honour pardon  and we will all become pleaders in a body  and i  and mrs  jervis too  at the head of it  to beg his honour s pardon  and to continue you  at least  till his honour marries no  mr longman  said i  i cannot ask  nor will i stay  if i might  all i desire is  to return to my poor father and mother  and though i love you all  i won t stay o well a day  well a day  said the good old man  i did not expect this when i had got matters thus far  and had made all up for mrs  jervis  i was in hopes to have got a double holiday of joy for all the family  in your pardon too  well  said my master  this is a little specimen of what i told you  longman  you see there s a spirit you did not expect mrs  jervis told me after  that she could stay no longer  to hear me so hardly used  and must have spoken  had she staid  what would never have been forgiven her  so she went out  i looked after her to go too  but my master said  come  pamela  give another specimen  i desire you  to longman i am sure you must  if you will but speak  well  sir  said i since it seems your greatness wants to be justified by my lowness  and i have no desire you should suffer in the sight of your family  i will say  on my bended knees  and so i kneeled down  that i have been a very faulty  and a very ungrateful creature to the best of masters  i have been very perverse and saucy  and have deserved nothing at your hands but to be turned out of your family with shame and disgrace  i therefore  have nothing to say for myself  but that i am not worthy to stay  and so cannot wish to stay  and will not stay  and so god almighty bless you  and you mr  longman  and good mrs  jervis  and every living soul of the family  and i will pray for you as long as i live and so i rose up  and was forced to lean upon my master s elbow chair  or i should have sunk down the poor old man wept more than i  and said  ads bobbers  was ever the like heard  tis too much  too much  i can t bear it  as i hope to live i am quite melted  dear sir  forgive her  the poor thing prays for you  she prays for us all  she owns her fault  yet won t be forgiven  i profess i know not what to make of it my master himself  hardened wretch as he was  seemed a little moved  and took his handkerchief out of his pocket  and walked to the window what sort of a day is it  said he and then  getting a little more hard heartedness  he said  well  you may be gone from my presence  thou strange medley of inconsistence  but you shan t stay after your time in the house nay  pray  sir  pray  sir  said the good old man  relent a little ads heartikins  you young gentlemen are made of iron and steel  i think i m sure  said he  my heart s turned into butter  and is running away at my eyes  i never felt the like before said my master  with an imperious tone  get out of my presence  hussy  i can t bear you in my sight  sir  said i  i m going as fast as i can but  indeed  my dear father and mother  my head was so giddy  and my limbs trembled so  that i was forced to go holding by the wainscot all the way with both my hands  and thought i should not have got to the door  but when i did  as i hoped this would be my last interview with this terrible hard hearted master  i turned about  and made a low courtesy  and said  god bless you  sir  god bless you  mr  longman and i went into the lobby leading to the great hall  and dropt into the first chair  for i could get no farther a good while i leave all these things to your reflection  my dear parents but i can write no more  my poor heart s almost broken  indeed it is o when shall i get away send me  good god  in safety  once more to my poor father s peaceful cot and there the worst that can happen will be joy in perfection to what i now bear o pity                                       your distressed daughter letter xxix my dear father and mother i must write on  though i shall come so soon  for now i have hardly any thing else to do  i have finished all that lay upon me  and only wait the good time of setting out  mrs  jervis said  i must be low in pocket for what i had laid out  and so would have presented me with two guineas of her five  but i could not take them of her  because  poor gentlewoman  she pays old debts for her children  that were extravagant and wants them herself  this  though  was very good in her i am sorry i shall have but little to bring with me  but i know you won t  you are so good and i will work the harder  when i come home if i can get a little plain work  or any thing  to do  but all your neighbourhood is so poor  that i fear i shall want work  except  may be  dame mumford can help me to something  from any good family she is acquainted with here  what a sad thing it is  i have been brought up wrong  as matters stand  for  you know  my good lady  now in heaven  loved singing and dancing  and  as she would have it  i had a voice  she made me learn both  and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song  and a good psalm too  and dance before her  and i must learn to flower and draw too  and to work fine work with my needle  why  all this too i have got pretty tolerably at my finger s end  as they say  and she used to praise me  and was a good judge of such matters well now  what is all this to the purpose  as things have turned about why  no more nor less  than that i am like the grasshopper in the fable which i have read of in my lady s book  as follows see the aesop s fables which have lately been selected and reformed from those of sir r l estrange  and the most eminent mythologists as the ants were airing their provisions one winter  a hungry grasshopper as suppose it was poor i  begged a charity of them  they told him  that he should have wrought in summer  if he would not have wanted in winter  well  says the grasshopper  but i was not idle neither  for i sung out the whole season  nay  then  said they  you ll e en do well to make a merry year of it  and dance in winter to the time you sung in summer so i shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing  when i come home to you  nay  i shall be unfit even for a may day holiday time for these minuets  rigadoons  and french dances  that i have been practising  will make me but ill company for my milk maid companions that are to be  to be sure i had better  as things stand  have learned to wash and scour  and brew and bake  and such like  put i hope  if i can t get work  and can meet with a place  to learn these soon  if any body will have the goodness to bear with me till i am able  for notwithstanding what my master says  i hope i have an humble and teachable mind  and  next to god s grace  that s all my comfort  for i shall think nothing too mean that is honest  it may be a little hard at first  but woe to my proud heart  if i find it so on trial  for i will make it bend to its condition  or break it i have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion  and he tried how he could bear it  by putting his fingers into the lighted candle  so i  t other day  tried  when rachel s back was turned  if i could not scour a pewter plate she had begun  i see i could do t by degrees  it only blistered my hand in two places all the matter is  if i could get plain work enough  i need not spoil my fingers  but if i can t  i hope to make my hands as red as a blood pudding  and as hard as a beechen trencher  to accommodate them to my condition but i must break off  here s somebody coming tis only our hannah with a message from mrs  jervis but  hold  here s somebody else  well  it is only rachel i am as much frighted  as were the city mouse and the country mouse  in the same book of fables  at every thing that stirs  o  i have a power of these things to entertain you with in winter evenings  when i come home if i can but get work  with a little time for reading  i hope we shall be very happy over our peat fires what made me hint to you  that i should bring but little with me  is this you must know  i did intend to do  as i have this afternoon  and that is  i took all my clothes  and all my linen  and i divided them into three parcels  as i had before told mrs  jervis i intended to do  and i said  it is now monday  mrs  jervis  and i am to go away on thursday morning betimes  so  though i know you don t doubt my honesty  i beg you will look over my poor matters  and let every one have what belongs to them  for  said i  you know i am resolved to take with me only what i can properly call my own said she  i did not know her drift then  to be sure she meant well but i did not thank her for it  when i did know it  let your things be brought down in the green room  and i will do any thing you will have me do with all my heart  said i  green room or any where  but i think you might step up  and see em as they lie however  i fetched em down  and laid them in three parcels  as before and  when i had done  i went down to call her up to look at them now  it seems  she had prepared my master for this scene  unknown to me  and in this green room was a closet  with a sash door  and a curtain before it  for there she puts her sweet meats and such things  and she did it  it seems  to turn his heart  as knowing what i intended  i suppose that he should make me take the things  for  if he had  i should have made money of them  to help us when we got together  for  to be sure  i could never have appeared in them well  as i was saying  he had got  unknown to me  into this closet  i suppose while i went to call mrs  jervis  and she since owned to me  it was at his desire  when she told him something of what i intended  or else she would not have done it  though i have reason  i am sure  to remember the last closet work so i said  when she came up  here  mrs  jervis  is the first parcel i will spread it all abroad  these are the things my good lady gave me in the first place  said i and so i went on describing the clothes and linen my lady had given me  mingling blessings  as i proceeded for her goodness to me  and when i had turned over that parcel  i said well  so much for the first parcel  mrs  jervis  that was my lady s gifts now i come to the presents of my dear virtuous master  hey  you know closet for that  mrs  jervis  she laughed  and said  i never saw such a comical girl in my life  but go on  i will  mrs  jervis  said i  as soon as i have opened the bundle  for i was as brisk and as pert as could be little thinking who heard me now here  mrs  jervis  said i  are my ever worthy master s presents  and then i particularised all those in the second bundle after which  i turned to my own  and said now  mrs  jervis  comes poor pamela s bundle  and a little one it is to the others  first  here is a calico nightgown  that i used to wear o mornings  twill be rather too good for me when i get home  but i must have something  then there is a quilted calamanco coat  and a pair of stockings i bought of the pedlar  and my straw hat with blue strings and a remnant of scots cloth  which will make two shirts and two shifts the same i have on  for my poor father and mother  and here are four other shifts  one the fellow to that i have on  another pretty good one and the other two old fine ones  that will serve me to turn and wind with at home  for they are not worth leaving behind me  and here are two pair of shoes  i have taken the lace off  which i will burn  and may be will fetch me some little matter at a pinch  with an old silver buckle or two what do you laugh for  mrs  jervis  said i why you are like an april day  you cry and laugh in a breath well  let me see  ay  here is a cotton handkerchief i bought of the pedlar there should be another somewhere  o  here it is  and here too are my new bought knit mittens  and this is my new flannel coat  the fellow to that i have on and in this parcel  pinned together  are several pieces of printed calico  remnants of silks  and such like that  if good luck should happen  and i should get work  would serve for robins and facings  and such like uses  and here too are a pair of pockets  they are too fine for me  but i have no worse  bless me  said i  i did not think i had so many good things well  mrs  jervis  said i  you have seen all my store  and i will now sit down  and tell you a piece of my mind be brief then  said she  my good girl  for she was afraid  she said afterwards  that i should say too much why then the case is this  i am to enter upon a point of equity and conscience  mrs  jervis  and i must beg  if you love me  you d let me have my own way  those things there of my lady s  i can have no claim to  so as to take them away  for she gave them me  supposing i was to wear them in her service  and to do credit to her bountiful heart  but since i am to be turned away  you know  i cannot wear them at my poor father s  for i should bring all the little village upon my back  and so i resolve not to have them then  mrs  jervis  said i  i have far less right to these of my worthy master s  for you see what was his intention in giving them to me  so they were to be the price of my shame  and if i could make use of them i should think i should never prosper with them  and  besides  you know mrs  jervis  if i would not do the good gentleman s work  why should i take his wages  so  in conscience  in honour  in every thing  i have nothing to say to thee  thou second wicked bundle but  said i  cone to my arms  my dear third parcel  the companion of my poverty  and the witness of my honesty  and may i never deserve the least rag that is contained in thee  when i forfeit a title to that innocence  that i hope will ever be the pride of my life  and then i am sure it will be my highest comfort at my death  when all the riches and pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn by beggars  and so i hugged my third bundle but  said i  mrs  jervis  and she wept to hear me  one thing more i have to trouble you with  and that s all there are four guineas  you know  that came out of my good lady s pocket  when she died  that  with some silver  my master gave me  now these same four guineas i sent to my poor father and mother  and they have broken them  but would make them up  if i would  and if you think it should be so  it shall  but pray tell me honestly your mind  as to the three years before my lady s death  do you think  as i had no wages i may be supposed to be quits by quits  i cannot mean that my poor services should be equal to my lady s goodness  for that s impossible but as all her learning and education of me  as matters have turned will be of little service to me now  for it had been better for me to have been brought up to hard labour  to be sure  for that i must turn to at last  if i can t get a place  and you know  in places too  one is subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of  so  i say  by quits i only mean  as i return all the good things she gave me  whether i may not set my little services against my keeping  because  as i said my learning is not now in the question  and i am sure my dear good lady would have thought so  had she lived  but that too is now out of the question  well then  if so  i would ask  whether  in above this year that i have lived with my master  as i am resolved to leave all his gifts behind me  i may not have earned  besides my keeping  these four guineas  and these poor clothes here upon my back  and in my third bundle  now tell me your mind freely  without favour or affection alas  my dear girl  says she  you make me unable to speak to you at all to be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered  for you to leave any of these things behind you  and you must take all your bundles with you  or my master will never forgive you well  well  mrs  jervis  said i  i don t care  i have been too much used to be snubbed and hardly treated by my master  of late  i have done him no harm  and i shall always pray for him and wish him happy  but i don t deserve these things  i know i don t  then  i can t wear them  if i should take them  so they can be of no use to me  and i trust i shall not want the poor pittance  that is all i desire to keep life and soul together  bread and water i can live upon  mrs  jervis  with content water i shall get any where  and if i can t get me bread  i will live like a bird in winter upon hips and haws  and at other times upon pig nuts and potatoes  or turnips  or any thing  so what occasion have i for these things but all i ask is about these four guineas  and if you think i need not return them  that is all i want to know to be sure my dear  you need not  said she  you have well earned them by that waistcoat only  no  i think not so  in that only  but in the linen  and other things  do you think i have  yes  yes  said she  and more  and my keeping allowed for  i mean  said i  and these poor clothes on my back besides  remember that  mrs  jervis  yes  my dear odd one  no doubt you have  well then  said i  i am as happy as a princess  i am quite as rich as i wish to be  and once more  my dear third bundle  i will hug thee to my bosom  and i beg you ll say nothing of all this till i am gone  that my master mayn t be so angry  but that i may go in peace  for my heart without other matters  will be ready to break to part with you all now  mrs  jervis  said i  as to one matter more  and that is my master s last usage of me  before mr  longman said she  pr ythee  dear pamela step to my chamber  and fetch me a paper i left on my table  i have something to shew you in it  i will  said i  and stepped down  but that was only a fetch  to take the orders of my master  i found  it seems he said  he thought two or three times to have burst out upon me  but he could not stand it  and wished i might not know he was there  but i tripped up again so nimbly  for there was no paper  that i just saw his back  as if coming out of that green room  and going into the next to it  the first door that was open i whipped in  and shut the door and bolted it  o mrs  jervis  said i  what have you done by me i see i can t confide in any body  i am beset on all hands  wretched  wretched pamela  where shalt thou expect a friend  if mrs  jervis joins to betray thee thus  she made so many protestations  telling me all  and that he owned i had made him wipe his eyes two or three times  and said she hoped it would have a good effect  and remembered me  that i had said nothing but what would rather move compassion than resentment  that i forgave her  but o  that i was safe from this house  for never poor creature sure was so flustered as i have been so many months together i am called down from this most tedious scribble  i wonder what will next befall your dutiful daughter mrs  jervis says  she is sure i shall have the chariot to carry me home to you  though this will look too great for me  yet it will shew as if i was not turned away quite in disgrace  the travelling chariot is come from lincolnshire  and i fancy i shall go in that  for the other is quite grand letter xxx my dear father and mother i write again  though  may be  i shall bring it to you in my pocket  for i shall have no writing  nor writing time  i hope  when i come to you this is wednesday morning  and i shall  i hope  set out to you to morrow morning  but i have had more trials and more vexations  but of another complexion too a little  though all from the same quarter yesterday my master  after he came from hunting  sent for me  i went with great terror  for i expected he would storm  and be in a fine passion with me for my freedom of speech before  so i was resolved to begin first  with submission  to disarm his anger  and i fell upon my knees as soon as i saw him  and said  good sir  let me beseech you  as you hope to be forgiven yourself  and for the sake of my dear good lady your mother  who recommended me to you with her last words  to forgive me all my faults  and only grant me this favour  the last i shall ask you  that you will let me depart your house with peace and quietness of mind  that i may take such a leave of my dear fellow servants as befits me  and that my heart be not quite broken he took me up  in a kinder manner than ever i had known  and he said shut the door  pamela  and come to me in my closet  i want to have a little serious talk with you  how can i  sir  said i  how can i  and wrung my hands  o pray  sir  let me go out of your presence  i beseech you  by the god that made me  said he  i ll do you no harm  shut the parlour door  and come to me in my library he then went into his closet  which is his library  and full of rich pictures besides  a noble apartment  though called a closet  and next the private garden  into which it has a door that opens  i shut the parlour door  as he bid me  but stood at it irresolute  place some confidence in me  said he  surely you may  when i have spoken thus solemnly  so i crept towards him with trembling feet  and my heart throbbing through my handkerchief  come in  said he  when i bid you  i did so  pray  sir  said i  pity and spare me  i will  said he  as i hope to be saved  he sat down upon a rich settee  and took hold of my hand and said  don t doubt me  pamela  from this moment i will no more consider you as my servant  and i desire you ll not use me with ingratitude for the kindness i am going to express towards you  this a little emboldened me  and he said  holding both my hands between his you have too much wit and good sense not to discover  that i  in spite of my heart  and all the pride of it  cannot but love you  yes  look up to me  my sweet faced girl  i must say i love you  and have put on a behaviour to you  that was much against my heart  in hopes to frighten you from your reservedness  you see i own it ingenuously  and don t play your sex upon me for it i was unable to speak  and he  seeing me too much oppressed with confusion to go on in that strain  said  well  pamela  let me know in what situation of life is your father  i know he is a poor man  but is he as low and as honest as he was when my mother took you then i could speak a little  and with a down look  and i felt my face glow like fire  i said  yes  sir  as poor and as honest too  and that is my pride  says he  i will do something for him  if it be not your fault  and make all your family happy  all  sir  said i  he is happier already than ever he can be  if his daughter s innocence is to be the price of your favour  and i beg you will not speak to me on the only side that can wound me  i have no design of that sort  said he  o sir said i  tell me not so  tell me not so tis easy  said he  for me to be the making of your father  without injuring you  well  sir  said i if this can be done  let me know how  and all i can do with innocence shall be the study and practice of my life but  o  what can such a poor creature as i do  and do my duty said he  i would have you stay a week or fortnight only  and behave yourself with kindness to me  i stoop to beg it of you  and you shall see all shall turn out beyond your expectation  i see  said he  you are going to answer otherwise than i would have you  and i begin to be vexed i should thus meanly sue  and so i will say  that your behaviour before honest longman  when i used you as i did  and you could so well have vindicated yourself  has quite charmed me  and though i am not pleased with all you said yesterday while i was in the closet  yet you have moved me more to admire you than before  and i am awakened to see more worthiness in you  than ever i saw in any lady in the world  all the servants  from the highest to the lowest  doat upon you  instead of envying you  and look upon you in so superior a light  as speaks what you ought to be  i have seen more of your letters than you imagine  this surprised me  and am quite overcome with your charming manner of writing  so free  so easy  and many of your sentiments so much above your years  and your sex  and all put together  makes me  as i tell you  love you to extravagance  now pamela  when i have stooped to acknowledge all this  oblige me only to stay another week or fortnight  to give me time to bring about some certain affairs  and you shall see how much you may find your account in it i trembled to find my poor heart giving way o good sir  said i  spare a poor girl that cannot look up to you  and speak  my heart is full and why should you wish to undo me only oblige me  said he  to stay a fortnight longer  and john shall carry word to your father  that i will see him in the time  either here  or at the swan in his village  o sir said i  my heart will burst  but  on my bended knees  i beg you to let me go to morrow  as i designed  and don t offer to tempt a poor creature  whose whole will would be to do yours  if my virtue would permit i shall permit it  said he  for i intend no injury to you  god is my witness  impossible  said i  i cannot  sir  believe you  after what has passed  how many ways are there to undo poor creatures  good god  protect me this one time  and send me but to my dear father s cot in safety strange  d d fate  said he  that when i speak so solemnly  i can t be believed what should i believe  sir  said i  what can i believe  what have you said  but that i am to stay a fortnight longer  and what then is to become of me my pride of birth and fortune d n them both  said he  since they cannot obtain credit with you  but must add to your suspicions  will not let me descend all at once  and i ask you but a fortnight s stay  that  after this declaration  i may pacify those proud demands upon me o how my heart throbbed  and i began for i did not know what i did  to say the lord s prayer  none of your beads to me pamela  said he  thou art a perfect nun  i think but i said aloud  with my eyes lifted up to heaven  lead me not into temptation  but deliver me from evil  o my good god  he hugged me in his arms  and said  well  my dear girl  then you stay this fortnight  and you shall see what i will do for you i ll leave you a moment  and walk into the next room  to give you time to think of it  and to shew you i have no design upon you  well  this  i thought  did not look amiss he went out  and i was tortured with twenty different doubts in a minute  sometimes i thought that to stay a week or fortnight longer in this house to obey him  while mrs  jervis was with me  could do no great harm  but then  thought i  how do i know what i may be able to do  i have withstood his anger  but may i not relent at his kindness how shall i stand that well  i hope  thought i  by the same protecting grace in which i will always confide but  then  what has he promised why  he will make my poor father and mother s life comfortable  o  said i to myself  that is a rich thought  but let me not dwell upon it  for fear i should indulge it to my ruin what can he do for me  poor girl as i am what can his greatness stoop to  he talks  thought i  of his pride of heart  and pride of condition  o these are in his head  and in his heart too  or he would not confess them to me at such an instant well then  thought i  this can be only to seduce me he has promised nothing but i am to see what he will do  if i stay a fortnight  and this fortnight  thought i again  is no such great matter  and i shall see in a few days how he carries it but then  when i again reflected upon this distance between him and me  and his now open declaration of love  as he called it  and that after this he would talk with me on that subject more plainly than ever  and i shall be less armed  may be to withstand him  and then i bethought myself  why  if he meant no dishonour  he should not speak before mrs  jervis  and the odious frightful closet came again into my head  and my narrow escape upon it and how easy it might be for him to send mrs  jervis and the maids out of the way  and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought about in less than that time  i resolved to go away and trust all to providence  and nothing to myself  and how ought i to be thankful for this resolution as you shall hear but just as i have writ to this place  john sends me word  that he is going this minute your way  and so i will send you so far as i have written  and hope by to morrow night  to ask your blessings  at your own poor  but happy abode  and tell you the rest by word of mouth  and so i rest  till then  and for ever  your dutiful daughter letter xxxi dear father and mother i will continue my writing still  because  may be  i shall like to read it  when i am with you  to see what dangers i have been enabled to escape  and though i bring it along with me i told you my resolution  my happy resolution as i have reason to think it  and just then he came in again  with great kindness in his looks and said  i make no doubt  pamela  you will stay this fortnight to oblige me  i knew not how to frame my words so as to deny  and yet not make him storm  but  said i  forgive  sir  your poor distressed servant i know i cannot possibly deserve any favour at your hands  consistent with virtue  and i beg you will let me go to my poor father  why  said he  thou art the veriest fool that i ever knew  i tell you i will see your father  i ll send for him hither to morrow  in my travelling chariot  if you will  and i ll let him know what i intend to do for him and you  what  sir  may i ask you  can that be  your honour s noble estate may easily make him happy  and not unuseful  perhaps to you  in some respect or other  but what price am i to pay for all this you shall be happy as you can wish  said he  i do assure you  and here i will now give you this purse  in which are fifty guineas  which i will allow your father yearly  and find an employ suitable to his liking  to deserve that and more  pamela  he shall never want  depend upon it i would have given you still more for him  but that  perhaps  you d suspect i intended it as a design upon you o sir  said i  take back your guineas  i will not touch one  nor will my father  i am sure  till he knows what is to be done for them  and particularly what is to become of me  why then  pamela  said he  suppose i find a man of probity and genteel calling  for a husband for you  that shall make you a gentlewoman as long as you live i want no husband  sir  said i  for now i began to see him in all his black colours yet being so much in his power  i thought i would a little dissemble  but  said he  you are so pretty  that go where you will  you can never be free from the designs of some or other of our sex  and i shall think i don t answer the care of my dying mother for you  who committed you to me  if i don t provide you a husband to protect your virtue  and your innocence  and a worthy one i have thought of for you o black  perfidious creature  thought i  what an implement art thou in the hands of lucifer  to ruin the innocent heart yet still i dissembled  for i feared much both him and the place i was in  but whom  pray sir  have you thought of why  said he  young mr  williams my chaplain  in lincolnshire  who will make you happy  does he know sir  said i  any thing of your honour s intentions no  my girl  said he  and kissed me  much against my will  for his very breath was now poison to me  but his dependance upon my favour  and your beauty and merit  will make him rejoice at my kindness to him  well  sir  said i then it is time enough to consider of this matter  and it cannot hinder me from going to my father s  for what will staying a fortnight longer signify to this  your honour s care and goodness may extend to me there as well as here  and mr  williams  and all the world  shall know that i am not ashamed of my father s poverty he would kiss me again  and i said  if i am to think of mr  williams  or any body  i beg you ll not be so free with me  that is not pretty  i m sure  well  said he  but you stay this next fortnight  and in that time i ll have both williams and your father here  for i will have the match concluded in my house  and when i have brought it on  you shall settle it as you please together  meantime take and send only these fifty pieces to your father  as an earnest of my favour  and i ll make you all happy sir  said i  i beg at least two hours to consider of this i shall  said he  be gone out in one hour  and i would have you write to your father what i propose  and john shall carry it on purpose  and he shall take the purse with him for the good old man  if you approve it sir  said i  i will then let you know in one hour my resolution  do so said he  and gave me another kiss  and let me go o how i rejoiced i had got out of his clutches so i write you this that you may see how matters stand  for i am resolved to come away  if possible  base  wicked  treacherous gentleman as he is so here was a trap laid for your poor pamela  i tremble to think of it  o what a scene of wickedness was here laid down for all my wretched life  black hearted wretch  how i hate him for  at first  as you ll see by what i have written  he would have made me believe other things and this of mr  williams  i suppose  came into his head after he walked out from his closet  to give himself time to think how to delude me better  but the covering was now too thin  and easy to be seen through i went to my chamber  and the first thing i did was to write to him  for i thought it was best not to see him again  if i could help it  and i put it under his parlour door  after i had copied it  as follows honoured sir your last proposal to me convinces me  that i ought not to stay  but to go to my father  if it were but to ask his advice about mr  williams and i am so set upon it  that i am not to be persuaded  so  honoured sir  with a thousand thanks for all favours  i will set out to morrow early  and the honour you designed me  as mrs  jervis tells me  of your chariot  there will be no occasion for  because i can hire  i believe farmer brady s chaise  so  begging you will not take it amiss  i shall ever be your dutiful servant as to the purse  sir  my poor father  to be sure  won t forgive me  if i take it  till he can know how to deserve it which is impossible so he has just now sent mrs  jervis to tell me  that since i am resolved to go  go i may  and the travelling chariot shall be ready  but it shall be worse for me  for that he will never trouble himself about me as long as he lives  well  so i get out of the house  i care not  only i should have been glad i could  with innocence  have made you  my dear parents happy i cannot imagine the reason of it  but john  who i thought was gone with my last  is but now going  and he sends to know if i have any thing else to carry  so i break off to send you this with the former i am now preparing for my journey  and about taking leave of my good fellow servants  and if i have not time to write  i must tell you the rest  when i am so happy as to be with you one word more  i slip in a paper of verses  on my going  sad poor stuff but as they come from me  you ll not dislike them  may be  i shewed them to mrs  jervis  and she liked them  and took a copy  and made one sing them to her  and in the green room too  but i looked into the closet first  i will only add  that i am your dutiful daughter let me just say  that he has this moment sent me five guineas by mrs jervis  as a present for my pocket  so i shall be very rich  for as she brought them  i thought i might take them  he says he won t see me  and i may go when i will in the morning  and lincolnshire robin shall drive me  but he is so angry  he orders that nobody shall go out at the door with me  not so much as into the coach yard  well  i can t help it  not i  but does not this expose himself more than me but john waits  and i would have brought this and the other myself  but he says  he has put it up among other things  and so can take both as well as one john is very good  and very honest  i am under great obligations to him i d give him a guinea  now i m so rich  if i thought he d take it  i hear nothing of my lady s clothes  and those my master gave me  for i told mrs  jervis  i would not take them  but i fancy  by a word or two that was dropped  they will be sent after me  dear sirs  what a rich pamela you ll have if they should  but as i can t wear them if they do i don t desire them  and if i have them  will turn them into money  as i can have opportunity  well  no more i m in a fearful hurry   verses on my going away              i   my fellow servants dear  attend   to these few lines  which i have penn d   i m sure they re from your honest friend   and wisher well  poor pamela             ii   i  from a state of low degree   was plac d in this good family   too high a fate for humble me   the helpless  hopeless pamela            iii   yet though my happy lot was so   joyful  i homeward from it go   no less content  when poor and low   than here you find your pamela             iv   for what indeed is happiness   but conscience innocence and peace   and that s a treasure i possess   thank heaven that gave it pamela              v   my future lot i cannot know   but this i m sure  where er i go   whate er i am  whate er i do   i ll be the grateful pamela             vi   no sad regrets my heart annoy   i ll pray for all your peace and joy   from master high  to scullion boy   for all your loves to pamela            vii   one thing or two i ve more to say   god s holy will  be sure  obey   and for our master always pray   as ever shall poor pamela           viii   for  oh  we pity

 as will  i hope  poor pamela             xi   for if asham d i e er could be   of my dear parents  low degree   what lot had been too mean for me   unbless d  unvirtuous pamela            xii   thrice happy may you ever be   each one in his and her degree   and  sirs  whene er you think of me   pray for content to pamela           xiii   pray for her wish d content and peace   and rest assur d she ll never cease   to pray for all your joys increase   while life is lent to pamela            xiv   on god all future good depends   serve him   and so my sonnet ends   with  thank ye  thank ye  honest friends   for all your loves to pamela here it is necessary the reader should know  that the fair pamela s trials were not yet over  but the worst were to come  at a time when she thought them at an end  and that she was returning to her father  for when her master found her virtue was not to be subdued  and he had in vain tried to conquer his passion for her  being a gentleman of pleasure and intrigue  he had ordered his lincolnshire coachman to bring his travelling chariot from thence  not caring to trust his bedfordshire coachman  who  with the rest of the servants  so greatly loved and honoured the fair damsel  and having given him instructions accordingly and prohibited the other servants  on pretence of resenting pamela s behaviour  from accompanying her any part of the road  he drove her five miles on the way to her father s  and then turning off  crossed the country  and carried her onwards toward his lincolnshire estate it is also to be observed  that the messenger of her letters to her father  who so often pretended business that way  was an implement in his master s hands  and employed by him for that purpose  and always gave her letters first to him  and his master used to open and read them  and then send them on  by which means  as he hints to her  as she observes in her letter xxx  he was no stranger to what she wrote  thus every way was the poor virgin beset  and the whole will shew the base arts of designing men to gain their wicked ends  and how much it behoves the fair sex to stand upon their guard against artful contrivances especially when riches and power conspire against innocence and a low estate a few words more will be necessary to make the sequel better understood the intriguing gentleman thought fit  however  to keep back from her father her three last letters  in which she mentions his concealing himself to hear her partitioning out her clothes  his last effort to induce her to stay a fortnight  his pretended proposal of the chaplain and her hopes of speedily seeing them  as also her verses  and to send himself a letter to her father  which is as follows goodman andrews you will wonder to receive a letter from me  but i think i am obliged to let you know  that i have discovered the strange correspondence carried on between you and your daughter  so injurious to my honour and reputation  and which  i think  you should not have encouraged  till you knew there were sufficient grounds for those aspersions  which she so plentifully casts upon me  something possibly there might be in what she has written from time to time  but  believe me  with all her pretended simplicity and innocence  i never knew so much romantic invention as she is mistress of  in short  the girl s head s turned by romances  and such idle stuff  to which she has given herself up  ever since her kind lady s death  and she assumes airs  as if she was a mirror of perfection  and every body had a design upon her don t mistake me  however  i believe her very honest  and very virtuous  but i have found out also  that she is carrying on a sort of correspondence  or love affair  with a young clergyman  that i hope in time to provide for  but who  at present  is destitute of any subsistence but my favour  and what would be the consequence  can you think  of two young folks  who have nothing in the world to trust to of their own to come together with a family multiplying upon them before they have bread to eat for my part  i have too much kindness to them both  not to endeavour to prevent it  if i can  and for this reason i have sent her out of his way for a little while  till i can bring them both to better consideration and i would not  therefore  have you be surprised you don t see your daughter so soon as you might possibly expect yet i do assure you  upon my honour  that she shall be safe and inviolate  and i hope you don t doubt me  notwithstanding any airs she may have given herself  upon my jocular pleasantry to her  and perhaps a little innocent romping with her  so usual with young folks of the two sexes  when they have been long acquainted  and grown up together  for pride is not my talent as she is a mighty letter writer  i hope she has had the duty to apprise you of her intrigue with the young clergyman  and i know not whether it meets with your countenance  but now she is absent for a little while  for i know he would have followed her to your village if she had gone home  and there  perhaps  they would have ruined one another  by marrying  i doubt not i shall bring him to see his interest  and that he engages not before he knows how to provide for a wife  and when that can be done  let them come together in god s name for me i expect not to be answered on this head  but by your good opinion  and the confidence you may repose in my honour  being                                    your hearty friend to serve you p  s  i find my man john has been the manager of the correspondence  in which such liberties have been taken with me  i shall soon  in a manner that becomes me  let the saucy fellow know how much i resent his part of the affair  it is hard thing  that a man of my character in the world should be used thus freely by his own servants it is easy to guess at the poor old man s concern  upon reading this letter from a gentleman of so much consideration  he knew not what course to take  and had no manner of doubt of his poor daughter s innocence  and that foul play was designed her  yet he sometimes hoped the best  and was ready to believe the surmised correspondence between the clergyman and her  having not received the letters she wrote  which would have cleared up that affair but  after all  he resolved  as well to quiet his own as her mother s uneasiness  to undertake a journey to the squire s  and leaving his poor wife to excuse him to the farmer who employed him  he set out that very evening  late as it was  and travelling all night  found himself soon after day light  at the gate of the gentleman  before the family was up  and there he sat down to rest himself till he should see somebody stirring the grooms were the first he saw  coming out to water their horses  and he asked  in so distressful a manner  what was become of pamela  that they thought him crazy  and said  why  what have you to do with pamela old fellow  get out of the horses  way where is your master  said the poor man  pray  gentlemen  don t be angry  my heart s almost broken he never gives any thing at the door  i assure you  says one of the grooms so you lose your labour  i am not a beggar yet  said the poor old man  i want nothing of him  but my pamela o my child  my child i ll be hanged  says one of them  if this is not mrs  pamela s father indeed  indeed  said he  wringing his hands  i am  and weeping where is my child  where is my pamela why  father  said one of them we beg your pardon  but she is gone home to you  how long have you been come from home o  but last night  said he  i have travelled all night is the squire at home  or is he not yes  but he is not stirring though  said the groom  as yet  thank god for that  said he  thank god for that  then i hope i may be permitted to speak to him anon  they asked him to go in  and he stepped into the stable  and sat down on the stairs there  wiping his eyes  and sighing so sadly  that it grieved the servants to hear him the family was soon raised with a report of pamela s father coming to inquire after his daughter  and the maids would fain have had him go into the kitchen  but mrs  jervis  having been told of his coming arose  and hastened down to her parlour  and took him in with her  and there heard all his sad story  and read the letter  she wept bitterly but yet endeavoured  before him  to hide her concern  and said  well goodman andrews  i cannot help weeping at your grief  but i hope there is no occasion  let nobody see this letter  whatever you do  i dare say your daughter is safe well  but  said he  i see you  madam  know nothing about her if all was right  so good a gentlewoman as you are  would not have been a stranger to this  to be sure you thought she was with me said she  my master does not always inform his servants of his proceedings  but you need not doubt his honour  you have his hand for it  and you may see he can have no design upon her  because he is not from hence  and does not talk of going hence  o that is all i have to hope for  said he  that is all  indeed but  said he and was going on when the report of his coming had reached the squire  who came down in his morning gown and slippers  into the parlour  where he and mrs jervis were talking what s the matter  goodman andrews  said he  what s the matter  oh my child  said the good old man  give me my child  i beseech you why  i thought  says the squire  that i had satisfied you about her  sure you have not the letter i sent you  written with my own hand  yes  yes  but i have  sir  said he  and that brought me hither  and i have walked all night  poor man  returned he  with great seeming compassion  i am sorry for it truly  why  your daughter has made a strange racket in my family and if i thought it would have disturbed you so much  i would have e en let her go home  but what i did was to serve her  and you too  she is very safe  i do assure you  goodman andrews  and you may take my honour for it  i would not injure her for the world  do you think i would  mrs jervis  no  i hope not  sir  said she hope not  said the poor man  so do i  but pray  sir  give me my child  that is all i desire  and i ll take care no clergyman shall come near her why  london is a great way off  said the squire  and i can t send for her back presently  what  then  said he  have you sent my poor pamela to london  i would not have said it so  replied the squire  but i assure you  upon my honour  she is quite safe and satisfied  and will quickly inform you of it by letter  she is in a reputable family  no less than a bishop s  and is to wait on his lady  till i get the matter over that i mentioned to you o how shall i know this  replied he what  said the squire  pretending anger  am i to be doubted do you believe i can have any view upon your daughter  and if i had  do you think i would take such methods as these to effect it  why  surely  man  thou forgettest whom thou talkest to o  sir  said he  i beg your pardon  but consider my dear child is in the case  let me but know what bishop  and where  and i will travel to london on foot  to see my daughter  and then be satisfied why  goodman andrews  i think thou hast read romances as well as thy daughter  and thy head s turned with them  may i have not my word taken do you think  once more  i would offer any thing dishonourable to your daughter  is there any thing looks like it pr ythee  man  recollect a little who i am  and if i am not to be believed  what signifies talking why  sir  said he  pray forgive me  but there is no harm to say  what bishop s  or whereabouts  what  and so you d go troubling his lordship with your impertinent fears and stories  will you be satisfied  if you have a letter from her within a week  it may be less  if she be not negligent  to assure you all is well with her  why that  said the poor man  will be some comfort  well then  said the gentleman  i can t answer for her negligence  if she don t write  and if she should send a letter to you  mrs  jervis  for i desire not to see it  i have had trouble enough about her already  be sure you send it by a man and horse the moment you receive it  to be sure i will  answered she  thank your honour  said the good man  and then i must wait with as much patience as i can for a week  which will be a year to me i tell you  said the gentleman  it must be her own fault if she don t write  for tis what i insisted upon  for my own reputation  and i shan t stir from this house  i assure you  till she is heard from  and that to your satisfaction  god bless your honour  said the poor man  as you say and mean truth  amen  amen  goodman andrews  said he  you see i am not afraid to say amen  so  mrs  jervis  make the good man as welcome as you can  and let me have no uproar about the matter he then  whispering her  bid her give him a couple of guineas to bear his charges home  telling him  he should be welcome to stay there till the letter came  if he would  and be a witness  that he intended honourably  and not to stir from his house for one while the poor old man staid and dined with mrs  jervis  with some tolerable ease of mind  in hopes to hear from his beloved daughter in a few days and then accepting the present  returned for his own house  and resolved to be as patient as possible meantime mrs  jervis  and all the family  were in the utmost grief for the trick put upon the poor pamela  and she and the steward represented it to their master in as moving terms as they durst  but were forced to rest satisfied with his general assurances of intending her no harm which  however  mrs  jervis little believed  from the pretence he had made in his letter  of the correspondence between pamela and the young parson  which she knew to be all mere invention  though she durst not say so but the week after  they were made a little more easy by the following letter brought by an unknown hand  and left for mrs  jervis  which  how procured  will be shewn in the sequel dear mrs  jervis i have been vilely tricked  and  instead of being driven by robin to my dear father s  i am carried off  to where  i have no liberty to tell however  i am at present not used hardly  in the main  and write to beg of you to let my dear father and mother whose hearts must be well nigh broken  know that i am well  and that i am  and  by the grace of god ever will he  their honest  as well as dutiful daughter  and                                   your obliged friend                                                  pamela andrews i must neither send date nor place  but have most solemn assurances of honourable usage  this is the only time my low estate has been troublesome to me  since it has subjected me to the frights i have undergone  love to your good self  and all my dear fellow servants adieu  adieu  but pray for poor pamela this  though it quieted not entirely their apprehensions  was shewn to the whole family  and to the gentleman himself  who pretended not to know how it came  and mrs  jervis sent it away to the good old folks who at first suspected it was forged  and not their daughter s hand but  finding the contrary  they were a little easier to hear she was alive and honest  and having inquired of all their acquaintance what could be done  and no one being able to put them in a way how to proceed  with effect  on so extraordinary an occasion  against so rich and so resolute a gentleman  and being afraid to make matters worse though they saw plainly enough  that she was in no bishop s family and so mistrusted all the rest of his story  they applied themselves to prayers for their poor daughter  and for an happy issue to an affair that almost distracted them we shall now leave the honest old pair praying for their dear pamela and return to the account she herself gives of all this  having written it journal wise  to amuse and employ her time  in hopes some opportunity might offer to send it to her friends  and  as was her constant view that she might afterwards thankfully look back upon the dangers she had escaped  when they should be happily overblown  as in time she hoped they would be  and that then she might examine  and either approve or repent of her own conduct in them letter xxxii o my dearest father and mother let me write  and bewail my miserable hard fate  though i have no hope how what i write can be conveyed to your hands i have now nothing to do  but write and weep  and fear and pray  but yet what can i hope for when i seem to be devoted  as a victim to the will of a wicked violator of all the laws of god and man but  gracious heaven  forgive me my rashness and despondency  o let me not sin against thee  for thou best knowest what is fittest for thy poor handmaid and as thou sufferest not thy poor creatures to be tempted above what they can bear  i will resign myself to thy good pleasure  and still  i hope  desperate as my condition seems  that as these trials are not of my own seeking  nor the effects of my presumption and vanity  i shall be enabled to overcome them  and  in god s own good time  be delivered from them thus do i pray imperfectly  as i am forced by my distracting fears and apprehensions  and o join with me  my dear parents but  alas  how can you know  how can i reveal to you  the dreadful situation of your poor daughter  the unhappy pamela may be undone which god forbid  and sooner deprive me of life  before you can know her hard lot o the unparalleled wickedness  stratagems  and devices  of those who call themselves gentlemen  yet pervert the design of providence  in giving them ample means to do good  to their own everlasting perdition and the ruin of poor oppressed innocence but now i will tell you what has befallen me  and yet  how shall you receive it  here is no honest john to carry my letters to you  and besides  i am watched in all my steps  and no doubt shall be  till my hard fate may ripen his wicked projects for my ruin  i will every day however  write my sad state  and some way  perhaps  may be opened to send the melancholy scribble to you  but  alas  when you know it  what will it do but aggravate your troubles  for  o  what can the abject poor do against the mighty rich  when they are determined to oppress well  but i must proceed to write what i had hoped to tell you in a few hours  when i believed i should receive your grateful blessings  on my return to you from so many hardships i will begin with my account from the last letter i wrote you  in which i enclosed my poor stuff of verses  and continue it at times  as i have opportunity  though  as i said  i know not how it can reach you the long hoped for thursday morning came  when i was to set out  i had taken my leave of my fellow servants overnight  and a mournful leave it was to us all  for men  as well as women servants  wept much to part with me  and  for my part  i was overwhelmed with tears  and the affecting instances of their esteem  they all would have made me little presents  as tokens of their love  but i would not take any thing from the lower servants  to be sure  but mr  longman would have me accept of several yards of holland  and a silver snuff box  and a gold ring  which he desired me to keep for his sake  and he wept over me  but said  i am sure so good a maiden god will bless  and though you return to your poor father again  and his low estate  yet providence will find you out remember i tell you so  and one day  though i mayn t live to see it  you will be rewarded i said  o  dear mr  longman  you make me too rich  and too mody  and yet i must be a beggar before my time for i shall want often to be scribbling  little thinking it would be my only employment so soon and i will beg you  sir  to favour me with some paper  and  as soon as i get home  i will write you a letter  to thank you for all your kindness to me  and a letter to good mrs  jervis too this was lucky  for i should have had none else  but at the pleasure of my rough natured governess  as i may call her  but now i can write to ease my mind  though i can t send it to you  and write what i please for she knows not how well i am provided  for good mr  longman gave me above forty sheets of paper  and a dozen pens  and a little phial of ink  which last i wrapped in paper  and put in my pocket  and some wax and wafers o dear sir  said i  you have set me up  how shall i requite you  he said  by a kiss  my fair mistress  and i gave it very willingly  for he is a good old man rachel and hannah cried sadly  when i took my leave  and jane  who sometimes used to be a little crossish  and cicely too  wept sadly  and said  they would pray for me  but poor jane  i doubt  will forget that for she seldom says her prayers for herself  more s the pity then arthur the gardener  our robin the coachman  and lincolnshire robin too  who was to carry me  were very civil  and both had tears in their eyes  which i thought then very good natured in lincolnshire robin because he knew but little of me but since  i find he might well be concerned  for he had then his instructions  it seems  and knew how he was to be a means to entrap me then our other three footmen  harry  isaac  and benjamin  and grooms and helpers  were very much affected likewise  and the poor little scullion boy  tommy  was ready to run over for grief they had got all together over night  expecting to be differently employed in the morning  and they all begged to shake hands with me  and i kissed the maidens  and prayed to god to bless them all  and thanked them for all their love and kindness to me  and  indeed  i was forced to leave them sooner than i would  because i could not stand it  indeed i could not  harry i could not have thought it  for he is a little wildish  they say  cried till he sobbed again  john  poor honest john was not then come back from you  but as for the butler  mr  jonathan  he could not stay in company i thought to have told you a deal about this  but i have worse things to employ my thoughts mrs  jervis  good mrs  jervis  cried all night long  and i comforted her all i could  and she made me promise  that if my master went to london to attend parliament  or to lincolnshire  i would come and stay a week with her  and she would have given me money  but i would not take it well  next morning came  and i wondered i saw nothing of poor honest john  for i waited to take leave of him  and thank him for all his civilities to me and to you  but i suppose he was sent farther by my master  and so could not return  and i desired to be remembered to him and when mrs  jervis told me  with a sad heart  the chariot was ready with four horses to it  i was just upon sinking into the ground  though i wanted to be with you my master was above stairs  and never asked to see me  i was glad of it in the main  but he knew  false heart as he is  that i was not to be out of his reach o preserve me  heaven  from his power  and from his wickedness well  they were not suffered to go with me one step  as i writ to you before  for he stood at the window to see me go  and in the passage to the gate  out of his sight  there they stood all of them  in two rows and we could say nothing on both sides  but god bless you  and god bless you  but harry carried my own bundle  my third bundle  as i was used to call it  to the coach  with some plumb cake  and diet bread  made for me over night  and some sweet meats  and six bottles of canary wine  which mrs  jervis would make me take in a basket  to cheer our hearts now and then  when we got together  as she said  and i kissed all the maids again  and shook hands with the men again  but mr  jonathan and mr longman were not there  and then i tripped down the steps to the chariot  mrs  jervis crying most sadly i looked up when i got to the chariot  and i saw my master at the window  in his gown  and i courtesied three times to him very low  and prayed for him with my hands lifted up  for i could not speak  indeed i was not able  and he bowed his head to me  which made me then very glad he would take such notice of me  and in i stepped  and was ready to burst with grief  and could only  till robin began to drive  wave my white handkerchief to them  wet with my tears  and  at last  away he drove  jehu like  as they say  out of the court yard  and i too soon found i had cause for greater and deeper grief well  said i to myself  at this rate i shall soon be with my dear father and mother  and till i had got  as i supposed  half way  i thought of the good friends i had left  and when  on stopping for a little bait to the horses  robin told me i was near half way  i thought it was high time to wipe my eyes  and think to whom i was going  as then  alack for me  i thought  so i began to ponder what a meeting i should have with you  how glad you d both be to see me come safe and innocent to you after all my dangers  and so i began to comfort myself  and to banish the other gloomy side from my mind  though  too  it returned now and then  for i should be ungrateful not to love them for their love well  i believe i set out about eight o clock in the morning  and i wondered and wondered  when it was about two  as i saw by a church dial in a little village as we passed through  that i was still more and more out of my knowledge  hey day  thought i  to drive this strange pace  and to be so long a going a little more than twenty miles  is very odd  but to be sure  thought i  robin knows the way at last he stopped  and looked about him  as if he was at a loss for the road  and i said  mr  robert  sure you are out of the way i m afraid i am  said he  but it can t be much  i ll ask the first person i see  pray do  said i  and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay  and i gave him some cake  and two glasses of canary wine  and stopt about half an hour in all  then he drove on very fast again i had so much to think of  of the dangers i now doubted not i had escaped  of the loving friends i had left  and my best friends i was going to  and the many things i had to relate to you  that i the less thought of the way  till i was startled out of my meditations by the sun beginning to set  and still the man driving on  and his horses sweating and foaming  and then i began to be alarmed all at once  and called to him  and he said he had horrid ill luck  for he had come several miles out of the way  but was now right  and should get in still before it was quite dark  my heart began then to misgive me a little  and i was very much fatigued  for i had no sleep for several nights before  to signify and at last i said  pray mr  robert  there is a town before us  what do you call it if we are so much out of the way  we had better put up there  for the night comes on apace  and  lord protect me  thought i i shall have new dangers  mayhap  to encounter with the man  who have escaped the master little thinking of the base contrivance of the latter says he  i am just there  tis but a mile on one side of the town before us nay  said i  i may be mistaken  for it is a good while since i was this way  but i am sure the face of the country here is nothing like what i remember it he pretended to be much out of humour with himself for mistaking the way  and at last stopped at a farmhouse  about two miles beyond the village i had seen  and it was then almost dark  and he alighted  and said  we must make shift here  for i am quite out lord  thought i  be good to the poor pamela  more trials still what will befall me next the farmer s wife  and maid  and daughter  came out  and the wife said what brings you this way at this time of night  mr  robert  and with a lady too then i began to be frightened out of my wits  and laying middle and both ends together  i fell a crying  and said  god give me patience  i am undone for certain pray  mistress  said i  do you know squire b  of bedfordshire the wicked coachman would have prevented the answering me  but the simple daughter said  know his worship  yes  surely  why he is my father s landlord well  said i  then i am undone  undone for ever o wicked wretch  what have i done to you  said i to the coachman  to serve me thus vile tool of a wicked master faith  said the fellow  i am sorry this task was put upon me  but i could not help it  but make the best of it now  here are very civil reputable folks  and you ll be safe here  i ll assure you let me get out  said i  and i ll walk back to the town we came through  late as it is for i will not enter here said the farmer s wife  you ll be very well used here  i ll assure you young gentlewoman  and have better conveniences than any where in the village  i matter not conveniences  said i  i am betrayed and undone as you have a daughter of your own  pity me  and let me know if your landlord  as you call him  be here no  i ll assure you he is not  said she and then came the farmer  a good like sort of man  grave  and well behaved  and spoke to me in such sort  as made me a little pacified  and seeing no help for it  i went in  and the wife immediately conducted me up stairs to the best apartment  and told me  that was mine as long as i staid  and nobody should come near me but when i called i threw myself on the bed in the room  tired and frightened to death almost  and gave way to the most excessive fit of grief that i ever had the daughter came up  and said  mr  robert had given her a letter to give me  and there it was  i raised myself  and saw it was the hand and seal of the wicked wretch  my master  directed to mrs  pamela andrews this was a little better than to have him here  though  if he had  he must have been brought through the air  for i thought i was the good woman for i began to see things about a little reputable  and no guile appearing in them  but rather a face of grief for my grief offered me a glass of some cordial water  which i accepted  for i was ready to sink  and then i sat up in a chair a little  though very faintish  and they brought me two candles  and lighted a brushwood fire and said  if i called  i should be waited on instantly  and so left me to ruminate on my sad condition  and to read my letter  which i was not able to do presently  after i had a little come to myself  i found it to contain these words dear pamela the passion i have for you  and your obstinacy  have constrained me to act by you in a manner that i know will occasion you great trouble and fatigue  both of mind and body  yet  forgive me  my dear girl  for although i have taken this step  i will  by all that s good and holy  use you honourably  suffer not your fears to transport you to a behaviour that will be disreputable to us both  for the place where you ll receive this  is a farm that belongs to me  and the people civil honest  and obliging you will  by this time  be far on your way to the place i have allotted for your abode for a few weeks  till i have managed some affairs  that will make me shew myself to you in a much different light  than you may possibly apprehend from this rash action  and to convince you  that i mean no harm  i do assure you  that the house you are going to  shall be so much at your command  that even i myself will not approach it without leave from you  so make yourself easy  be discreet and prudent  and a happier turn shall reward these your troubles  than you may at present apprehend meantime i pity the fatigue you will have  if this come to your hand in the place i have directed  and will write to your father to satisfy him that nothing but what is honourable shall be offered to you  by                your passionate admirer  so i must style myself                                                      don t think hardly of poor robin  you have so possessed all my servants in your favour  that i find they had rather serve you than me  and tis reluctantly the poor fellow undertook this task  and i was forced to submit to assure him of my honourable intentions to you  which i am fully resolved to make good  if you compel me not to a contrary conduct i but too well apprehended that the letter was only to pacify me for the present  but as my danger was not so immediate as i had reason to dread and he had promised to forbear coming to me  and to write to you  my dear parents  to quiet your concern  i was a little more easy than before and i made shift to eat a little bit of boiled chicken they had got for me  and drank a glass of my sack  and made each of them do so too but after i had so done  i was again a little flustered  for in came the coachman with the look of a hangman  i thought  and madamed me up strangely  telling me  he would beg me to get ready to pursue my journey by five in the morning  or else he should be late in  i was quite grieved at this  for i began not to dislike my company  considering how things stood  and was in hopes to get a party among them  and so to put myself into any worthy protection in the neighbourhood  rather than go forward when he withdrew  i began to tamper with the farmer and his wife  but alas  they had had a letter delivered them at the same time i had  so securely had lucifer put it into his head to do his work  and they only shook their heads  and seemed to pity me  and so i was forced to give over that hope however  the good farmer shewed me his letter  which i copied as follows  for it discovers the deep arts of this wicked master  and how resolved he seems to be on my ruin  by the pains he took to deprive me of all hopes of freeing myself from his power farmer norton i send to your house  for one night only  a young gentlewoman  much against her will  who has deeply embarked in a love affair  which will be her ruin  as well as the person s to whom she wants to betroth herself  i have  to oblige her father  ordered her to be carried to one of my houses  where she will be well used  to try  if by absence  and expostulation with both  they can be brought to know their own interest and i am sure you will use her kindly for my sake  for  excepting this matter  which she will not own  she does not want prudence and discretion  i will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this matter the first opportunity  and am                               your friend and servant he had said  too cunningly for me  that i would not own this pretended love affair  so that he had provided them not to believe me  say what i would  and as they were his tenants  who all love him  for he has some amiable qualities  and so he had need  i saw all my plot cut out  and so was forced to say the less i wept bitterly  however  for i found he was too hard for me  as well in his contrivances as riches  and so had recourse again to my only refuge comforting myself  that god never fails to take the innocent heart into his protection  and is alone able to baffle and confound the devices of the mighty  nay  the farmer was so prepossessed with the contents of his letter  that he began to praise his care and concern for me  and to advise me against entertaining addresses without my friends  advice and consent  and made me the subject of a lesson for his daughter s improvement  so i was glad to shut up this discourse  for i saw i was not likely to be believed i sent  however  to tell my driver  that i was so fatigued  i could not get out so soon the next morning  but he insisted upon it  and said it would make my day s journey the lighter  and i found he was a more faithful servant to his master  notwithstanding what he wrote of his reluctance  than i could have wished  i saw still more and more  that all was deep dissimulation  and contrivance worse and worse indeed i might have shewn them his letter to me  as a full confutation of his to them  but i saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf and so thought it signified little  as i was to go away so soon  to enter more particularly into the matter with them  and besides  i saw they were not inclinable to let me stay longer  for fear of disobliging him so i went to bed  but had very little rest  and they would make their servant maid bear me company in the chariot five miles  early in the morning  and she was to walk hack i had contrived in my thoughts  when i was on my way in the chariot  on friday morning  that when we came into some town to bait  as he must do for the horses  sake  i would  at the inn  apply myself  if i saw i any way could  to the mistress of the inn  and tell her the case  and to refuse to go farther  having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend with well  i was very full of this project  and in great hopes  some how or other  to extricate myself in this way  but  oh  the artful wretch had provided for even this last refuge of mine  for when we came to put up at a large town on the way  to eat a morsel for dinner  and i was fully resolved to execute my project  who should be at the inn that he put up at  but the wicked mrs  jewkes  expecting me  and her sister in law was the mistress of it  and she had provided a little entertainment for me and this i found  when i desired  as soon as i came in  to speak with the mistress of the house  she came to me  and i said  i am a poor unhappy young body  that want your advice and assistance  and you seem to be a good sort of a gentlewoman  that would assist an oppressed innocent person  yes  madam  said she  i hope you guess right  and i have the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak pray call my sister jewkes jewkes  jewkes  thought i  i have heard of that name  i don t like it then the wicked creature appeared  whom i had never seen but once before  and i was terrified out of my wits  no stratagem  thought i  not one  for a poor innocent girl  but every thing to turn out against me that is hard indeed so i began to pull in my horns  as they say  for i saw i was now worse off than at the farmer s the naughty woman came up to me with an air of confidence  and kissed me  see  sister  said she  here s a charming creature  would she not tempt the best lord in the land to run away with her  o frightful thought i  here s an avowal of the matter at once  i am now gone  that s certain  and so was quite silent and confounded  and seeing no help for it  for she would not part with me out of her sight  i was forced to set out with her in the chariot for she came thither on horseback  with a man servant  who rode by us the rest of the way  leading her horse and now i gave over all thoughts of redemption  and was in a desponding condition indeed well  thought i  here are strange pains taken to ruin a poor innocent helpless  and even worthless young body  this plot is laid too deep and has been too long hatching  to be baffled  i fear  but then i put my trust in god  who i knew was able to do every thing for me  when all other possible means should fail  and in him i was resolved to confide you may see yet  oh  that kills me  for i know not whether ever you can see what i now write or no else you will see what sort of woman that mrs  jewkes is  compared to good mrs  jervis  by this every now and then she would be staring in my face  in the chariot  and squeezing my hand  and saying  why  you are very pretty  my silent dear and once she offered to kiss me  but i said  i don t like this sort of carriage  mrs  jewkes  it is not like two persons of one sex  she fell a laughing very confidently  and said  that s prettily said  i vow  then thou hadst rather be kissed by the other sex  i fackins  i commend thee for that i was sadly teased with her impertinence  and bold way  but no wonder she was innkeeper s housekeeper  before she came to my master  and those sort of creatures don t want confidence  you know  and indeed she made nothing to talk boldly on twenty occasions  and said two or three times when she saw the tears every now and then  as we rid  trickle down my cheeks  i was sorely hurt  truly  to have the handsomest and finest young gentleman in five counties in love with me so i find i am got into the hands of a wicked procuress  and if i was not safe with good mrs  jervis  and where every body loved me  what a dreadful prospect have i now before me  in the hands of a woman that seems to delight in filthiness o dear sirs  what shall i do  what shall i do surely  i shall never be equal to all these things about eight at night  we entered the court yard of this handsome  large old  and lonely mansion  that looks made for solitude and mischief  as i thought  by its appearance  with all its brown nodding horrors of lofty elms and pines about it  and here  said i to myself  i fear  is to be the scene of my ruin  unless god protect me  who is all sufficient i was very sick at entering it  partly from fatigue  and partly from dejection of spirits  and mrs  jewkes got me some mulled wine  and seemed mighty officious to welcome me thither  and while she was absent ordering the wine  the wicked robin came in to me  and said  i beg a thousand pardons for my part in this affair  since i see your grief and your distress  and i do assure you  that i am sorry it fell to my task mighty well  mr  robert  said i  i never saw an execution but once  and then the hangman asked the poor creature s pardon  and wiped his mouth as you do  and pleaded his duty  and then calmly tucked up the criminal but i am no criminal  as you all know  and if i could have thought it my duty to obey a wicked master in his unlawful command  i had saved you all the merit of this vile service i am sorry  said he  you take it so  but every body don t think alike well  said i  you have done your part  mr  robert  towards my ruin  very faithfully  and will have cause to be sorry  may be  at the long run when you shall see the mischief that comes of it your eyes were open  and you knew i was to be carried to my father s  and that i was barbarously tricked and betrayed  and i can only  once more  thank you for your part of it  god forgive you so he went away a little sad  what have you said to robin  madam  said mrs  jewkes  who came in as he went out  the poor fellow s ready to cry  i need not be afraid of your following his example  mrs  jewkes said i  i have been telling him  that he has done his part to my ruin and he now can t help it  so his repentance does me no good  i wish it may him  i ll assure you  madam  said she  i should be as ready to cry as he  if i should do you any harm  it is not in his power to help it now  said i  but your part is to come  and you may choose whether you ll contribute to my ruin or not why  look ye  madam  said she  i have a great notion of doing my duty to my master  and therefore you may depend upon it  if i can do that  and serve you  i will  but you must think  if your desire  and his will  come to clash once  i shall do as he bids me let it be what it will pray  mrs  jewkes  said i  don t madam me so  i am but a silly poor girl  set up by the gambol of fortune  for a may game  and now am to be something  and now nothing  just as that thinks fit to sport with me  and let you and me talk upon a foot together  for i am a servant inferior to you  and so much the more  as i am turned out of place ay  ay  says she  i understand something of the matter  you have so great power over my master  that you may soon be mistress of us all  and so i would oblige you  if i could  and i must and will call you madam for i am instructed to shew you all respect  i ll assure you who instructed you so to do  said i  who  my master  to be sure  said she  why  said i  how can that be  you have not seen him lately  no that s true  said she  but i have been expecting you here some time  o the deep laid wickedness  thought i  and  besides  i have a letter of instructions by robin  but  may be  i should not have said so much  if you would shew them to me  said i  i should be able to judge how far i could  or could not  expect favour from you  consistent with your duty to our master  i beg your pardon  fair mistress  for that  said she  i am sufficiently instructed  and you may depend upon it  i will observe my orders  and  so far as they will let me  so far will i oblige you and there s an end of it well  said i  you will not  i hope  do an unlawful or wicked thing  for any master in the world  look ye  said she  he is my master  and if he bids me do any thing that i can do  i think i ought to do it  and let him  who has his power to command me  look to the lawfulness of it why  said i  suppose he should bid you cut my throat  would you do it there s no danger of that  said she  but to be sure i would not  for then i should be hanged  for that would be murder  well  said i  and suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature  and ruin her  would you assist him in that  for to rob a person of her virtue is worse than cutting her throat why now  says she  how strangely you talk  are not the two sexes made for one another  and is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty woman  and suppose he can obtain his desires  is that so bad as cutting her throat  and then the wretch fell a laughing  and talked most impertinently  and shewed me  that i had nothing to expect from her virtue or conscience  and this gave me great mortification  for i was in hopes of working upon her by degrees so we ended our discourse here  and i bid her shew me where i must lie why  said she  lie where you list  madam  i can tell you  i must lie with you for the present  for the present  said i  and torture then wrung my heart but is it in your instructions  that you must lie with me  yes  indeed  said she i am sorry for it  said i  why  said she i am wholesome  and cleanly too  i ll assure you  yes  said i  i don t doubt that  but i love to lie by myself  how so  said she  was not mrs jervis your bed fellow at t other house well  said i  quite sick of her  and my condition  you must do as you are instructed  i think  i can t help myself  and am a most miserable creature  she repeated her insufferable nonsense  mighty miserable indeed  to be so well beloved by one of the finest gentlemen in england i am now come down in my writing to this present saturday  and a deal i have written my wicked bed fellow has very punctual orders  it seems  for she locks me and herself in  and ties the two keys for there is a double door to the room  about her wrist  when she goes to bed  she talks of the house having been attempted to be broken open two or three times  whether to fright me  i can t tell  but it makes me fearful  though not so much as i should be  if i had not other and greater fears i slept but little last night  and got up  and pretended to sit by the window  which looks into the spacious gardens  but i was writing all the time  from break of day  to her getting up  and after  when she was absent at breakfast she presented the two maids to me  the cook and house maid poor awkward souls  that i can see no hopes of  they seem so devoted to her and ignorance  yet i am resolved  if possible  to find some way to escape  before this wicked master comes there are  besides  of servants  the coachman  robert  a groom  a helper  a footman  all but robert  and he is accessary to my ruin strange creatures  that promise nothing  and all likewise devoted to this woman  the gardener looks like a good honest man  but he is kept at a distance  and seems reserved i wondered i saw not mr  williams the clergyman  but would not ask after him  apprehending it might give some jealousy  but when i had beheld the rest  he was the only one i had hopes of  for i thought his cloth would set him above assisting in my ruin but in the afternoon he came  for it seems he has a little latin school in the neighbouring village  which he attends  and this brings him in a little matter  additional to my master s favour  till something better falls  of which he has hopes he is a sensible sober young gentleman  and when i saw him i confirmed myself in my hopes of him  for he seemed to take great notice of my distress and grief  for i could not hide it  though he appeared fearful of mrs  jewkes  who watched all our motions and words he has an apartment in the house  but is mostly at a lodging in the town  for a conveniency of his little school  only on saturday afternoon and sundays  and he preaches sometimes for the minister of the village which is about three miles off i hope to go to church with him to morrow  sure it is not in her instructions to deny me  he can t have thought of every thing  and something may strike out for me there i have asked her  for a feint  because she shan t think i am so well provided  to indulge me with pen and ink  though i have been using my own so freely when her absence would let me  for i begged to be left to myself as much as possible  she says she will let me have it  but then i must promise not to send any writing out of the house  without her seeing it  i said  it was only to divert my grief when i was by myself as i desired to be  for i loved writing as well as reading  but i had nobody to send to  she knew well enough no  not at present  may be  said she  but i am told you are a great writer  and it is in my instructions to see all you write  so  look you here  said she  i will let you have a pen and ink  and two sheets of paper  for this employment will keep you out of worse thoughts  but i must see them always when i ask  written or not written  that s very hard  said i  but may i not have to myself the closet in the room where we lie  with the key to lock up my things  i believe i may consent to that  said she  and i will set it in order for you  and leave the key in the door  and there is a spinnet too  said she  if it be in tune  you may play to divert you now and then  for i know my old lady learnt you and below is my master s library  you may take out what books you will and  indeed  these and my writing will be all my amusement  for i have no work given me to do  and the spinnet  if in tune  will not find my mind  i am sure  in tune to play upon it  but i went directly and picked out some books from the library  with which i filled a shelf in the closet she gave me possession of  and from these i hope to receive improvement  as well as amusement  but no sooner was her back turned than i set about hiding a pen of my own here  and another there  for fear i should come to be denied  and a little of my ink in a broken china cup  and a little in another cup  and a sheet of paper here and there among my linen  with a little of the wax  and a few wafers  in several places  lest i should be searched  and something  i thought might happen to open a way for my deliverance  by these or some other means  o the pride  thought i  i shall have  if i can secure my innocence  and escape the artful wiles of this wicked master  for  if he comes hither  i am undone  to be sure  for this naughty woman will assist him  rather than fail  in the worst of his attempts  and he ll have no occasion to send her out of the way  as he would have done mrs jervis once  so i must set all my little wits at work it is a grief to me to write  and not to be able to send to you what i write  but now it is all the diversion i have  and if god will favour my escape with my innocence  as i trust he graciously will  for all these black prospects  with what pleasure shall i read them afterwards i was going to say  pray for your dutiful daughter  as i used  but alas  you cannot know my distress  though i am sure i have your prayers and i will write on as things happen  that if a way should open  my scribble may be ready to be sent  for what i do  must be at a jerk  to be sure o how i want such an obliging honest hearted man as john i am now come to sunday well  here is a sad thing  i am denied by this barbarous woman to go to church  as i had built upon i might  and she has huffed poor mr williams all to pieces  for pleading for me  i find he is to be forbid the house  if she pleases  poor gentleman  all his dependance is upon my master  who has a very good living for him  if the incumbent die  and he has kept his bed these four months  of old age and dropsy he pays me great respect  and i see pities me  and would  perhaps assist my escape from these dangers  but i have nobody to plead for me and why should i wish to ruin a poor gentleman  by engaging him against his interest  yet one would do any thing to preserve one s innocence and providence would  perhaps  make it up to him o judge but how shall you see what i write  of my distracted condition  to be reduced to such a pass as to a desire to lay traps for mankind  but he wants sadly to say something to me  as he whisperingly hinted the wretch i think i will always call her the wretch henceforth  abuses me more and more  i was but talking to one of the maids just now indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees  and she popt upon us and said nay  madam  don t offer to tempt poor innocent country maidens from doing their duty  you wanted  i hear  she should take a walk with you  but i charge you  nan  never stir with her  nor obey her  without letting me know it  in the smallest trifles i say  walk with you  and where would you go  i tro  why  barbarous mrs  jewkes  said i  only to look a little up the elm walk  since you would not let me go to church nan  said she  to shew me how much they were all in her power  pull off madam s shoes  and bring them to me  i have taken care of her others indeed she shan t  said i nay  said nan  but i must if my mistress bids me  so pray  madam  don t hinder me  and so indeed would you believe it  she took my shoes off  and left me barefoot  and  for my share  i have been so frighted at this  that i have not power even to relieve my mind by my tears  i am quite stupefied to be sure here i was forced to leave off now i will give you a picture of this wretch  she is a broad  squat pursy  fat thing  quite ugly  if any thing human can be so called  about forty years old  she has a huge hand  and an arm as thick as my waist  i believe  her nose is flat and crooked  and her brows grow down over her eyes  a dead spiteful  grey  goggling eye  to be sure she has  and her face is flat and broad  and as to colour  looks like as if it had been pickled a month in saltpetre  i dare say she drinks she has a hoarse man like voice  and is as thick as she is long  and yet looks so deadly strong  that i am afraid she would dash me at her foot in an instant if i was to vex her so that with a heart more ugly than her face  she frightens me sadly  and i am undone to be sure  if god does not protect me  for she is very  very wicked indeed she is this is poor helpless spite in me but the picture is too near the truth notwithstanding  she sends me a message just now  that i shall have my shoes again  if i will accept of her company to walk with me in the garden to waddle with me  rather  thought i well  tis not my business to quarrel with her downright  i shall be watched the narrower  if i do  and so i will go with the hated wretch o for my dear mrs  jervis  or  rather  to be safe with my dear father and mother oh  i am out of my wits for joy  just as i have got my shoes on  i am told john  honest john  is come on horseback a blessing on his faithful heart  what joy is this  but i ll tell you more by and by  i must not let her know i am so glad to see this dear blessed john  to be sure alas  but he looks sad  as i see him out of the window  what can be the matter i hope my dear parents are well  and mrs  jervis  and mr  longman  and every body  my naughty master not excepted for i wish him to live and repent of all his wickedness to poor me o dear heart  what a world do we live in i am now come to take up my pen again  but i am in a sad taking truly  another puzzling trial  to be sure here was john  as i said  and the poor man came to me  with mrs  jewkes who whispered  that i would say nothing about the shoes  for my own sake  as she said  the poor man saw my distress  by my red eyes  and my hagged looks  i suppose  for i have had a sad time of it  you must needs think  and though he would have hid it  if he could  yet his own eyes ran over  oh  mrs  pamela  said he  oh  mrs  pamela  well  honest fellow servant  said i  i cannot help it at present  i am obliged to your honesty and kindness  to be sure  and then he wept more  said i for my heart was ready to break to see his grief  for it is a touching thing to see a man cry  tell me the worst  is my master coming  no  no said he  and sobbed well  said i  is there any news of my poor father and mother  how do they do i hope well  said he  i know nothing to the contrary  there is no mishap  i hope  to mrs  jervis or to mr  longman or my fellow servants no said he  poor man  with a long n o  as if his heart would burst  well  thank god then  said i the man s a fool  said mrs  jewkes  i think  what ado is here  why  sure thou rt in love  john  dost thou not see young madam is well  what ails thee  man  nothing at all  said he  but i am such a fool as to cry for joy to see good mrs  pamela  but i have a letter for you i took it  and saw it was from my master  so i put it in my pocket  mrs jewkes  said i  you need not  i hope  see this  no  no  said she  i see whose it is  well enough  or else  may be  i must have insisted on reading it and here is one for you  mrs  jewkes  said he  but yours  said he to me  requires an answer  which i must carry back early in the morning  or to night  if i can you have no more  john  said mrs  jewkes  for mrs  pamela  have you  no said he  i have not  but every body s kind love and service  ay  to us both  to be sure  said she  john  said i  i will read the letter  and pray take care of yourself  for you are a good man  god bless you  and i rejoice to see you  and hear from you all  but i longed to say more only that nasty mrs  jewkes so i went up  and locked myself in my closet  and opened the letter  and this is a copy of it my dearest pamela i send purposely to you on an affair that concerns you very much and me somewhat  but chiefly for your sake  i am conscious that i have proceeded by you in such a manner as may justly alarm your fears  and give concern to your honest friends  and all my pleasure is  that i can and will make you amends for the disturbance i have given you  as i promised  i sent to your father the day after your departure  that he might not be too much concerned for you  and assured him of my honour to you  and made an excuse  such an one as ought to have satisfied him  for your not coming to him  but this was not sufficient  it seems  for he poor man  came to me next morning  and set my family almost in an uproar about you o my dear girl  what trouble has not your obstinacy given me  and yourself too  i had no way to pacify him  but to promise that he should see a letter written from you to mrs  jervis  to satisfy him you are well now all my care in this case is for your aged parents  lest they should be touched with too fatal a grief  and for you  whose duty and affection for them i know to be so strong and laudable  for this reason i beg you will write a few lines to them  and let me prescribe the form  which i have done  putting myself as near as i can in your place  and expressing your sense  with a warmth that i doubt will have too much possessed you after what is done  and which cannot now be helped  but which  i assure you  shall turn out honourably for you  i expect not to be refused because i cannot possibly have any view in it  but to satisfy your parents  which is more your concern than mine  and so i must beg you will not alter one tittle of the underneath  if you do  it will be impossible for me to send it  or that it should answer the good end i propose by it i have promised  that i will not approach you without your leave  if i find you easy  and not attempting to dispute or avoid your present lot i will keep to my word  although it is a difficulty upon me  nor shall your restraint last long  for i will assure you  that i am resolved very soon to convince you of my good intentions  and with what ardour i am                                                      yours  etc the letter he prescribed for me was as this dear mrs  jervis i have  instead of being driven by robin to my dear father s  been carried off  where i have no liberty to tell  however  at present  i am not used hardly  and i write to beg you to let my dear father and mother  whose hearts must be well nigh broken  know that i am well  and that i am  and  by the grace of god  ever will be  their honest  as well as dutiful daughter  and your obliged friend i must neither send date nor place  but have most solemn assurances of honourable usage i knew not what to do on this most strange request and occasion  but my heart bled so much for you  my dear father  who had taken the pains to go yourself  and inquire after your poor daughter  as well as for my dear mother  that i resolved to write  and pretty much in the above form  that it might be sent to pacify you  till i could let you  somehow or other  know the true state of the matter  and i wrote thus to my strange wicked master himself sir if you knew but the anguish of my mind  and how much i suffer by your dreadful usage of me  you would surely pity me  and consent to my deliverance  what have i done  that i should be the only mark of your cruelty  i can have no hope  no desire of living left me  because i cannot have the least dependence  after what has passed  upon your solemn assurances it is impossible they should be consistent with the dishonourable methods you take nothing but your promise of not seeing me here in my deplorable bondage  can give me the least ray of hope don t  i beseech you  drive the poor distressed pamela upon a rock that may be the destruction both of her soul and body  you don t know sir  how dreadfully i dare  weak as i am of mind and intellect  when my virtue is in danger  and  o  hasten my deliverance  that a poor unworthy creature  below the notice of such a gentleman as you  may not be made the sport of a high condition  for no reason in the world  but because she is not able to defend herself  nor has a friend that can right her i have  sir  in part to shew my obedience to you  but indeed  i own more to give ease to the minds of my poor distressed parents  whose poverty  one would think  should screen them from violences of this sort  as well as their poor daughter  followed pretty much the form you have prescribed for me  in the letter to mrs  jervis  and the alterations i have made for i could not help a few  are of such a nature  as  though they shew my concern a little  yet must answer the end you are pleased to say you propose by this letter for god s sake  good sir  pity my lowly condition  and my present great misery  and let me join with all the rest of your servants to bless that goodness  which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted heart broken pamela i thought  when i had written this letter  and that which he had prescribed  it would look like placing a confidence in mrs  jewkes  to shew them to her  and i shewed her  at the same time  my master s letter to me  for i believed the value he expressed for me  would give me credit with one who professed in every thing to serve him  right or wrong  though i had so little reason  i fear  to pride myself in it  and i was not mistaken  for it has seemed to influence her not a little  and she is at present mighty obliging  and runs over in my praises  but is the less to be minded  because she praises as much the author of my miseries  and his honourable intentions  as she calls them  for i see that she is capable of thinking  as i fear he does  that every thing that makes for his wicked will is honourable  though to the ruin of the innocent  pray god i may find it otherwise  though  i hope  whatever the wicked gentleman may intend  that i shall be at last rid of her impertinent bold way of talk  when she seems to think  from his letter that he means honourably i am now come to monday  the th day of my bondage and misery i was in hope to have an opportunity to see john  and have a little private talk with him  before he went away  but it could not be  the poor man s excessive sorrow made mrs  jewkes take it into her head  to think he loved me  and so she brought up a message to me from him this morning that he was going  i desired he might come up to my closet  as i called it  and she came with him  the honest man  as i thought him was as full of concern as before  at taking leave and i gave him two letters  the one for mrs  jervis  enclosed in another for my master  but mrs  jewkes would see me seal them up  lest i should enclose any thing else i was surprised  at the man s going away  to see him drop a bit of paper  just at the head of the stairs  which i took up without being observed by mrs  jewkes  but i was a thousand times more surprised  when i returned to my closet  and opening it read as follows good mrs  pamela i am grieved to tell you how much you have been deceived and betrayed and that by such a vile dog as i  little did i think it would come to this  but i must say  if ever there was a rogue in the world  it is me i have all along shewed your letters to my master  he employed me for that purpose  and he saw every one  before i carried them to your father and mother  and then scaled them up  and sent me with them  i had some business that way  but not half so often as i pretended  and as soon as i heard how it was  i was ready to hang myself  you may well think i could not stand in your presence  o vile  vile wretch  to bring you to this  if you are ruined  i am the rogue that caused it  all the justice i can do you  is to tell you  you are in vile hands  and i am afraid will be undone in spite of all your sweet innocence  and i believe i shall never live  after i know it  if you can forgive me  you are exceeding good  but i shall never forgive myself  that s certain howsomever  it will do you no good to make this known  and may hap i may live to do you service  if i can  i will  i am sure i ought master kept your last two or three letters  and did not send them at all  i am the most abandoned wretch of wretches  j  arnold you see your undoing has been long hatching  pray take care of your sweet self  mrs  jewkes is a devil  but in my master s t other house you have not one false heart  but myself  out upon me for a villain my dear father and mother  when you come to this place  i make no doubt your hair will stand on end as mine does o the deceitfulness of the heart of man this john  that i took to be the honestest of men  that you took for the same  that was always praising you to me  and me to you  and for nothing so much as for our honest hearts  this very fellow was all the while a vile hypocrite  and a perfidious wretch  and helping to carry on my ruin but he says so much of himself  that i will only sit down with this sad reflection  that power and riches never want tools to promote their vilest ends  and there is nothing so hard to be known as the heart of man i can but pity the poor wretch  since he seems to have great remorse  and i believe it best to keep his wickedness secret  if it lies in my way  i will encourage his penitence  for i may possibly make some discoveries by it one thing i should mention in this place  he brought down  in a portmanteau  all the clothes and things my lady and master had given me and moreover two velvet hoods  and a velvet scarf  that used to be worn by my lady  but i have no comfort in them  or any thing else mrs  jewkes had the portmanteau brought into my closet  and she shewed me what was in it  but then locked it up  and said  she would let me have what i would out of it  when i asked  but if i had the key  it might make me want to go abroad  may be  and so the confident woman put it in her pocket i gave myself over to sad reflections upon this strange and surprising discovery of john s  and wept much for him  and for myself too  for now i see  as he says  my ruin has been long hatching  that i can make no doubt what my master s honourable professions will end in  what a heap of hard names does the poor fellow call himself  but what must they deserve  then  who set him to work  o what has this wicked master to answer for  to be so corrupt himself  and to corrupt others  who would have been all innocent  and to carry on a poor plot  i am sure for a gentleman  to ruin a poor creature  who never did him harm  nor wished him any  and who can still pray for his happiness  and his repentance i can t but wonder what these gentlemen  as they are called  can think of themselves for these vile doings  john had some inducement  for he hoped to please his master  who rewarded him and was bountiful to him and the same may be said  bad as she is  for this same odious mrs jewkes  but what inducement has my master for taking so much pains to do the devil s work for him if he loves me  as tis falsely called  must he therefore lay traps for me  to ruin me and make me as bad as himself i cannot imagine what good the undoing of such a poor creature as i can procure him to be sure  i am a very worthless body  people  indeed say i am handsome  but if i was so  should not a gentleman prefer an honest servant to a guilty harlot  and must he be more earnest to seduce me  because i dread of all things to be seduced  and would rather lose my life than my honesty well  these are strange things to me  i cannot account for them  for my share  but sure nobody will say  that these fine gentlemen have any tempter but their own wicked wills his naughty master could run away from me  when he apprehended his servants might discover his vile attempts upon me in that sad closet affair  but is it not strange that he should not be afraid of the all seeing eye  from which even that base plotting heart of his  in its most secret motions  could not be hid but what avail me these sorrowful reflections  he is and will be wicked  and designs me a victim to his lawless attempts  if the god in whom i trust  and to whom i hourly pray  prevent it not tuesday and wednesday i have been hindered by this wicked woman s watching me so close  from writing on tuesday  and so i will put both these days together  i have been a little turn with her for an airing  in the chariot  and walked several times in the garden  but have always her at my heels mr  williams came to see us  and took a walk with us once  and while her back was just turned  encouraged by the hint he had before given me i said  sir  i see two tiles upon that parsley bed  might not one cover them with mould  with a note between them  on occasion a good hint said he  let that sunflower by the back door of the garden be the place i have a key to the door  for it is my nearest way to the town so i was forced to begin  o what inventions will necessity push us upon i hugged myself at the thought  and she coming to us  he said  as if he was continuing a discourse we were in  no  not extraordinary pleasant what s that  what s that  said mrs  jewkes only  said he  the town i m saying  is not very pleasant  no  indeed  said she  it is not  it is a poor town  to my thinking  are there any gentry in it  said i  and so we chatted on about the town  to deceive her  but my deceit intended no hurt to any body we then talked of the garden  how large and pleasant  and the like  and sat down on the tufted slope of the fine fish pond  to see the fishes play upon the surface of the water  and she said  i should angle if i would i wish  said i  you d be so kind to fetch me a rod and baits  pretty mistress  said she i know better than that  i ll assure you  at this time i mean no harm  said i  indeed  let me tell you  said she  i know none who have their thoughts more about them than you  a body ought to look to it where you are  but we ll angle a little to morrow  mr williams  who is much afraid of her  turned the discourse to a general subject  i sauntered in  and left them to talk by themselves  but he went away to town  and she was soon after me i had got to my pen and ink  and i said  i want some paper  mrs  jewkes putting what i was about in my bosom  you know i have written two letters  and sent them by john  o how his name  poor guilty fellow grieves me  well  said she  you have some left  one sheet did for those two letters  yes  said i  but i used half another for a cover  you know  and see how i have scribbled the other half  and so i shewed her a parcel of broken scraps of verses  which i had tried to recollect  and had written purposely that she might see  and think me usually employed to such idle purposes  ay  said she  so you have  well  i ll give you two sheets more  but let me see how you dispose of them  either written or blank  well  thought i  i hope still  argus  to be too hard for thee now argus  the poets say  had a hundred eyes  and was set to watch with them all  as she does she brought me the paper  and said  now  madam  let me see you write something  i will  said i  and took the pen and wrote  i wish mrs jewkes would be so good to me  as i would be to her  if i had it in my power that s pretty now  said she  well  i hope i am  but what then why then wrote i  she would do me the favour to let me know  what i have done to be made her prisoner  and what she thinks is to become of me  well  and what then  said she  why then  of consequence scribbled i  she would let me see her instructions  that i may know how far to blame  or to acquit her thus i fooled on  to shew her my fondness for scribbling  for i had no expectation of any good from her  that so she might suppose i employed myself  as i said  to no better purpose at other times  for she will have it  that i am upon some plot  i am so silent  and love so much to be by myself she would have made me write on a little further  no said i  you have not answered me  why  said she  what can you doubt when my master himself assures you of his honour  ay  said i  but lay your hand to your heart  mrs  jewkes  and tell me  if you yourself believe him  yes  said she  to be sure i do  but  said i  what do you call honour  why  said she  what does he call honour  think you ruin shame  disgrace  said i  i fear pho  pho  said she  if you have any doubt about it  he can best explain his own meaning i ll send him word to come and satisfy you  if you will horrid creature  said i  all in a fright can st thou not stab me to the heart  i d rather thou would st than say such another word but i hope there is no such thought of his coming she had the wickedness to say  no  no  he don t intend to come  as i know of but if i was he  i would not be long away  what means the woman  said i mean  said she  turning it off  why i mean  i would come  if i was he  and put an end to all your fears by making you as happy as you wish  it is out of his power  said i  to make me happy great and rich as he is  but by leaving me innocent  and giving me liberty to go to my dear father and mother she went away soon after  and i ended my letter  in hopes to have an opportunity to lay it in the appointed place  so i went to her  and said  i suppose  as it is not dark  i may take another turn in the garden  it is too late  said she  but if you will go  don t stay  and nan  see and attend madam  as she called me so i went towards the pond  the maid following me  and dropt purposely my hussy  and when i came near the tiles  i said  mrs  anne  i have dropt my hussy  be so kind as to look for it  i had it by the pond side  she went back to look  and i slipt the note between the tiles and covered them as quick as i could with the light mould  quite unperceived  and the maid finding the hussy  i took it  and sauntered in again  and met mrs  jewkes coming to see after me  what i wrote was this reverend sir the want of an opportunity to speak my mind to you  i am sure will excuse this boldness in a poor creature that is betrayed hither  i have reason to think  for the worst of purposes  you know something  to be sure  of my story  my native poverty  which i am not ashamed of  my late lady s goodness  and my master s designs upon me  it is true he promises honour  and all that  but the honour of the wicked is disgrace and shame to the virtuous  and he may think he keeps his promises  according to the notions he may allow himself to hold  and yet  according to mine and every good body s  basely ruin me i am so wretched  and ill treated by this mrs  jewkes  and she is so ill principled a woman  that  as i may soon want the opportunity which the happy hint of this day affords to my hopes  i throw myself at once upon your goodness  without the least reserve  for i cannot be worse than i am  should that fail me  which  i dare say  to your power  it will not  for i see it  sir  in your looks  i hope it from your cloth and i doubt it not from your inclination  in a case circumstanced as my unhappy one is  for  sir  in helping me out of my present distress you perform all the acts of religion in one  and the highest mercy and charity  both to the body and soul of a poor wretch  that  believe me  sir  has  at present  not so much as in thought swerved from her innocence is there not some way to be found out for my escape  without danger to yourself  is there no gentleman or lady of virtue in this neighbourhood to whom i may fly  only till l can find a way to get to my poor father and mother  cannot lady davers be made acquainted with my sad story  by your conveying a letter to her  my poor parents are so low in the world they can do nothing but break their hearts for me  and that  i fear will be the end of it my master promises  if i will be easy  as he calls it  in my present lot  he will not come down without my consent  alas  sir  this is nothing  for what s the promise of a person who thinks himself at liberty to act as he has done by me  if he comes  it must be to ruin me and come to be sure he will  when he thinks he has silenced the clamours of my friends  and lulled me  as no doubt he hopes  into a fatal security now  therefore  sir  is all the time i have to work and struggle for the preservation of my honesty  if i stay till he comes  i am undone you have a key to the back garden door  i have great hopes from that study  good sir  and contrive for me  i will faithfully keep your secret yet i should be loath to have you suffer for me  i say no more but commit this to the happy tiles  in the bosom of that earth  where  i hope  my deliverance will take root  and bring forth such fruit  as may turn to my inexpressible joy  and your eternal reward  both here and hereafter  as shall ever pray  your oppressed humble servant thursday this completes a terrible week since my setting out  as i hoped to see you  my dear father and mother  o how different were my hopes then  from what they are now  yet who knows what these happy tiles may produce but i must tell you  first  how i have been beaten by mrs  jewkes  it is very true and thus it came about my impatience was great to walk in the garden  to see if any thing had offered  answerable to my hopes  but this wicked mrs  jewkes would not let me go without her  and said  she was not at leisure  we had a great many words about it  for i told her  it was very hard i could not be trusted to walk by myself in the garden for a little air  but must be dogged and watched worse than a thief she still pleaded her instructions  and said she was not to trust me out of her sight  and you had better  said she  be easy and contented  i assure you  for i have worse orders than you have yet found  i remember added she  your asking mr  williams  if there were any gentry in the neighbourhood  this makes me suspect you want to get away to them  to tell your sad dismal story  as you call it my heart was at my mouth  for i feared  by that hint  she had seen my letter under the tiles  o how uneasy i was  at last she said  well since you take on so  you may take a turn  and i will be with you in a minute when i was out of sight of her window  i speeded towards the hopeful place  but was soon forced to slacken my pace  by her odious voice hey day  why so nimble  and whither so fast  said she  what  are you upon a wager  i stopt for her  till her pursy sides were waddled up to me  and she held by my arm  half out of breath  so i was forced to pass by the dear place  without daring to look at it the gardener was at work a little farther  and so we looked upon him and i began to talk about his art  but she said  softly  my instructions are  not to let you be so familiar with the servants  why  said i  are you afraid i should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my master  may be i am  said the odious wretch  for to rob him of yourself would be the worst that could happen to him  in his opinion and pray  said i  walking on  how came i to be his property  what right has he in me  but such as a thief may plead to stolen goods why was ever the like heard  says she this is downright rebellion  i protest well  well  lambkin  which the foolish often calls me  if i was in his place  he should not have his property in you long questionable  why  what would you do  said i  if you were he not stand shill i shall i  as he does  but put you and himself both out of your pain why  jezebel  said i  i could not help it  would you ruin me by force upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder  take that said she  whom do you call jezebel i was so surprised  for you never beat me  my dear father and mother in your lives  that i was like one thunder struck  and looked round  as if i wanted somebody to help me  but  alas  i had nobody  and said  at last  rubbing my shoulder  is this also in your instructions alas  for me  am i to be beaten too  and so fell a crying  and threw myself upon the grass walk we were upon said she  in a great pet  i won t be called such names  i ll assure you  marry come up  i see you have a spirit  you must and shall be kept under  i ll manage such little provoking things as you  i warrant ye  come  come  we ll go in a doors and i ll lock you up  and you shall have no shoes  nor any thing else if this be the case i did not know what to do  this was a cruel thing to me  and i blamed myself for my free speech  for now i have given her some pretence  and o  thought i  here i have  by my malapertness  ruined the only project i had left the gardener saw this scene  but she called to him  well  jacob  what do you stare at  pray mind what you re upon  and away he walked  to another quarter  out of sight well  thought i  i must put on the dissembler a little  i see  she took my hand roughly  come  get up  said she  and come in a doors i ll jezebel you  i will so why  dear mrs  jewkes  said i none of your dears  and your coaxing  said she  why not jezebel again she was in a fearful passion  i saw  and i was out of my wits  thought i  i have often heard women blamed for their tongues  i wish mine had been shorter  but i can t go in  said i  indeed i can t why  said she can t you  i ll warrant i can take such a thin body as you under my arm and carry you in  if you won t walk  you don t know my strength yes but i do  said i  too well  and will you not use me worse when i come in so i arose  and she muttered to herself all the way  she to be a jezebel with me  that had used me so well  and such like when i came near the house  i said  sitting down upon a settle bench well  i will not go in  till you say you forgive me  mrs  jewkes if you will forgive my calling you that name  i will forgive your beating me she sat down by me  and seemed in a great pucker  and said  well come  i will forgive you for this time  and so kissed me  as a mark of reconciliation but pray  said i  tell me where i am to walk and go and give me what liberty you can  and when i know the most you can favour me with  you shall see i will be as content as i can  and not ask you for more ay  said she  this is something like  i wish i could give you all the liberty you desire  for you must think it is no pleasure to me to tie you to my petticoat  as it were  and not let you stir without me but people that will do their duties  must have some trouble  and what i do  is to serve as good a master  to be sure  as lives yes  said i  to every body but me  he loves you too well  to be sure  returned she and that s the reason  so you ought to bear it  i say  love  replied i come  said she  don t let the wench see you have been crying  nor tell her any tales  for you won t tell them fairly  i am sure  and i ll send her  and you shall take another walk in the garden  if you will  may be it will get you a stomach to your dinner  for you don t eat enough to keep life and soul together  you are beauty to the bone  added the strange wretch  or you could not look so well as you do  with so little stomach  so little rest  and so much pining and whining for nothing at all  well  thought i  say what thou wilt  so i can be rid of thy bad tongue and company  and i hope to find some opportunity now to come at my sunflower  but i walked the other way  to take that in my return  to avoid suspicion i forced my discourse to the maid  but it was all upon general things for i find she is asked after every thing i say and do  when i came near the place  as i had been devising  i said  pray step to the gardener and ask him to gather a sallad for me to dinner  she called out  jacob said i  he can t hear you so far off  and pray tell him  i should like a cucumber too  if he has one  when she had stept about a bow shot from me  i popt down  and whipt my fingers under the upper tile  and pulled out a letter without direction  and thrust it in my bosom  trembling for joy  she was with me  before i could well secure it  and i was in such a taking that i feared i should discover myself  you seem frightened madam  said she  why  said i  with a lucky thought  alas  your poor daughter will make an intriguer by and by  but i hope an innocent one i stooped to smell at the sunflower  and a great nasty worm ran into the ground  that startled me  for i can t abide worms  said she  sunflowers don t smell  so i find  replied i  and then we walked in  and mrs jewkes said  well  you have made haste now you shall go another time i went up to my closet  locked myself in  and opening my letter  found in it these words i am infinitely concerned for your distress  i most heartily wish it may be in my power to serve and save so much innocence  beauty  and merit  my whole dependance is upon mr  b  and i have a near view of being provided for by his favour to me  but yet i would sooner forfeit all my hopes in him  trusting in god for the rest  than not assist you  if possible  i never looked upon mr  b  in the light he now appears in to me  in your case  to be sure  he is no professed debauchee  but i am entirely of opinion  you should  if possible  get out of his hands  and especially as you are in very bad ones in mrs jewkes s we have here the widow lady jones  mistress of a good fortune  and a woman of virtue  i believe  we have also old sir simon darnford  and his lady  who is a good woman  and they have two daughters  virtuous young ladies  all the rest are but middling people  and traders  at best  i will try  if you please  either lady jones  or lady darnford  if they ll permit you to take refuge with them  i see no probability of keeping myself concealed in this matter  but will  as i said  risk all things to serve you  for i never saw a sweetness and innocence like yours  and your hard case has attached me entirely to you  for i know  as you so happily express  if i can serve you in this case  i shall thereby perform all the acts of religion in one as to lady davers  i will convey a letter  if you please  to her  but it must not be from our post house  i give you caution  for the man owes all his bread to mr  b  and his place too  and i believe  by something that dropt from him  over a can of ale  has his instructions you don t know how you are surrounded  all which confirms me in your opinion  that no honour is meant you  let what will be professed  and i am glad you want no caution on that head give me leave to say  that i had heard much in your praise  but  i think  greatly short of what you deserve  both as to person and mind my eyes convince me of the one  your letter of the other  for fear of losing the present lucky opportunity  i am longer than otherwise i should be  but i will not enlarge  any further than to assure you that i am  to the best of my power                       your faithful friend and servant                                                   arthur williams i will come once every morning  and once every evening  after school time  to look for your letters  i ll come in  and return without going into the house  if i see the coast clear  otherwise  to avoid suspicion  i ll come in i instantly  in answer to this pleasing letter  wrote as follows reverend sir o how suited to your function  and your character  is your kind letter god bless you for it  i now think i am beginning to be happy  i should be sorry to have you suffer on my account  but i hope it will be made up to you an hundred fold  by that god whom you so faithfully serve  i should be too happy  could i ever have it in my power to contribute in the least to it  but  alas  to serve me  must be for god s sake only for i am poor and lowly in fortune  though in mind  i hope  too high to do a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom  but i lose time any way you think best  i should be pleased with  for i know not the persons  nor in what manner it is best to apply to them  i am glad of the hint you so kindly give me of the man at the post house  i was thinking of opening a way for myself by letter  when i could have opportunity  but i see more and more that i am  indeed  strangely surrounded with dangers  and that there is no dependance to be made on my master s honour i should think  sir  if either of those ladies would give leave  i might some way get out by favour of your key  and as it is impossible watched as i am  to know when it can be  suppose  sir  you get one made by it  and put it  the next opportunity  under the sunflower i am sure no time is to be lost  because it is rather my wonder  that she is not thoughtful about this key  than otherwise  for she forgets not the minutest thing  but  sir  if i had this key  i could  if these ladies would not shelter me  run away any where  and if i was once out of the house  they could have no pretence to force me again  for i have done no harm  and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body  and by this way you need not to be known  torture should not wring it from me i assure you one thing more  good sir  have you no correspondence with my master s bedfordshire family  by that means  may be  i could be informed of his intention of coming hither  and when i enclose you a letter of a deceitful wretch  for i can trust you with any thing  poor john arnold its contents will tell why i enclose it  perhaps by his means  something may be discovered  for he seems willing to atone for his treachery to me  by the intimation of future service  i leave the hint to you to improve upon  and am               reverend sir                   your for ever obliged  and thankful servant i hope  sir  by your favour  i could send a little packet  now and then  some how  to my poor father and mother  i have a little stock of money  about five or six guineas  shall i put half in your hands  to defray the charge of a man and horse  or any other incidents i had but just time to transcribe this  before i was called to dinner and i put that for mr  williams  with a wafer in it  in my bosom  to get an opportunity to lay it in the dear place o good sirs  of all the flowers in the garden  the sunflower  sure is the loveliest it is a propitious one to me  how nobly my plot succeeds  but i begin to be afraid my writings may be discovered  for they grow large  i stitch them hitherto in my under coat  next my linen but if this brute should search me i must try to please her  and then she won t well  i am but just come off from a walk in the garden  and have deposited my letter by a simple wile  i got some horse beans  and we took a turn in the garden  to angle  as mrs  jewkes had promised me  she baited the hook  and i held it  and soon hooked a lovely carp  play it play it  said she  i did  and brought it to the bank  a sad thought just then came into my head  and i took it  and threw it in again  and o the pleasure it seemed to have  to flounce in  when at liberty why this says she  o mrs  jewkes  said i  i was thinking this poor carp was the unhappy pamela  i was likening you and myself to my naughty master  as we hooked and deceived the poor carp  so was i betrayed by false baits and when you said  play it  play it  it went to my heart  to think i should sport with the destruction of the poor fish i had betrayed  and i could not but fling it in again  and did you not see the joy with which the happy carp flounced from us  o  said i  may some good merciful body procure me my liberty in the same manner  for to be sure  i think my danger equal lord bless thee  said she  what a thought is there well  i can angle no more  added i  i ll try my fortune  said she  and took the rod  do answered i  and i will plant life  if i can  while you are destroying it  i have some horse beans here  and will go and stick them in one of the borders  to see how long they will be coming up  and i will call them my garden so you see  dear father and mother  i hope now you will soon see  for may be  if i can t get away so soon myself  i may send my papers some how  i say you will see  that this furnishes me with a good excuse to look after my garden another time  and if the mould should look a little freshish  it won t be so much suspected  she mistrusted nothing of this and i went and stuck in here and there my beans  for about the length of five ells  of each side of the sunflower  and easily deposited my letter  and not a little proud am i of this contrivance  sure something will do at last friday  saturday i have just now told you a trick of mine  now i ll tell you a trick of this wicked woman s  she comes up to me  says she  i have a bill i cannot change till to morrow  and a tradesman wants his money most sadly  and i don t love to turn poor trades folks away without their money  have you any about you  i have a little  replied i  how much will do  oh  said she  i want eight pounds  alack  said i  i have but between five and six  lend me that  said she  till to morrow  i did so  and she went down stairs  and when she came up  she laughed  and said  well i have paid the tradesman  said i  i hope you ll give it me again to morrow  at that  the assurance  laughing loud  said  why  what occasion have you for money  to tell you the truth  lambkin  i didn t want it  i only feared you might make a bad use of it  and now i can trust nan with you a little oftener  especially as i have got the key of your portmanteau  so that you can neither corrupt her with money nor fine things  never did any body look more silly than i o how i fretted  to be so foolishly outwitted and the more  as i had hinted to mr  williams  that i would put some in his hands to defray the charges of my sending to you  i cried for vexation and now i have not five shillings left to support me  if i can get away was ever such a fool as i  i must be priding myself in my contrivances  indeed  said i  was this your instructions  wolfkin  for she called me lambkin  jezebel you mean  child  said she well  i now forgive you heartily  let s buss and be friends out upon you said i  i cannot bear you but i durst not call her names again  for i dread her huge paw most sadly  the more i think of this thing  the more do i regret it  and blame myself this night the man from the post house brought a letter for mrs  jewkes in which was one enclosed for me  she brought it me up  said she  well my good master don t forget us  he has sent you a letter  and see what he writes to me  so she read  that he hoped her fair charge was well happy  and contented  ay  to be sure  said i  i can t choose that he did not doubt her care and kindness to me  that i was very dear to him and she could not use me too well  and the like  there s a master for you  said she  sure you will love and pray for him  i desired her to read the rest  no  no  said she  but i won t  said i  are there any orders for taking my shoes away  and for beating me  no  said she  nor about jezebel neither  well  returned i  i cry truce  for i have no mind to be beat again  i thought  said she  we had forgiven one another my letter is as follows my dear pamela i begin to repent already  that i have bound myself  by promise  not to see you till you give me leave  for i think the time very tedious can you place so much confidence in me  as to invite me down  assure yourself  that your generosity shall not be thrown away upon me  i the rather would press this  as i am uneasy for your uneasiness  for mrs jewkes acquaints me  that you take your restraint very heavily  and neither eat  drink  nor rest well  and i have too great interest in your health  not to wish to shorten the time of this trial  which will be the consequence of my coming down to you  john  too  has intimated to me your concern  with a grief that hardly gave him leave for utterance  a grief that a little alarmed my tenderness for you  not that i fear any thing  but that your disregard to me  which yet my proud heart will hardly permit me to own  may throw you upon some rashness  that might encourage a daring hope  but how poorly do i descend  to be anxious about such a menial as he i will only say one thing  that if you will give me leave to attend you at the hall  consider who it is that requests this from you as a favour  i solemnly declare  that you shall have cause to be pleased with this obliging mark of your confidence in me  and consideration for me  and if i find mrs  jewkes has not behaved to you with the respect due to one i so dearly love  i will put it entirely into your power to discharge her the house  if you think proper  and mrs  jervis  or who else you please  shall attend you in her place  this i say on a hint john gave me  as if you resented something from that quarter  dearest pamela  answer favourably this earnest request of one that cannot live without you  and on whose honour to you  you may absolutely depend  and so much the more  as you place a confidence in it  i am  and assuredly ever will be                        your faithful and affectionate  etc you will be glad  i know  to hear your father and mother are well  and easy upon your last letter  that gave me a pleasure that i am resolved you shall not repent  mrs  jewkes will convey to me your answer i but slightly read this letter for the present  to give way to one i had hopes of finding by this time from mr  williams  i took an evening turn  as i called it  in mrs  jewkes s company  and walking by the place  i said  do you think  mrs  jewkes  any of my beans can have struck since yesterday  she laughed  and said  you are a poor gardener but i love to see you divert yourself  she passing on  i found my good friend had provided for me  and  slipping it in my bosom  for her back was towards me  here  said i  having a bean in my hand  is one of them  but it has not stirred  no  to be sure  said she  and turned upon me a most wicked jest  unbecoming the mouth of a woman  about planting etc  when i came in  i hied to my closet  and read as follows i am sorry to tell you that i have had a repulse from lady jones  she is concerned at your case  she says  but don t care to make herself enemies  i applied to lady darnford  and told her in the most pathetic manner i could  your sad story  and shewed her your more pathetic letter  i found her well disposed  but she would advise with sir simon who by the by is not a man of an extraordinary character for virtue  but he said to his lady in my presence  why  what is all this  my dear  but that our neighbour has a mind to his mother s waiting maid  and if he takes care she wants for nothing  i don t see any great injury will be done her  he hurts no family by this  so  my dear father and mother it seems that poor people s honesty is to go for nothing  and i think mr  williams  you  of all men  should not engage in this affair  against your friend and patron  he spoke this in so determined a manner  that the lady had done  and i had only to beg no notice should be taken of the matter as from me i have hinted your case to mr  peters  the minister of this parish but i am concerned to say  that he imputed selfish views to me  as if i would make an interest in your affections by my zeal  and when i represented the duties of our function  and the like  and protested my disinterestedness  he coldly said  i was very good  but was a young man and knew little of the world  and though it was a thing to be lamented yet when he and i should set about to reform mankind in this respect  we should have enough upon our hands  for  he said  it was too common and fashionable a case to be withstood by a private clergyman or two  and then he uttered some reflections upon the conduct of the present fathers of the church  in regard to the first personages of the realm  as a justification of his coldness on this score i represented the different circumstances of your affair  that other women lived evilly by their own consent  but to serve you  was to save an innocence that had but few examples  and then i shewed him your letter he said it was prettily written  and he was sorry for you  and that your good intentions ought to be encouraged  but what  said he  would you have me do  mr  williams  why suppose  sir  said i  you give her shelter in your house  with your spouse and niece  till she can get to her friends what  and embroil myself with a man of mr  b s power and fortune  no  not i  i ll assure you and i would have you consider what you are about  besides  she owns  continued he  that he promises to do honourably by her  and her shyness will procure her good terns enough  for he is no covetous nor wicked gentleman  except in this case and tis what all young gentlemen will do i am greatly concerned for him  i assure you  but i am not discouraged by this ill success  let what will come of it  if i can serve you i don t hear  as yet  that mr  b  is coming  i am glad of your hint as to that unhappy fellow john arnold  something  perhaps  will strike out from that  which may be useful  as to your packets  if you seal them up  and lay them in the usual place  if you find it not suspected  i will watch an opportunity to convey them  but if they are large  you had best be very cautious  this evil woman  i find  mistrusts me much i just hear  that the gentleman is dying  whose living mr  b  has promised me  i have almost a scruple to take it  as i am acting so contrary to his desires  but i hope he will one day thank me for it  as to money  don t think of it at present  be assured you may command all in my power to do for you without reserve i believe  when we hear he is coming  it will be best to make use of the key  which i shall soon procure you  and i can borrow a horse for you  i believe  to wait within half a mile of the back door  over the pasture  and will contrive  by myself  or somebody  to have you conducted some miles distant  to one of the villages thereabouts  so don t be discomforted  i beseech you  i am  excellent mrs  pamela                                            your faithful friend  etc i made a thousand sad reflections upon the former part of this honest gentleman s kind letter  and but for the hope he gave me at last  should have given up my case as quite desperate  i then wrote to thank him most gratefully for his kind endeavours  to lament the little concern the gentry had for my deplorable case  the wickedness of the world  first to give way to such iniquitous fashions  and then plead the frequency of them  against the attempt to amend them  and how unaffected people were with the distresses of others  i recalled my former hint as to writing to lady davers  which i feared  i said  would only serve to apprise her brother  that she knew his wicked scheme  and more harden him in it  and make him come down the sooner  and to be the more determined on my ruin  besides that it might make mr  williams guessed at  as a means of conveying my letter  and being very fearful  that if that good lady would interest herself in my behalf  which was a doubt  because she both loved and feared her brother  it would have no effect upon him and that therefore i would wait the happy event i might hope for from his kind assistance in the key  and the horse  i intimated my master s letter  begging to be permitted to come down  was fearful it might be sudden  and that i was of opinion no time was to be lost  for we might let slip all our opportunities  telling him the money trick of this vile woman  etc i had not time to take a copy of this letter  i was so watched  and when i had it ready in my bosom  i was easy  and so i went to seek out mrs jewkes  and told her  i would have her advice upon the letter i had received from my master  which point of confidence in her pleased her not a little  ay  said she  now this is something like  and we ll take a turn in the garden  or where you please  i pretended it was indifferent to me  and so we walked into the garden  i began to talk to her of the letter  but was far from acquainting her with all the contents  only that he wanted my consent to come down  and hoped she used me kindly and the like  and i said  now  mrs  jewkes  let me have your advice as to this  why then  said she  i will give it you freely  e en send to him to come down  it will highly oblige him  and i dare say you ll fare the better for it  how the better  said i i dare say  you think yourself that he intends my ruin  i hate  said she  that foolish word  your ruin why  ne er a lady in the land may live happier than you if you will  or be more honourably used well  mrs  jewkes  said i  i shall not  at this time  dispute with you about the words ruin and honourable  for i find we have quite different notions of both  but now i will speak plainer than ever i did  do you think he intends to make proposals to me as to a kept mistress  or kept slave rather  or do you not why  lambkin  said she  what dost thou think thyself i fear  said i  he does  well  said she  but if he does for i know nothing of the matter  i assure you  you may have your own terms i see that  for you may do any thing with him i could not bear this to be spoken  though it was all i feared of a long time  and began to exclaim most sadly  nay  said she  he may marry you as far as i know no  no  said i  that cannot be i neither desire nor expect it  his condition don t permit me to have such a thought  and that  and the whole series of his conduct  convinces me of the contrary and you would have me invite him to come down  would you  is not this to invite my ruin tis what i would do  said she  in your place  and if it was to be as you think  i should rather be out of my pain  than live in continual frights and apprehensions  as you do  no  replied i  an hour of innocence is worth an age of guilt  and were my life to be made ever so miserable by it  i should never forgive myself  if i were not to lengthen out to the longest minute my happy time of honesty  who knows what providence may do for me why  may be  said she  as he loves you so well  you may prevail upon him by your prayers and tears  and for that reason  i should think  you d better let him come down  well  said i  i will write him a letter because he expects an answer  or may be he will make a pretence to come down  how can it go i ll take care of that  said she  it is in my instructions ay  thought i  so i doubt  by the hint mr  williams gave me about the post house the gardener coming by  i said  mr  jacob  i have planted a few beans and i call the place my garden  it is just by the door out yonder  i ll shew it you  pray don t dig them up  so i went on with him  and when we had turned the alley  out of her sight and were near the place said i pray step to mrs  jewkes  and ask her if she has any more beans for me to plant  he smiled  i suppose at my foolishness  and i popped the letter under the mould  and stepped back  as if waiting for his return which  being near  was immediate  and she followed him  what should i do with beans  said she and sadly scared me  for she whispered me  i am afraid of some fetch  you don t use to send on such simple errands what fetch  said i  it is hard i can neither stir  nor speak but i must be suspected why  said she  my master writes  that i must have all my eyes about me  for though you are as innocent as a dove  yet you are as cunning as a serpent  but i ll forgive you  if you cheat me then i thought of my money  and could have called her names  had i dared  and i said  pray mrs  jewkes  now you talk of forgiving me  if i cheat you  be so kind as to pay me my money  for though i have no occasion for it  yet i know you was but in jest  and intended to give it me again  you shall have it in a proper time  said she  but  indeed  i was in earnest to get it out of your hands  for fear you should make an ill use of it  and so we cavilled upon this subject as we walked in  and i went up to write my letter to my master  and  as i intended to shew it her  i resolved to write accordingly as to her part of it  for i made little account of his offer of mrs  jervis to me  instead of this wicked woman  though the most agreeable thing that could have befallen me except my escape from hence  nor indeed any thing he said  for to be honourable  in the just sense of the word  he need not have caused me to be run away with  and confined as i am  i wrote as follows honoured sir when i consider how easily you might make me happy  since all i desire is to be permitted to go to my poor father and mother  when i reflect upon your former proposal to me in relation to a certain person  not one word of which is now mentioned  and upon my being in that strange manner run away with  and still kept here a miserable prisoner  do you think sir  pardon your poor servant s freedom  my fears make me bold  do you think  i say  that your general assurances of honour to me  can have the effect upon me  that  were it not for these things  all your words ought to have o  good sir  i too much apprehend that your notions of honour and mine are very different from one another  and i have no other hopes but in your continued absence  if you have any proposals to make me  that are consistent with your honourable professions  in my humble sense of the word  a few lines will communicate them to me  and i will return such an answer as befits me  but  oh  what proposals can one in your high station have to make to one in my low one  i know what belongs to your degree too well  to imagine  that any thing can be expected but sad temptations  and utter distress  if you come down  and you know not sir  when i am made desperate  what the wretched pamela dares to do whatever rashness you may impute to me  i cannot help it  but i wish i may not be forced upon any  that otherwise would never enter into my thoughts  forgive me  sir  my plainness  i should be loath to behave to my master unbecomingly  but i must needs say  sir  my innocence is so dear to me  that all other considerations are  and  i hope  shall ever be  treated by me as niceties  that ought  for that  to be dispensed with  if you mean honourably  why  sir  should you not let me know it plainly  why is it necessary to imprison me  to convince me of it  and why must i be close watched  and attended  hindered from stirring out from speaking to any body  from going so much as to church to pray for you  who have been  till of late  so generous a benefactor to me  why sir  i humbly ask  why all this  if you mean honourably it is not for me to expostulate so freely  but in a case so near to me  with you  sir so greatly my superior  pardon me  i hope you will  but as to seeing you  i cannot bear the dreadful apprehension  whatever you have to propose  whatever you intend by me  let my assent be that of a free person  mean as i am  and not of a sordid slave  who is to be threatened and frightened into a compliance with measures  which your conduct to her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorred by her my restraint is indeed hard upon me  i am very uneasy under it  shorten it  i beseech you  or but i will not dare to say more  than that i am                               your greatly oppressed unhappy servant after i had taken a copy of this  i folded it up  and mrs  jewkes coming just as i had done  sat down by me  and said  when she saw me direct it  i wish you would tell me if you have taken my advice  and consented to my master s coming down  if it will oblige you  said i i will read it to you  that s good  said she  then i ll love you dearly said i  then you must not offer to alter one word  i won t replied she  so i read it to her  and she praised me much for my wording it  but said she thought i pushed the matter very close  and it would better bear talking of  than writing about  she wanted an explanation or two  as about the proposal to a certain person  but i said  she must take it as she heard it  well  well  said she  i make no doubt you understand one another  and will do so more and more  i sealed up the letter  and she undertook to convey it sunday for my part  i knew it in vain to expect to have leave to go to church now  and so i did not ask  and i was the more indifferent  because  if i might have had permission  the sight of the neighbouring gentry  who had despised my sufferings  would have given me great regret and sorrow  and it was impossible i should have edified under any doctrine preached by mr  peters  so i applied myself to my private devotions mr  williams came yesterday  and this day  as usual  and took my letter but  having no good opportunity  we avoided one another s conversation and kept at a distance  but i was concerned i had not the key  for i would not have lost a moment in that case  had i been he  and he i  when i was at my devotion  mrs  jewkes came up  and wanted me sadly to sing her a psalm  as she had often on common days importuned me for a song upon the spinnet  but i declined it  because my spirits were so low i could hardly speak  nor cared to be spoken to  but when she was gone  i remembering the cxxxviith psalm to be a little touching  turned to it and took the liberty to alter it  somewhat nearer to my case  i hope i did not sin in it  but thus i turned it               i   when sad i sat in b n hall     all guarded round about   and thought of ev ry absent friend     the tears for grief burst out              ii   my joys and hopes all overthrown     my heart strings almost broke   unfit my mind for melody     much more to bear a joke             iii   then she to whom i pris ner was     said to me  tauntingly   now cheer your heart  and sing a song     and tune your mind to joy              iv   alas  said i  how can i frame     my heavy heart to sing   or tune my mind  while thus enthrall d     by such a wicked thing               v   but yet  if from my innocence     i  ev n in thought  should slide   then let my fingers quite forget     the sweet spinnet to guide              vi   and let my tongue within my mouth     be lock d for ever fast   if i rejoice  before i see     my full deliv rance past             vii   and thou  almighty  recompense     the evils i endure   from those who seek my sad disgrace     so causeless  to procure            viii   remember  lord  this mrs  jewkes     when  with a mighty sound   she cries  down with her chastity     down to the very ground              ix   ev n so shalt thou  o wicked one     at length to shame be brought   and happy shall all those be call d     that my deliv rance wrought               x   yea  blessed shall the man be called     that shames thee of thy evil   and saves me from thy vile attempts     and thee  too  from the d l monday  tuesday  wednesday i write now with a little more liking  though less opportunity  because mr  williams has got a large parcel of my papers  safe in his hands to send them to you  as he has opportunity  so i am not quite uselessly employed  and i am delivered besides  from the fear of their being found  if i should be searched  or discovered  i have been permitted to take an airing  five or six miles  with mrs  jewkes  but  though i know not the reason  she watches me more closely than ever  so that we have discontinued  by consent  for these three days  the sunflower correspondence the poor cook maid has had a bad mischance  for she has been hurt much by a bull in the pasture  by the side of the garden  not far from the back door  now this pasture i am to cross  which is about half a mile and then is a common  and near that a private horse road  where i hope to find an opportunity for escaping  as soon as mr  williams can get me a horse  and has made all ready for me  for he has got me the key  which he put under the mould  just by the door  as he found an opportunity to hint to me he just now has signified  that the gentleman is dead  whose living he has had hope of  and he came pretendedly to tell mrs  jewkes of it  and so could speak this to her before me  she wished him joy  see what the world is  one man s death is another man s joy  thus we thrust out one another my hard case makes me serious  he found means to slide a letter into my hands  and is gone away  he looked at me with such respect and solemness at parting  that mrs  jewkes said  why  madam i believe our young parson is half in love with you ah  mrs  jewkes said i  he knows better  said she  i believe to sound me  why  i can t see you can either of you do better  and i have lately been so touched for you  seeing how heavily you apprehend dishonour from my master  that i think it is pity you should not have mr  williams i knew this must be a fetch of hers  because  instead of being troubled for me  as she pretended  she watched me closer  and him too  and so i said  there is not the man living that i desire to marry  if i can but keep myself honest  it is all my desire  and to be a comfort and assistance to my poor parents  if it should be my happy lot to be so  is the very top of my ambition  well  but  said she  i have been thinking very seriously  that mr  williams would make you a good husband  and as he will owe all his fortune to my master  he will be very glad  to be sure  to be obliged to him for a wife of his choosing  especially  said she  such a pretty one  and one so ingenious  and genteelly educated this gave me a doubt  whether she knew of my master s intimation of that sort formerly  and i asked her  if she had reason to surmise that that was in view  no  she said  it was only her own thought  but it was very likely that my master had either that in view  or something better for me  but  if i approved of it  she would propose such a thing to her master directly  and gave a detestable hint  that i might take resolutions upon it  of bringing such an affair to effect  i told her i abhorred her vile insinuation  and as to mr  williams  i thought him a civil good sort of man  but  as on one side  he was above me  so  on the other  i said of all things i did not love a parson  so  finding she could make nothing of me  she quitted the subject  i will open his letter by and by  and give you the contents of it  for she is up and down so much  that i am afraid of her surprising me well  i see providence has not abandoned me  i shall be under no necessity to make advances to mr  williams  if i was as i am sure i am not  disposed to it  this is his letter i know not how to express myself  lest i should appear to you to have a selfish view in the service i would do you  but i really know but one effectual and honourable way to disengage yourself from the dangerous situation you are in  it is that of marriage with some person that you could make happy in your approbation  as for my own part  it would be as things stand  my apparent ruin  and  worse still  i should involve you in misery too  but  yet  so great is my veneration for you  and so entire my reliance on providence  upon so just an occasion  that i should think myself but too happy  if i might be accepted  i would  in this case  forego all my expectations  and be your conductor to some safe distance  but why do i say  in this case  that i will do  whether you think fit to reward me so eminently or not  and i will  the moment i hear of mr  b s setting out  and i think now i have settled a very good method of intelligence of all his motions  get a horse ready and myself to conduct you  i refer myself wholly to your goodness and direction  and am  with the highest respect                              your most faithful humble servant don t think this a sudden resolution  i always admired your hear say character  and the moment i saw you  wished to serve so much excellence what shall i say  my dear father and mother  to this unexpected declaration  i want  now  more than ever  your blessing and direction but  after all  i have no mind to marry  i had rather live with you  but yet  i would marry a man who begs from door to door  and has no home nor being  rather than endanger my honesty  yet i cannot  methinks  hear of being a wife after a thousand different thoughts  i wrote as follows reverend sir i am greatly confused at the contents of your last  you are much too generous  and i can t bear you should risk all your future prospects for so unworthy a creature  i cannot think of your offer without equal concern and gratitude  for nothing  but to avoid my utter ruin  can make me think of a change of condition  and so  sir  you ought not to accept of such an involuntary compliance  as mine would be  were i  upon the last necessity  to yield to your very generous proposal  i will rely wholly upon your goodness to me  in assisting my escape  but shall not on your account principally  think of the honour you propose for me at present  and never  but at the pleasure of my parents  who  poor as they are  in such a weighty point  are as much entitled to my obedience and duty  as if they were ever so rich  i beg you  therefore  sir  not to think of any thing from me  but everlasting gratitude  which shall always bind me to be your most obliged servant thursday  friday  saturday  the th  th  and th  of my bondage mrs  jewkes has received a letter  and is much civiller to me  and mr williams too  than she used to be  i wonder i have not one in answer to mine to my master  i suppose i put the matter too home to him  and he is angry  i am not the more pleased with her civility  for she is horrid cunning  and is not a whit less watchful  i laid a trap to get at her instructions  which she carries in the bosom of her stays  but it has not succeeded my last letter is come safe to mr  williams by the old conveyance  so that he is not suspected  he has intimated  that though i have not come so readily as he hoped into his scheme  yet his diligence shall not be slackened  and he will leave it to providence and himself to dispose of him as he shall be found to deserve  he has signified to me  that he shall soon send a special messenger with the packet to you  and i have added to it what has occurred since sunday i am just now quite astonished i hope all is right but i have a strange turn to acquaint you with  mr  williams and mrs  jewkes came to me both together  he in ecstacies  she with a strange fluttering sort of air  well  said she  mrs  pamela  i give you joy  i give you joy let nobody speak but me  then she sat down  as out of breath  puffing and blowing  why  every thing turns as i said it would  said she  why  there is to be a match between you and mr  williams  well  i always thought it  never was so good a master go to  go to  naughty  mistrustful mrs pamela  nay  mrs  williams  said the forward creature  i may as good call you  you ought on your knees to beg his pardon a thousand times for mistrusting him she was going on  but i said  don t torture me thus  i beseech you mrs  jewkes  let me know all ah  mr  williams  said i  take care  take care mistrustful again  said she  why  mr  williams  shew her your letter  and i will shew her mine  they were brought by the same hand i trembled at the thoughts of what this might mean  and said  you have so surprised me  that i cannot stand  nor hear  nor read  why did you come up in such a manner to attack such weak spirits  said he  to mrs jewkes  shall we leave our letters with mrs  pamela  and let her recover from her surprise  ay  said she  with all my heart  here is nothing but flaming honour and good will  and so saying  they left me their letters and withdrew my heart was quite sick with the surprise  so that i could not presently read them  notwithstanding my impatience  but  after a while recovering  i found the contents thus strange and unexpected mr  williams the death of mr  fownes has now given me the opportunity i have long wanted  to make you happy  and that in a double respect  for i shall soon put you in possession of his living  and  if you have the art of making yourself well received  of one of the loveliest wives in england she has not been used as she has reason to think  according to her merit  but when she finds herself under the protection of a man of virtue and probity  and a happy competency to support life in the manner to which she has been of late years accustomed  i am persuaded she will forgive those seeming hardships which have paved the way to so happy a lot  as i hope it will be to you both  i have only to account for and excuse the odd conduct i have been guilty of  which i shall do when i see you  but as i shall soon set out for london  i believe it will not be yet this month  mean time  if you can prevail with pamela  you need not suspend for that your mutual happiness  only let me have notice of it first  and that she approves of it  which ought to be  in so material a point  entirely at her option  as i assure you  on the other hand i would have it at yours  that nothing may be wanting to complete your happiness                                    i am your humble servant was ever the like heard lie still  my throbbing heart  divided as thou art  between thy hopes and thy fears but this is the letter mrs jewkes left with me mrs  jewkes you have been very careful and diligent in the task  which  for reasons i shall hereafter explain  i had imposed upon you  your trouble is now almost at an end  for i have written my intentions to mr  williams so particularly  that i need say the less here  because he will not scruple  i believe  to let you know the contents of my letter  i have only one thing to mention  that if you find what i have hinted to him in the least measure disagreeable to either  you assure them both  that they are at entire liberty to pursue their own inclinations  i hope you continue your civilities to the mistrustful  uneasy pamela  who now will begin to think better of hers and your friend  etc i had hardly time to transcribe these letters  though  writing so much i write pretty fast  before they both came up again in high spirits  and mr  williams said  i am glad at my heart  madam  that i was beforehand in my declarations to you  this generous letter has made me the happiest man on earth  and  mrs  jewkes  you may be sure  that if i can procure this fair one s consent  i shall think myself i interrupted the good man  and said  ah  mr  williams  take care  take care  don t let there i stopt  and mrs  jewkes said  still mistrustful i never saw the like in my life but i see  said she  i was not wrong  while my old orders lasted  to be wary of you both i should have had a hard task to prevent you  i find  for  as the saying is  nought can restrain consent of twain i doubted not her taking hold of his joyful indiscretion i took her letter  and said  here  mrs  jewkes  is yours  i thank you for it  but i have been so long in a maze  that i can say nothing of this for the present  time will bring all to light sir  said i  here is yours may every thing turn to your happiness  i give you joy of my master s goodness in the living it will be dying  said he  not a living without you forbear  sir  said i  while i have a father and mother  i am not my own mistress  poor as they are  and i ll see myself quite at liberty  before i shall think myself fit to make a choice mrs  jewkes held up her eyes and hands  and said  such art  such caution  such cunning  for thy years well why  said i  that he might be more on his guard  though i hope there cannot be deceit in this  twould be strange villany  and that is a hard word  if there should  i have been so used to be made a fool of by fortune  that i hardly can tell how to govern myself  and am almost an infidel as to mankind  but i hope i may be wrong  henceforth  mrs  jewkes  you shall regulate my opinions as you please  and i will consult you in every thing that i think proper  said i to myself for  to be sure  though i may forgive her  i can never love her she left mr  williams and me  a few minutes  together  and i said consider  sir  consider what you have done  tis impossible  said he there can be deceit  i hope so  said i  but what necessity was there for you to talk of your former declaration  let this be as it will  that could do no good  especially before this woman  forgive me  sir  they talk of women s promptness of speech  but  indeed  i see an honest heart is not always to be trusted with itself in bad company he was going to reply  but though her task is said to be almost i took notice of that word  at an end  she came up to us again  and said  well i had a good mind to show you the way to church to morrow  i was glad of this  because  though in my present doubtful situation i should not have chosen it  yet i would have encouraged her proposal  to be able to judge by her being in earnest or otherwise  whether one might depend upon the rest  but mr  williams again indiscreetly helped her to an excuse  by saying  that it was now best to defer it one sunday  and till matters were riper for my appearance  and she readily took hold of it  and confirmed his opinion after all  i hope the best  but if this should turn out to be a plot i fear nothing but a miracle can save me  but  sure the heart of man is not capable of such black deceit  besides  mr  williams has it under his own hand  and he dare not but be in earnest  and then again  though to be sure he has been very wrong to me  yet his education  and parents example  have neither of them taught him such very black contrivances so i will hope for the best mr  williams  mrs  jewkes  and i  have been all three walking together in the garden  and she pulled out her key  and we walked a little in the pasture to look at the bull  an ugly  grim  surly creature  that hurt the poor cook maid  who is got pretty well again  mr  williams pointed at the sunflower  but i was forced to be very reserved to him  for the poor gentleman has no guard  no caution at all we have just supped together  all three  and i cannot yet think that all must be right only i am resolved not to marry  if i can help it  and i will give no encouragement  i am resolved  at least  till i am with you mr  williams said  before mrs  jewkes  he would send a messenger with a letter to my father and mother i think the man has no discretion in the world  but l desire you will send no answer  till i have the pleasure and happiness which now i hope for soon  of seeing you  he will  in sending my packet  send a most tedious parcel of stuff  of my oppressions  my distresses  my fears  and so i will send this with it for mrs  jewkes gives me leave to send a letter to my father  which looks well  and i am glad i can conclude  after all my sufferings  with my hopes  to be soon with you  which i know will give you comfort  and so i rest  begging the continuance of your prayers and blessings                                      your ever dutiful daughter my dear father and mother i have so much time upon my hands that i must write on  to employ myself  the sunday evening  where i left off  mrs  jewkes asked me  if i chose to be by myself  i said  yes  with all my heart  if she pleased well  said she  after to night you shall  i asked her for more paper and she gave me a bottle of ink  eight sheets of paper  which she said was all her store  for now she would get me to write for her to our master  if she had occasion  and six pens  with a piece of sealing wax this looks mighty well she pressed me  when she came to bed  very much  to give encouragement to mr  williams  and said many things in his behalf  and blamed my shyness to him  i told her  i was resolved to give no encouragement till i had talked to my father and mother  she said  he fancied i thought of somebody else  or i could never be so insensible  i assured her  as i could do very safely  that there was not a man on earth i wished to have  and as to mr  williams  he might do better by far  and i had proposed so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother that i could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure  till i had tried that  i asked her for my money  and she said  it was above in her strong box  but that i should have it to morrow  all these things look well  as i said mr  williams would go home this night  though late  because he would despatch a messenger to you with a letter he had proposed from himself and my packet  but pray don t encourage him  as i said  for he is much too heady and precipitate as to this matter  in my way of thinking though  to be sure  he is a very good man  and i am much obliged to him monday morning alas a day  we have bad news from poor mr  williams  he has had a sad mischance  fallen among rogues in his way home last night  but by good chance has saved my papers  this is the account he gives of it to mrs jewkes good mrs  jewkes i have had a sore misfortune in going from you  when i had got as near the town as the dam  and was going to cross the wooden bridge  two fellows got hold of me  and swore bitterly they would kill me  if i did not give them what i had  they rummaged my pockets  and took from me my snuff box  my seal ring  and half a guinea  and some silver  and halfpence  also my handkerchief  and two or three letters i had in my pockets  by good fortune  the letter mrs  pamela gave me was in my bosom  and so that escaped but they bruised my head and face  and cursing me for having no more money  tipped me into the dam  crying  be there  parson  till to morrow  my shins and knees were bruised much in the fall against one of the stumps  and i had like to have been suffocated in water and mud  to be sure  i shan t be able to stir out this day or two  for i am a frightful spectacle  my hat and wig i was forced to leave behind me  and go home  a mile and a half  without  but they were found next morning  and brought me  with my snuff box  which the rogues must have dropped  my cassock is sadly torn  as is my band to be sure  i was much frightened  for a robbery in these parts has not been known many years  diligent search is making after the rogues  my humble respects to good mrs  pamela  if she pities my misfortunes  i shall be the sooner well  and fit to wait on her and you  this did not hinder me in writing a letter  though with great pain  as i do this  to be sure this good man can keep no secret  and sending it away by a man and horse  this morning  i am  good mrs  jewkes                             your most obliged humble servant god be praised it is no worse  and i find i have got no cold  though miserably wet from top to toe  my fright  i believe  prevented me from catching cold  for i was not rightly myself for some hours  and know not how i got home  i will write a letter of thanks this night  if i am able  to my kind patron  for his inestimable goodness to me  i wish i was enabled to say all i hope  with regard to the better part of his bounty to me  incomparable mrs  pamela the wicked brute fell a laughing  when she had read this letter  till her fat sides shook  said she  i can but think how the poor parson looked  after parting with his pretty mistress in such high spirits when he found himself at the bottom of the dam  and what a figure he must cut in his tattered band and cassock  and without a hat and wig when he got home  i warrant  added she  he was in a sweet pickle i said  i thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune  but she replied  as he was safe  she laughed  otherwise she would have been sorry  and she was glad to see me so concerned for him it looked promising  she said i heeded not her reflections  but as i have been used to causes for mistrusts  i cannot help saying  that i don t like this thing  and their taking his letters most alarms me how happy it was they missed my packet  i knew not what to think of it but why should i let every accident break my peace  yet it will do so  while i stay here mrs  jewkes is mightily at me  to go with her in the chariot  to visit mr  williams  she is so officious to bring on the affair between us that  being a cunning  artful woman  i know not what to make of it  i have refused her absolutely  urging  that except i intended to encourage his suit  i ought not to do it  and she is gone without me i have strange temptations to get away in her absence  for all these fine appearances  tis sad to have nobody to advise with i know not what to do  but  alas for me  i have no money  if i should  to buy any body s civilities  or to pay for necessaries or lodgings  but i ll go into the garden  and resolve afterwards i have been in the garden  and to the back door  and there i stood  my heart up at my mouth  i could not see i was watched  so this looks well  but if any thing should go bad afterwards  i should never forgive myself  for not taking this opportunity  well  i will go down again and see if all is clear  and how it looks out at the back door in the pasture to be sure  there is witchcraft in this house  and i believe lucifer is bribed  as well as all about me  and is got into the shape of that nasty grim bull to watch me for i have been again  and ventured to open the door  and went out about a bow shot into the pasture  but there stood that horrid bull  staring me full in the face  with fiery saucer eyes as i thought  so i got in again  for fear he should come at me  nobody saw me  however do you think there are such things as witches and spirits  if there be  i believe  in my heart  mrs  jewkes has got this bull of her side  but yet  what could i do without money  or a friend o this wicked woman  to trick me so  every thing  man  woman and beast  is in a plot against your poor pamela  i think then i know not one step of the way  nor how far to any house or cottage and whether i could gain protection  if i got to a house  and now the robbers are abroad too  i may run into as great danger as i want to escape  nay  greater much  if these promising appearances hold  and sure my master cannot be so black as that they should not what can i do i have a good mind to try for it once more  but then i may be pursued and taken  and it will be worse for me  and this wicked woman will beat me and take my shoes away  and lock me up but  after all  if my master should mean well  he can t be angry at my fears  if i should escape  and nobody can blame me  and i can more easily be induced  with you  when all my apprehensions are over to consider his proposal of mr  williams  than i could here  and he pretends  as you have read in his letter  he will leave me to my choice why then should i be afraid  i will go down again  i think  but yet my heart misgives me  because of the difficulties before me  in escaping and being so poor and so friendless o good god  the preserver of the innocent  direct me what to do well  i have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me  that i ought to try to get way  and leave the issue to providence  so  once more i ll see  at least  if this bull be still there alack a day  what a fate is this  i have not the courage to go  neither can i think to stay  but i must resolve  the gardener was in sight last time  so made me come up again  but i ll contrive to send him out of the way  if i can for if i never should have such another opportunity i could not forgive myself  once more i ll venture  god direct my footsteps  and make smooth my path and my way to safety well  here i am  come back again  frightened  like a fool  out of all my purposes  o how terrible every thing appears to me  i had got twice as far again  as i was before  out of the back door  and i looked and saw the bull  as i thought  between me and the door  and another bull coming towards me the other way  well  thought i  here is double witchcraft  to be sure  here is the spirit of my master in one bull  and mrs  jewkes s in the other  and now i am gone  to be sure  o help  cried i  like a fool  and ran back to the door  as swift as if i flew  when i had got the door in my hand  i ventured to look back  to see if these supposed bulls were coming  and i saw they were only two poor cows  a grazing in distant places  that my fears had made all this rout about  but as every thing is so frightful to me  i find i am not fit to think of my escape for i shall be as much frightened at the first strange man that i meet with  and i am persuaded that fear brings one into more dangers  than the caution  that goes along with it  delivers one from i then locked the door  and put the key in my pocket  and was in a sad quandary  but i was soon determined  for the maid nan came in sight and asked  if any thing was the matter  that i was so often up and down stairs  god forgive me  but i had a sad lie at my tongue s end  said i  though mrs  jewkes is sometimes a little hard upon me  yet i know not where i am without her  i go up  and i come down to walk about in the garden  and  not having her  know scarcely what to do with myself  ay said the ideot  she is main good company  madam  no wonder you miss her so here i am again  and here likely to be  for i have no courage to help myself any where else  o why are poor foolish maidens tried with such dangers  when they have such weak minds to grapple with them i will  since it is so  hope the best  but yet i cannot but observe how grievously every thing makes against me  for here are the robbers though i fell not into their hands myself  yet they gave me as much terror  and had as great an effect upon my fears  as if i had  and here is the bull  it has as effectually frightened me  as if i had been hurt by it instead of the cook maid  and so these joined together  as i may say  to make a very dastard of me  but my folly was the worst of all because that deprived me of my money  for had i had that  i believe i should have ventured both the bull and the robbers monday afternoon so  mrs  jewkes is returned from her visit  well  said she  i would have you set your heart at rest  for mr  williams will do very well again  he is not half so bad as he fancied  o these scholars  said she  they have not the hearts of mice  he has only a few scratches on his face  which said she  i suppose he got by grappling among the gravel at the bottom of the dam  to try to find a hole in the ground  to hide himself from the robbers  his shin and his knee are hardly to be seen to ail any thing  he says in his letter  he was a frightful spectacle  he might be so  indeed  when he first came in a doors  but he looks well enough now and  only for a few groans now and then  when he thinks of his danger i see nothing is the matter with him  so  mrs  pamela  said she  i would have you be very easy about it  i am glad of it  said i  for all your jokes  to mrs  jewkes well  said she  he talks of nothing but you  and when i told him i would fain have persuaded you to come with me  the man was out of his wits with his gratitude to me  and so has laid open all his heart to me  and told me all that has passed  and was contriving between you two  this alarmed me prodigiously  and the rather  as i saw  by two or three instances  that his honest heart could keep nothing  believing every one as undesigning as himself  i said  but yet with a heavy heart  ah  mrs jewkes  mrs  jewkes  this might have done with me  had he had any thing that he could have told you of  but you know well enough  that had we been disposed  we had no opportunity for it  from your watchful care and circumspection  no  said she  that s very true  mrs  pamela  not so much as for that declaration that he owned before me  he had found opportunity  for all my watchfulness  to make you  come  come  said she no more of these shams with me  you have an excellent head piece for your years  but may be i am as cunning as you however  said she all is well now  because my watchments are now over  by my master s direction  how have you employed yourself in my absence i was so troubled at what might have passed between mr  williams and her  that i could not hide it  and she said  well  mrs  pamela  since all matters are likely to be so soon and so happily ended  let me advise you to be a little less concerned at his discoveries  and make me your confidant  as he has done  and i shall think you have some favour for me  and reliance upon me  and perhaps you might not repent it she was so earnest  that i mistrusted she did this to pump me  and i knew how  now  to account for her kindness to mr  williams in her visit to him  which was only to get out of him what she could  why  mrs jewkes  said i  is all this fishing about for something  where there is nothing  if there be an end of your watchments  as you call them nothing  said she  but womanish curiosity  i ll assure you  for one is naturally led to find out matters  where there is such privacy intended well  said i  pray let me know what he has said  and then i ll give you an answer to your curiosity  i don t care  said she  whether you do or not for i have as much as i wanted from him  and i despair of getting out of you any thing you ha n t a mind i should know  my little cunning dear well  said i  let him have said what he would  i care not  for i am sure he can say no harm of me  and so let us change the talk i was the easier  indeed  because  for all her pumps  she gave no hints of the key and the door  etc  which  had he communicated to her  she would not have forborne giving me a touch of and so we gave up one another  as despairing to gain our ends of each other  but i am sure he must have said more than he should and i am the more apprehensive all is not right  because she has now been actually  these two hours  shut up a writing  though she pretended she had given me up all her stores of papers  etc  and that i should write for her  i begin to wish i had ventured every thing and gone off  when i might  o when will this state of doubt and uneasiness end she has just been with me  and says she shall send a messenger to bedfordshire  and he shall carry a letter of thanks for me  if i will write it for my master s favour to me  indeed  said i  i have no thanks to give  till i am with my father and mother  and besides  i sent a letter  as you know  but have had no answer to it  she said  she thought that his letter to mr  williams was sufficient  and the least i could do was to thank him  if but in two lines  no need of it  said i  for i don t intend to have mr  williams  what then is that letter to me  well said she  i see thou art quite unfathomable i don t like all this  o my foolish fears of bulls and robbers for now all my uneasiness begins to double upon me  o what has this incautious man said  that  no doubt  is the subject of her long letter i will close this day s writing  with just saying  that she is mighty silent and reserved  to what she was  and says nothing but no  or yes to what i ask  something must be hatching  i doubt i the rather think so  because i find she does not keep her word with me  about lying by myself  and my money  to both which points she returned suspicious answers  saying  as to the one  why  you are mighty earnest for your money  i shan t run away with it  and to the other  good lack  you need not be so willing  as i know of  to part with me for a bed fellow  till you are sure of one you like better  this cut me to the heart  and  at the same time  stopped my mouth tuesday  wednesday mr  williams has been here  but we have had no opportunity to talk together  he seemed confounded at mrs  jewkes s change of temper  and reservedness  after her kind visit  and their freedom with one another and much more at what i am going to tell you  he asked  if i would take a turn in the garden with mrs  jewkes and him  no  said she  i can t go said he  may not mrs  pamela take a walk no  said she  i desire she won t  why  mrs  jewkes  said he  i am afraid i have somehow disobliged you  not at all  replied she  but i suppose you will soon be at liberty to walk together as much as you please  and i have sent a messenger for my last instructions  about this and more weighty matters  and when they come i shall leave you to do as you both will  but  till then  it is no matter how little you are together  this alarmed us both  and he seemed quite struck of a heap  and put on  as i thought  a self accusing countenance  so i went behind her back  and held my two hands together flat  with a bit of paper  i had  between them  and looked at him and he seemed to take me as i intended  intimating the renewing of the correspondence by the tiles i left them both together  and retired to my closet to write a letter for the tiles  but having no time for a copy  i will give you the substance only i expostulated with him on his too great openness and easiness to fall into mrs  jewkes s snares  told him my apprehensions of foul play  and gave briefly the reasons which moved me  begged to know what he had said  and intimated  that i thought there was the highest reason to resume our prospect of the escape by the back door  i put this in the usual place in the evening  and now wait with impatience for an answer thursday i have the following answer dearest madam i am utterly confounded  and must plead guilty to all your just reproaches  i wish i were master of all but half your caution and discretion  i hope  after all  this is only a touch of this ill woman s temper  to shew her power and importance  for i think mr  b  neither can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner  i would expose him all the world over if he did  but it is not  cannot be in him  i have received a letter from john arnold  in which he tells me  that his master is preparing for his london journey  and believes  afterwards  he will come into these parts  but he says  lady davers is at their house  and is to accompany her brother to london  or meet him there  he knows not which he professes great zeal and affection to your service  and i find he refers to a letter he sent me before  but which is not come to my hand i think there can be no treachery  for it is a particular friend at gainsborough  that i have ordered him to direct to  and this is come safe to my hands by this means  for well i know  i durst trust nothing to brett  at the post house here  this gives me a little pain  but i hope all will end well  and we shall soon hear  if it be necessary to pursue our former intentions  if it be  i will lose no time to provide a horse for you  and another for myself  for i can never do either god or myself better service  though i were to forego all my expectations for it here  i am your most faithful humble servant i was too free indeed with mrs  jewkes  led to it by her dissimulation and by her pretended concern to make me happy with you  i hinted  that i would not have scrupled to have procured your deliverance by any means and that i had proposed to you  as the only honourable one  marriage with me  but i assured her  though she would hardly believe me  that you discouraged my application  which is too true  but not a word of the back door key  etc mrs  jewkes continues still sullen and ill natured  and i am almost afraid to speak to her  she watches me as close as ever  and pretends to wonder why i shun her company as i do i have just put under the tiles these lines inspired by my fears  which are indeed very strong  and  i doubt  not without reason sir every thing gives me additional disturbance  the missed letter of john arnold s makes me suspect a plot  yet am i loath to think myself of so much importance  as to suppose every one in a plot against me  are you sure  however  the london journey is not to be a lincolnshire one  may not john  who has been once a traitor  be so again why need i be thus in doubt if i could have this horse  i would turn the reins on his neck  and trust to providence to guide him for my safeguard  for i would not endanger you  now just upon the edge of your preferment  yet  sir  i fear your fatal openness will make you suspected as accessary  let us be ever so cautious were my life in question  instead of my honesty  i would not wish to involve you  or any body  in the least difficulty  for so worthless a poor creature  but  o sir  my soul is of equal importance with the soul of a princess  though my quality is inferior to that of the meanest slave save then my innocence  good heaven  and preserve my mind spotless  and happy shall i be to lay down my worthless life  and see an end to all my troubles and anxieties forgive my impatience  but my presaging mind bodes horrid mischiefs every thing looks dark around me  and this woman s impenetrable sullenness and silence  without any apparent reason  from a conduct so very contrary  bid me fear the worst blame me  sir  if you think me wrong  and let me have your advice what to do  which will oblige                                         your most afflicted servant friday i have this half angry answer  but  what is more to me than all the letters in the world could be  yours  my dear father  enclosed madam i think you are too apprehensive by much  i am sorry for your uneasiness  you may depend upon me  and all i can do  but i make no doubt of the london journey  nor of john s contrition and fidelity i have just received  from my gainsborough friend  this letter  as i suppose  from your good father  in a cover  directed for me  as i had desired  i hope it contains nothing to add to your uneasiness  pray dearest madam  lay aside your fears  and wait a few days for the issue of mrs  jewkes s letter  and mine of thanks to mr  b  things  i hope  must be better than you expect  providence will not desert such piety and innocence  and be this your comfort and reliance  which is the best advice that can at present be given  by                               your most faithful humble servant n  b  the father s letter was as follows my dearest daughter our prayers are at length heard  and we are overwhelmed with joy  o what sufferings  what trials  hast thou gone through  blessed be the divine goodness  which has enabled thee to withstand so many temptations  we have not yet had leisure to read through your long accounts of all your hardships  i say long  because i wonder how you could find time and opportunity for them  but otherwise they are the delight of our spare hours  and we shall read them over and over  as long as we live  with thankfulness to god  who has given us so virtuous and so discreet a daughter  how happy is our lot in the midst of our poverty  o let none ever think children a burden to them  when the poorest circumstances can produce so much riches in a pamela  persist my dear daughter  in the same excellent course  and we shall not envy the highest estate  but defy them to produce such a daughter as ours i said  we had not read through all yours in course  we were too impatient  and so turned to the end  where we find your virtue within view of its reward  and your master s heart turned to see the folly of his ways  and the injury he had intended to our dear child  for  to be sure  my dear  he would have ruined you  if he could  but seeing your virtue  his heart is touched  and he has  no doubt  been awakened by your good example we don t see that you can do any way so well  as to come into the present proposal  and make mr  williams  the worthy mr  williams  god bless him happy  and though we are poor  and can add no merit  no reputation  no fortune  to our dear child  but rather must be a disgrace to her  as the world will think  yet i hope i do not sin in my pride  to say  that there is no good man  of a common degree  especially as your late lady s kindness gave you such good opportunities  which you have had the grace to improve  but may think himself happy in you  but  as you say  you had rather not marry at present  far be it from us to offer violence to your inclination  so much prudence as you have shewn in all your conduct  would make it very wrong in us to mistrust it in this  or to offer to direct you in your choice  but  alas  my child  what can we do for you to partake our hard lot  and involve yourself into as hard a life  would not help us  but add to your afflictions  but it will be time enough to talk of these things  when we have the pleasure you now put us in hope of  of seeing you with us  which god grant  amen  amen say your most indulgent parents  amen our humblest service and thanks to the worthy mr  williams  again we say  god bless him for ever o what a deal we have to say to you  god give us a happy meeting we understand the squire is setting out for london  he is a fine gentleman  and has wit at will  i wish he was as good  but i hope he will now reform o what inexpressible comfort  my dear father  has your letter given me you ask  what can you do for me what is it you cannot do for your child you can give her the advice she has so much wanted  and still wants  and will always want  you can confirm her in the paths of virtue into which you first initiated her  and you can pray for her  with hearts so sincere and pure  that are not to be met with in palaces oh how i long to throw myself at your feet  and receive from your own lips the blessings of such good parents  but  alas  how are my prospects again overclouded  to what they were when i closed my last parcel more trials  more dangers  i fear  must your poor pamela be engaged in  but through the divine goodness  and your prayers  i hope  at last  to get well out of all my difficulties  and the rather  as they are not the effect of my own vanity or presumption but i will proceed with my hopeless story  i saw mr  williams was a little nettled at my impatience  and so i wrote to assure him i would be as easy as i could  and wholly directed by him  especially as my father whose respects i mentioned  had assured me my master was setting out for london  which he must have somehow from his own family or he would not have written me word of it saturday  sunday mr  williams has been here both these days  as usual  but is very indifferently received still by mrs  jewkes  and  to avoid suspicion i left them together  and went up to my closet  most of the time he was here  he and she  i found by her  had a quarrel  and she seems quite out of humour with him  but i thought it best not to say any thing  and he said  he would very little trouble the house till he had an answer to his letter from mr  b  and she returned  the less  the better poor man  he has got but little by his openness  making mrs  jewkes his confidant  as she bragged  and would have had me to do likewise i am more and more satisfied there is mischief brewing  and shall begin to hide my papers  and be circumspect  she seems mighty impatient for an answer to her letter to my master monday  tuesday  the th and th days of my heavy restraint still more and more strange things to write  a messenger is returned and now all is out  o wretched  wretched pamela  what  at last  will become of me such strange turns and trials sure never poor creature of my years  experienced  he brought two letters  one to mrs  jewkes and one to me  but  as the greatest wits may be sometimes mistaken  they being folded and sealed alike  that for me was directed to mrs jewkes  and that for her was directed to me  but both are stark naught abominably bad  she brought me up that directed for me  and said here s a letter for you  long looked for is come at last  i will ask the messenger a few questions  and then i will read mine  so she went down and i broke it open in my closet  and found it directed to mrs  pamela andrews  but when i opened it  it began  mrs  jewkes  i was quite confounded  but  thought i  this may be a lucky mistake  i may discover something  and so i read on these horrid contents mrs  jewkes what you write me  has given me no small disturbance  this wretched fool s play thing  no doubt  is ready to leap at any thing that offers rather than express the least sense of gratitude for all the benefits she has received from my family  and which i was determined more and more to heap upon her  i reserve her for my future resentment  and i charge you double your diligence in watching her  to prevent her escape i send this by an honest swiss  who attended me in my travels  a man i can trust  and so let him be your assistant  for the artful creature is enough to corrupt a nation by her seeming innocence and simplicity  and she may have got a party  perhaps  among my servants with you  as she has here  even john arnold  whom i confided in  and favoured more than any  has proved an execrable villain  and shall meet his reward for it as to that college novice  williams  i need not bid you take care he sees not this painted bauble  for i have ordered mr  shorter  my attorney  to throw him instantly into gaol  on an action of debt  for money he has had of me  which i had intended never to carry to account against him  for i know all his rascally practices  besides what you write me of his perfidious intrigue with that girl  and his acknowledged contrivances for her escape  when he knew not  for certain  that i designed her any mischief  and when  if he had been guided by a sense of piety  or compassion for injured innocence  as he pretends  he would have expostulated with me  as his function  and my friendship for him might have allowed him  but to enter into a vile intrigue with the amiable gewgaw  to favour her escape in so base a manner  to say nothing of his disgraceful practices against me  in sir simon darnford s family  of which sir simon himself has informed me  is a conduct that instead of preferring the ungrateful wretch  as i had intended  shall pull down upon him utter ruin monsieur colbrand  my trusty swiss  will obey you without reserve  if my other servants refuse as for her denying that she encouraged his declaration  i believe it not  it is certain the speaking picture  with all that pretended innocence and bashfulness  would have run away with him  yes  she would run away with a fellow that she had been acquainted with and that not intimately  if you were as careful as you ought to be  but a few days at a time when she had the strongest assurances of my honour to her well  i think  i now hate her perfectly  and though i will do nothing to her myself  yet i can bear  for the sake of my revenge  and my injured honour and slighted love  to see any thing  even what she most fears  be done to her  and then she may be turned loose to her evil destiny  and echo to the woods and groves her piteous lamentations for the loss of her fantastical innocence  which the romantic ideot makes such a work about  i shall go to london  with my sister davers  and the moment i can disengage myself  which  perhaps  may be in three weeks from this time  i will be with you  and decide her fate  and put an end to your trouble  mean time be doubly careful  for this innocent  as i have warned you  is full of contrivances  i am your friend i had but just read this dreadful letter through  when mrs  jewkes came up in a great fright  guessing at the mistake  and that i had her letter  and she found me with it open in my hand  just sinking away what business  said she  had you to read my letter  and snatched it from me  you see  said she  looking upon it  it says mrs  jewkes  at top you ought  in manners  to have read no further  o add not  said i  to my afflictions  i shall be soon out of all your ways  this is too much  too much  i never can support this and threw myself upon the couch  in my closet  and wept most bitterly  she read it in the next room  and came in again afterwards  why  this  said she  is a sad letter indeed  i am sorry for it  but i feared you would carry your niceties too far leave me  leave me  mrs  jewkes  said i  for a while  i cannot speak nor talk poor heart  said she  well  i ll come up again presently  and hope to find you better  but here  take your own letter  i wish you well  but this is a sad mistake  and so she put down by me that which was intended for me  but i have no spirit to read it at present  o man man  hard hearted  cruel man  what mischiefs art thou not capable of unrelenting persecutor as thou art i sat ruminating  when i had a little come to myself  upon the terms of this wicked letter  and had no inclination to look into my own  the bad names  fool s play thing  artful creature  painted bauble  gewgaw speaking picture  are hard words for your poor pamela  and i began to think whether i was not indeed a very naughty body  and had not done vile things  but when i thought of his having discovered poor john  and of sir simon s base officiousness  in telling him of mr  williams  with what he had resolved against him in revenge for his goodness to me  i was quite dispirited  and yet still more about that fearful colbrand and what he could see done to me  for then i was ready to gasp for breath  and my heart quite failed me  then how dreadful are the words that he will decide my fate in three weeks  gracious heaven  said i strike me dead  before that time  with a thunderbolt  or provide some way for my escaping these threatened mischiefs  god forgive me  if i sinned at last  i took up the letter directed for mrs  jewkes  but designed for me  and i find that little better than the other  these are the hard terms it contains well have you done  perverse  forward  artful  yet foolish pamela to convince me  before it was too late  how ill i had done to place my affections on so unworthy an object  i had vowed honour and love to your unworthiness  believing you a mirror of bashful modesty and unspotted innocence  and that no perfidious designs lurked in so fair a bosom  but now i have found you out  you specious hypocrite  and i see  that though you could not repose the least confidence in one you had known for years  and who  under my good mother s misplaced favour for you  had grown up in a manner with you  when my passion  in spite of my pride and the difference of our condition  made me stoop to a meanness that now i despise myself for  yet you could enter into an intrigue with a man you never knew till within these few days past  and resolve to run away with a stranger  whom your fair face  and insinuating arts  had bewitched to break through all the ties of honour and gratitude to me even at a time when the happiness of his future life depended upon my favour henceforth  for pamela s sake  whenever i see a lovely face  will i mistrust a deceitful heart  and whenever i hear of the greatest pretences to innocence  will i suspect some deep laid mischief  you were determined to place no confidence in me  though i have solemnly  over and over  engaged my honour to you  what  though i had alarmed your fears in sending you one way  when you hoped to go another  yet  had i not  to convince you of my resolution to do justly by you  although with great reluctance  such then was my love for you  engaged not to come near you without your own consent  was not this a voluntary demonstration of the generosity of my intention to you  yet how have you requited me  the very first fellow that your charming face  and insinuating address  could influence  you have practised upon  corrupted too  i may say  and even ruined  as the ungrateful wretch shall find and thrown your forward self upon him  as  therefore  you would place no confidence in me  my honour owes you nothing  and  in a little time  you shall find how much you have erred  in treating  as you have done  a man who was once                                      your affectionate and kind friend mrs  jewkes has directions concerning you  and if your lot is now harder than you might wish  you will bear it the easier  because your own rash folly has brought it upon you alas  for me  what a fate is mine  to be thus thought artful  and forward  and ungrateful  when all i intended was to preserve my innocence  and when all the poor little shifts  which his superior wicked wit and cunning have rendered ineffectual  were forced upon me in my own necessary defence when mrs  jewkes came up to me again  she found me bathed in tears  she seemed  as i thought  to be moved to some compassion  and finding myself now entirely in her power  and that it is not for me to provoke her i said  it is now  i see  in vain for me to contend against my evil destiny  and the superior arts of my barbarous master  i will resign myself to the divine will  and prepare to expect the worst  but you see how this poor mr  williams is drawn in and undone  i am sorry i am made the cause of his ruin  poor  poor man to be thus involved  and for my sake too but if you ll believe me  said i  i gave no encouragement to what he proposed  as to marriage  nor would he have proposed it  i believe  but as the only honourable way he thought was left to save me and his principal motive to it at all  was virtue and compassion to one in distress  what other view could he have  you know i am poor and friendless  all i beg of you is  to let the poor gentleman have notice of my master s resentment  and let him fly the country  and not be thrown into gaol  this will answer my master s end as well  for it will as effectually hinder him from assisting me  as if he was in a prison ask me  said she  to do any thing that is in my power  consistent with my duty and trust  and i will do it  for i am sorry for you both  but to be sure  i shall keep no correspondence with him  nor let you  i offered to talk of a duty superior to that she mentioned  which would oblige her to help distressed innocence  and not permit her to go the lengths enjoined by lawless tyranny  but she plainly bid me be silent on that head  for it was in vain to attempt to persuade her to betray her trust all i have to advise you  said she  is to be easy  lay aside all your contrivances and arts to get away  and make me your friend by giving me no reason to suspect you  for i glory in my fidelity to my master  and you have both practised some strange sly arts  to make such a progress as he has owned there was between you  so seldom as i thought you saw one another  and i must be more circumspect than i have been this doubled my concern  for i now apprehended i should be much closer watched than before well  said i  since i have  by this strange accident  discovered my hard destiny  let me read over again that fearful letter of yours  that i may get it by heart  and with it feed my distress  and make calamity familiar to me  then  said she  let me read yours again  i gave her mine  and she lent me hers  and so i took a copy of it  with her leave because  as i said i would  by it  prepare myself for the worst  and when i had done  i pinned it on the head of the couch  this  said i  is the use i shall make of this wretched copy of your letter  and here you shall always find it wet with my tears she said she would go down to order supper  and insisted upon my company to it  i would have excused myself  but she began to put on a commanding air  that i durst not oppose  and when i went down  she took me by the hand  and presented me to the most hideous monster i ever saw in my life  here  monsieur colbrand  said she  here is your pretty ward and mine  let us try to make her time with us easy  he bowed  and put on his foreign grimaces  and seemed to bless himself  and  in broken english told me  i was happy in de affections of de finest gentleman in de varld i was quite frightened  and ready to drop down  and i will describe him to you  my dear father and mother  if now you will ever see this  and you shall judge if i had not reason  especially not knowing he was to be there  and being apprised  as i was  of his hated employment to watch me closer he is a giant of a man for stature  taller by a good deal than harry mowlidge  in your neighbourhood  and large boned  and scraggy  and has a hand i never saw such an one in my life  he has great staring eyes like the bull s that frightened me so  vast jaw bones sticking out eyebrows hanging over his eyes  two great scars upon his forehead  and one on his left cheek  and two large whiskers  and a monstrous wide mouth  blubber lips  long yellow teeth  and a hideous grin  he wears his own frightful long hair  tied up in a great black bag  a black crape neckcloth about a long ugly neck  and his throat sticking out like a wen  as to the rest  he was dressed well enough  and had a sword on with a nasty red knot to it  leather garters  buckled below his knees and a foot near as long as my arm  i verily think he said  he fright de lady  and offered to withdraw  but she bid him not  and i told mrs  jewkes  that as she knew i had been crying  she should not have called me to the gentleman without letting me know he was there  i soon went up to my closet  for my heart ached all the time i was at table  not being able to look upon him without horror  and this brute of a woman  though she saw my distress  before this addition to it  no doubt did it on purpose to strike more terror into me  and indeed it had its effect  for when i went to bed  i could think of nothing but his hideous person  and my master s more hideous actions  and thought them too well paired  and when i dropt asleep  i dreamed they were both coming to my bedside  with the worst designs  and i jumped out of my bed in my sleep  and frightened mrs  jewkes  till  waking with the terror  i told her my dream  and the wicked creature only laughed  and said  all i feared was but a dream  as well as that  and when it was over  and i was well awake  i should laugh at it as such and now i am come to the close of wednesday  the th day of my distress poor mr  williams is actually arrested  and carried away to stamford so there is an end of all my hopes from him  poor gentleman  his over security and openness have ruined us both  i was but too well convinced  that we ought not to have lost a moment s time  but he was half angry  and thought me too impatient  and then his fatal confessions  and the detestable artifice of my master but one might well think  that he who had so cunningly  and so wickedly  contrived all his stratagems hitherto  that it was impossible to avoid them  would stick at nothing to complete them  i fear i shall soon find it so but one stratagem i have just invented  though a very discouraging one to think of  because i have neither friends nor money  nor know one step of the way  if i was out of the house  but let bulls  and bears  and lions  and tigers  and  what is worse  false  treacherous  deceitful men  stand in my way  i cannot be in more danger than i am  and i depend nothing upon his three weeks  for how do i know  now he is in such a passion  and has already begun his vengeance on poor mr  williams  that he will not change his mind  and come down to lincolnshire before he goes to london my stratagem is this  i will endeavour to get mrs  jewkes to go to bed without me  as she often does  while i sit locked up in my closet  and as she sleeps very sound in her first sleep  of which she never fails to give notice by snoring  if i can but then get out between the two bars of the window  for you know i am very slender  and i find i can get my head through  then i can drop upon the leads underneath  which are little more than my height  and which leads are over a little summer parlour  that juts out towards the garden  and as i am light  i can easily drop from them  for they are not high from the ground  then i shall be in the garden  and then  as i have the key of the back door i will get out  but i have another piece of cunning still  good heaven succeed to me my dangerous  but innocent devices i have read of a great captain  who  being in danger  leaped overboard into the sea and his enemies  as he swam  shooting at him with bows and arrows  he unloosed his upper garment  and took another course  while they stuck that full of their darts and arrows  and so he escaped  and lived to triumph over them all  so what will i do  but strip off my upper petticoat  and throw it into the pond  with my neckhandkerchief  for to be sure  when they miss me  they will go to the pond first  thinking i have drowned myself  and so  when they see some of my clothes floating there  they will be all employed in dragging the pond  which is a very large one  and as i shall not  perhaps  be missed till the morning  this will give me opportunity to get a great way off  and i am sure i will run for it when i am out  and so i trust  that providence will direct my steps to some good place of safety  and make some worthy body my friend for sure  if i suffer ever so  i cannot be in more danger  nor in worse hands  than where i am  and with such avowed bad designs o my dear parents  don t be frightened when you come to read this but all will be over before you can see it  and so god direct me for the best  my writings  for fear i should not escape  i will bury in the garden  for  to be sure  i shall be searched and used dreadfully if i can t get off  and so i will close here  for the present  to prepare for my plot  prosper thou  o gracious protector of oppressed innocence  this last effort of thy poor handmaid  that i may escape the crafty devices and snares that have begun to entangle my virtue  and from which  but by this one trial  i see no way of escaping  and oh  whatever becomes of me  bless my dear parents  and protect poor mr  williams from ruin  for he was happy before he knew me just now  just now  i heard mrs  jewkes  who is in her cups  own to the horrid colbrand  that the robbing of poor mr  williams was a contrivance of hers  and executed by the groom and a helper  in order to seize my letters upon him  which they missed  they are now both laughing at the dismal story  which they little think i overheard o how my heart aches  for what are not such wretches capable of  can you blame me for endeavouring  through any danger  to get out of such clutches past eleven o clock mrs  jewkes is come up  and gone to bed  and bids me not stay long in my closet  but come to bed  o for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute  i never saw her so tipsy  and that gives me hopes  i have tried again  and find i can get my head through the iron bars  i am now all prepared as soon as i hear her fast  and now i ll seal up these  and my other papers  my last work  and to thy providence  o my gracious god  commit the rest once more  god bless you both  and send us a happy meeting if not here  in his heavenly kingdom  amen thursday  friday  saturday  sunday  the th  th  th  and st days of my distress and distress indeed  for here i am still  and every thing has been worse and worse  oh  the poor unhappy pamela without any hope left  and ruined in all my contrivances  but  oh  my dear parents  rejoice with me  even in this low plunge of my distress  for your poor pamela has escaped from an enemy worse than any she ever met with  an enemy she never thought of before  and was hardly able to stand against  i mean the weakness and presumption  both in one  of her own mind  which had well nigh  had not the divine grace interposed  sunk her into the lowest  last abyss of misery and perdition i will proceed  as i have opportunity  with my sad relation  for my pen and ink in my now doubly secured closet  are all i have to employ myself with  and indeed i have been so weak  that  till yesterday evening  i have not been able to hold a pen i took with me but one shift  besides what i had on  and two handkerchiefs  and two caps  which my pocket held  for it was not for me to encumber myself  and all my stock of money  which was but five or six shillings  to set out for i knew not where  and got out of the window  not without some difficulty  sticking a little at my shoulders and hips  but i was resolved to get out  if possible  and it was farther from the leads than i thought  and i was afraid i had sprained my ancle and when i had dropt from the leads to the ground  it was still farther off  but i did pretty well there  at least  i got no hurt to hinder me from pursuing my intentions  so being now on the ground  i hid my papers under a rose bush  and covered them with mould  and there they still lie  as i hope  then i hied away to the pond  the clock struck twelve just as i got out  and it was a dark misty night  and very cold  but i felt it not then when i came to the pond side  i flung in my upper coat  as i had designed  and my neckhandkerchief  and a round eared cap  with a knot and then with great speed ran to the door  and took the key out of my pocket  my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom  as if it would have forced its way through it  and beat it well might  for i then  too late  found  that i was most miserably disappointed  for the wicked woman had taken off that lock  and put another on  so that my key would not open it  i tried  and tried  and feeling about  i found a padlock besides  on another part of the door  o then how my heart sunk i dropt down with grief and confusion  unable to stir or support myself  for a while  but my fears awakening my resolution  and knowing that my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger i could then encounter  i clambered up upon the ledges of the door  and upon the lock  which was a great wooden one  and reached the top of the door with my hands  then  little thinking i could climb so well  i made shift to lay hold on the top of the wall with my hands  but  alas for me  nothing but ill luck no escape for poor pamela  the wall being old  the bricks i held by gave way  just as i was taking a spring to get up  and down came i  and received such a blow upon my head  with one of the bricks that it quite stunned me  and i broke my shins and my ancle besides  and beat off the heel of one of my shoes in this dreadful way  flat upon the ground  lay poor i  for i believe five or six minutes  and then trying to get up  i sunk down again two or three times  and my left hip and shoulder were very stiff  and full of pain  with bruises  and  besides  my head bled  and ached grievously with the blow i had with the brick  yet these hurts i valued not  but crept a good way upon my feet and hands  in search of a ladder  i just recollected to have seen against the wall two days before  on which the gardener was nailing a nectarine branch that was loosened from the wall  but no ladder could i find  and the wall was very high  what now thought i  must become of the miserable pamela then i began to wish myself most heartily again in my closet  and to repent of my attempt which i now censured as rash  because it did not succeed god forgive me  but a sad thought came just then into my head i tremble to think of it  indeed my apprehensions of the usage i should meet with  had like to have made me miserable for ever  o my dear  dear parents  forgive your poor child  but being then quite desperate  i crept along  till i could raise myself on my staggering feet  and away limped i what to do  but to throw myself into the pond  and so put a period to all my griefs in this world but  o  to find them infinitely aggravated had i not  by the divine grace  been withheld  in a miserable eternity  as i have escaped this temptation  blessed be god for it  i will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion  that the divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance  that i am yet on this side the dreadful gulf  from which there could have been no return it was well for me  as i have since thought  that i was so maimed  as made me the longer before i got to the water  for this gave me time to consider  and abated the impetuousness of my passions  which possibly might otherwise have hurried me  in my first transport of grief  on my seeing no way to escape  and the hard usage i had reason to expect from my dreadful keepers  to throw myself in  but my weakness of body made me move so slowly  that it gave time  as i said  for a little reflection  a ray of grace  to dart in upon my benighted mind  and so when i came to the pond side  i sat myself down on the sloping bank  and began to ponder my wretched condition  and thus i reasoned with myself pause here a little  pamela  on what thou art about  before thou takest the dreadful leap  and consider whether there be no way yet left  no hope  if not to escape from this wicked house  yet from the mischiefs threatened thee in it i then considered  and  after i had cast about in my mind every thing that could make me hope  and saw no probability  a wicked woman  devoid of all compassion  a horrid helper  just arrived  in this dreadful colbrand  an angry and resenting master  who now hated me  and threatened the most afflicting evils  and that i should  in all probability  be deprived even of the opportunity  i now had before me  to free myself from all their persecutions what hast thou to do distressed creature  said i to myself  but throw thyself upon a merciful god  who knows how innocently i suffer  to avoid the merciless wickedness of those who are determined on my ruin and then  thought i  and oh  that thought was surely of the devil s instigation  for it was very soothing  and powerful with me  these wicked wretches  who now have no remorse  no pity on me  will then be moved to lament their misdoings  and when they see the dead corpse of the unhappy pamela dragged out to these dewy banks  and lying breathless at their feet  they will find that remorse to soften their obdurate heart  which  now  has no place there and my master  my angry master will then forget his resentments  and say  o  this is the unhappy pamela  that i have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed  now do i see she preferred her honesty to her life  will he say  and is no hypocrite  nor deceiver  but really was the innocent creature she pretended to be  then  thought i  will he  perhaps  shed a few tears over the poor corpse of his persecuted servant  and though he may give out  it was love and disappointment  and that  perhaps  in order to hide his own guilt  for the unfortunate mr  williams  yet will he be inwardly grieved  and order me a decent funeral  and save me  or rather this part of me  from the dreadful stake  and the highway interment and the young men and maidens all around my dear father s will pity poor pamela  but  o  i hope i shall not be the subject of their ballads and elegies  but that my memory  for the sake of my dear father and mother may quickly slide into oblivion i was once rising  so indulgent was i to this sad way of thinking  to throw myself in  but  again  my bruises made me slow  and i thought what art thou about to do  wretched pamela  how knowest thou  though the prospect be all dark to thy short sighted eye  what god may do for thee even when all human means fail  god almighty would not lay me under these sore afflictions  if he had not given me strength to grapple with them  if i will exert it as i ought  and who knows  but that the very presence i so much dread of my angry and designing master  for he has had me in his power before  and yet i have escaped  may be better for me  than these persecuting emissaries of his  who  for his money  are true to their wicked trust  and are hardened by that  and a long habit of wickedness  against compunction of heart  god can touch his heart in an instant  and if this should not be done  i can then but put an end to my life by some other means  if i am so resolved but how do i know  thought i  that even these bruises and maims that i have gotten  while i pursued only the laudable escape i had meditated may not kindly have furnished me with the opportunity i am now tempted with to precipitate myself  and of surrendering up my life  spotless and unguilty  to that merciful being who gave it then  thought i  who gave thee  presumptuous as thou art  a power over thy life  who authorised thee to put an end to it  when the weakness of thy mind suggests not to thee a way to preserve it with honour  how knowest thou what purposes god may have to serve  by the trials with which thou art now exercised  art thou to put a bound to the divine will  and to say  thus much will i bear  and no more  and wilt thou dare to say  that if the trial be augmented and continued  thou wilt sooner die than bear it this act of despondency  thought i  is a sin  that  if i pursue it admits of no repentance  and can therefore hope no forgiveness and wilt thou  to shorten thy transitory griefs  heavy as they are  and weak as thou fanciest thyself  plunge both body and soul into everlasting misery  hitherto  pamela  thought i  thou art the innocent  the suffering pamela  and wilt thou  to avoid thy sufferings  be the guilty aggressor  and  because wicked men persecute thee  wilt thou fly in the face of the almighty  and distrust his grace and goodness  who can still turn all these sufferings to benefits  and how do i know  but that god who sees all the lurking vileness of my heart  may have permitted these sufferings on that very score  and to make me rely solely on his grace and assistance  who  perhaps  have too much prided myself in a vain dependence on my own foolish contrivances then  again  thought i  wilt thou suffer in one moment all the good lessons of thy poor honest parents  and the benefit of their example who have persisted in doing their duty with resignation to the divine will  amidst the extreme degrees of disappointment  poverty  and distress  and the persecutions of an ungrateful world  and merciless creditors  to be thrown away upon thee  and bring down  as in all probability this thy rashness will  their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave  when they shall understand  that their beloved daughter slighting the tenders of divine grace  despairing of the mercies of a protecting god  has blemished  in this last act  a whole life  which they had hitherto approved and delighted in what then  presumptuous pamela  dost thou here  thought i  quit with speed these perilous banks  and fly from these curling waters  that seem  in their meaning murmurs  this still night  to reproach thy rashness  tempt not god s goodness on the mossy banks  that have been witnesses of thy guilty purpose  and while thou hast power left thee avoid the tempting evil  lest thy grand enemy  now repulsed by divine grace  and due reflection  return to the assault with a force that thy weakness may not be able to resist  and let one rash moment destroy all the convictions  which now have awed thy rebellious mind into duty and resignation to the divine will and so saying  i arose  but was so stiff with my hurts  so cold with the moist dew of the night  and the wet grass on which i had sat  as also with the damps arising from so large a piece of water  that with great pain i got from this pond  which now i think of with terror  and bending my limping steps towards the house  took refuge in the corner of an outhouse  where wood and coals are laid up for family use  till i should be found by my cruel keepers  and consigned to a more wretched confinement  and worse usage than i had hitherto experienced  and there behind a pile of firewood i crept  and lay down  as you may imagine with a mind just broken  and a heart sensible to nothing but the extremest woe and dejection this  my dear father and mother  is the issue of your poor pamela s fruitless enterprise  and who knows  if i had got out at the back door whether i had been at all in a better case  moneyless  friendless  as i am  and in a strange place but blame not your poor daughter too much nay  if ever you see this miserable scribble  all bathed and blotted with my tears  let your pity get the better of your reprehension  but i know it will and i must leave off for the present for  oh my strength and my will are at this time very far unequal to one another but yet i will add  that though i should have praised god for my deliverance  had i been freed from my wicked keepers  and my designing master  yet i have more abundant reason to praise him  that i have been delivered from a worse enemy myself i will conclude my sad relation it seems mrs  jewkes awaked not till day break  and not finding me in bed  she called me  and  no answer being returned  she relates  that she got out of bed  and ran to my closet  and  missing me  searched under the bed  and in another closet  finding the chamber door as she had left it  quite fast  and the key  as usual  about her wrist  for if i could have got out of the chamber door  there were two or three passages and doors to them all  double locked and barred  to go through into the great garden  so that  to escape  there was no way  but out of the window  and of that window  because of the summer parlour under it  for the other windows are a great way from the ground she says she was excessively frightened  and instantly raised the swiss and the two maids  who lay not far off  and finding every door fast  she said  i must be carried away  as st  peter was out of prison  by some angel  it is a wonder she had not a worse thought she says  she wept  and wrung her hands  and took on sadly  running about like a mad woman  little thinking i could have got out of the closet window  between the iron bars  and  indeed  i don t know whether i could do so again  but at last finding that casement open  they concluded it must be so  and ran out into the garden  and found my footsteps in the mould of the bed which i dropt down upon from the leads  and so speeded away all of them  that is to say  mrs  jewkes colbrand  and nan  towards the back door  to see if that was fast  while the cook was sent to the out offices to raise the men  and make them get horses ready  to take each a several way to pursue me but  it seems  finding that door double locked and padlocked  and the heel of my shoe  and the broken bricks  they verily concluded i was got away by some means over the wall  and then  they say  mrs  jewkes seemed like a distracted woman  till  at last  nan had the thought to go towards the pond  and there seeing my coat  and cap  and handkerchief in the water  cast almost to the banks by the agitation of the waves she thought it was me  and  screaming out  ran to mrs  jewkes  and said o  madam  madam  here s a piteous thing mrs  pamela lies drowned in the pond  thither they all ran  and finding my clothes  doubted not i was at the bottom  and they all  swiss among the rest  beat their breasts  and made most dismal lamentations  and mrs  jewkes sent nan to the men  to bid them get the drag net ready  and leave the horses  and come to try to find the poor innocent  as she  it seems  then called me  beating her breast  and lamenting my hard hap  but most what would become of them  and what account they should give to my master while every one was thus differently employed  some weeping and wailing some running here and there  nan came into the wood house  and there lay poor i  so weak  so low  and dejected  and withal so stiff with my bruises  that i could not stir  nor help myself to get upon my feet and i said  with a low voice  for i could hardly speak  mrs  ann  mrs ann the creature was sadly frightened  but was taking up a billet to knock me on the head  believing i was some thief  as she said  but i cried out  o mrs  ann  mrs  ann  help me  for pity s sake  to mrs  jewkes  for i cannot get up bless me  said she  what  you madam why  our hearts are almost broken  and we were going to drag the pond for you  believing you had drowned yourself  now  said she  you ll make us all alive again and  without helping me  she ran away to the pond  and brought all the crew to the wood house the wicked woman  as she entered  said  where is she plague of her spells  and her witchcrafts  she shall dearly repent of this trick  if my name be jewkes  and  coming to me  took hold of my arm so roughly  and gave me such a pull  as made me squeal out my shoulder being bruised on that side  and drew me on my face  o cruel creature  said i  if you knew what i have suffered  it would move you to pity me even colbrand seemed to be concerned  and said  fie  madam  fie  you see she is almost dead  you must not be so rough with her  the coachman robin seemed to be sorry for me too  and said  with sobs  what a scene is here  don t you see she is all bloody in her head  and cannot stir curse of her contrivance  said the horrid creature  she has frightened me out of my wits  i m sure  how the d l came you here oh  said i  ask me now no questions  but let the maids carry me up to my prison  and there let me die decently  and in peace  for indeed  i thought i could not live two hours the still more inhuman tigress said  i suppose you want mr  williams to pray by you  don t you  well  i ll send for my master this minute  let him come and watch you himself  for me  for there s no such thing as holding you  i m sure so the maids took me up between them  and carried me to my chamber  and when the wretch saw how bad i was  she began a little to relent while every one wondered at which i had neither strength nor inclination to tell them  how all this came to pass  which they imputed to sorcery and witchcraft i was so weak  when i had got up stairs  that i fainted away  with dejection  pain  and fatigue  and they undressed me  and got me to bed and mrs  jewkes ordered nan to bathe my shoulder  and arm  and ancle with some old rum warmed  and they cut the hair a little from the back part of my head  and washed that  for it was clotted with blood  from a pretty long  but not a deep gash  and put a family plaister upon it for  if this woman has any good quality  it is  it seems  in a readiness and skill to manage in cases  where sudden misfortunes happen in a family after this  i fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep  and lay till twelve o clock  tolerably easy  considering i was very feverish and aguishly inclined  and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo more trials  which i had hoped would have been happily ended  but providence did not see fit she would make me rise about twelve  but i was so weak  i could only sit up till the bed was made  and went into it again  and was  as they said delirious some part of the afternoon  but having a tolerable night on thursday  i was a good deal better on friday  and on saturday got up and ate a little spoon meat  and my feverishness seemed to be gone  and i was so mended by evening  that i begged her indulgence in my closet to be left to myself  which she consented to  it being double barred the day before  and i assuring her  that all my contrivances  as she called them  were at an end  but first she made me tell the whole story of my enterprise  which i did very faithfully  knowing now that nothing could stand me in any stead  or contribute to my safety and escape  and she seemed full of wonder at my resolution  but told me frankly  that i should have found it a hard matter to get quite off  for that she was provided with a warrant from my master who is a justice of peace in this county as well as in the other  to get me apprehended  if i had got away  on suspicion of wronging him  let me have been where i would o how deep laid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted head surely  surely  i cannot be worthy of all this contrivance  this too well shews me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the other house  that my master swore he would have me  o preserve me heaven  from being his  in his own wicked sense of the adjuration i must add  that now the woman sees me pick up so fast  she uses me worse  and has abridged me of paper  all but one sheet  which i am to shew her  written or unwritten  on demand  and has reduced me to one pen  yet my hidden stores stand me in stead  but she is more and more snappish and cross  and tauntingly calls me mrs  williams  and any thing she thinks will vex me sunday afternoon mrs  jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing  for three or four hours  this afternoon  and i am a good deal better and should be much more so  if i knew for what i am reserved  but health is a blessing hardly to be coveted in my circumstances  since that but exposes me to the calamity i am in continual apprehensions of  whereas a weak and sickly state might possibly move compassion for me  o how i dread the coming of this angry and incensed master  though i am sure i have done him no harm just now we heard  that he had like to have been drowned in crossing the stream  a few days ago  in pursuing his game  what is the matter  that with all his ill usage of me  i cannot hate him  to be sure  i am not like other people  he has certainly done enough to make me hate him  but yet  when i heard his danger  which was very great  i could not in my heart forbear rejoicing for his safety  though his death would have ended my afflictions  ungenerous master  if you knew this  you surely would not be so much my persecutor  but  for my late good lady s sake i must wish him well  and o what an angel would he be in my eyes yet  if he would cease his attempts  and reform well  i hear by mrs  jewkes  that john arnold is turned away  being detected in writing to mr  williams  and that mr  longman  and mr jonathan the butler  have incurred his displeasure  for offering to speak in my behalf  mrs  jervis too is in danger  for all these three probably  went together to beg in my favour  for now it is known where i am mrs  jewkes has  with the news about my master  received a letter but she says the contents are too bad for me to know  they must be bad indeed  if they be worse than what i have already known just now the horrid creature tells me  as a secret  that she has reason to think he has found out a way to satisfy my scruples  it is  by marrying me to this dreadful colbrand  and buying me of him on the wedding day  for a sum of money was ever the like heard she says it will be my duty to obey my husband  and that mr  williams will be forced  as a punishment  to marry us  and that  when my master has paid for me  and i am surrendered up  the swiss is to go home again  with the money  to his former wife and children  for  she says  it is the custom of those people to have a wife in every nation but this  to be sure  is horrid romancing  yet  abominable as it is it may possibly serve to introduce some plot now hatching with what strange perplexities is my poor mind agitated  perchance  some sham marriage may be designed  on purpose to ruin me  but can a husband sell his wife against her own consent and will such a bargain stand good in law monday  tuesday  wednesday  the d  d  and th days of my imprisonment nothing offers these days but squabblings between mrs  jewkes and me she grows worse and worse to me  i vexed her yesterday  because she talked nastily  and told her she talked more like a vile london prostitute  than a gentleman s housekeeper  and she thinks she cannot use me bad enough for it  bless me  she curses and storms at me like a trooper  and can hardly keep her hands off me  you may believe she must talk sadly  to make me say such harsh words  indeed it cannot be repeated  as she is a disgrace to her sex  and then she ridicules me and laughs at my notions of honesty  and tells me  impudent creature as she is  what a fine bed fellow i shall make for my master and such like  with such whimsical notions about me do you think this is to be borne  and yet she talks worse than this  if possible  quite filthily  o what vile hands am i put into thursday i have now all the reason that can be  to apprehend my master will be here soon  for the servants are busy in setting the house to rights  and a stable and coach house are cleaning out  that have not been used some time  i asked mrs  jewkes  but she tells me nothing  nor will hardly answer me when i ask her a question  sometimes i think she puts on these strange wicked airs to me  purposely to make me wish for  what i dread most of all things  my master s coming down  he talk of love if he had any the least notion of regard for me  to be sure he would not give this naughty body such power over me and if he does come  where is his promise of not seeing me without i consent to it  but  it seems  his honour owes me nothing  so he tells me in his letter  and why  because i am willing to keep mine  but  indeed  he says  he hates me perfectly but it is plain he does  or i should not be left to the mercy of this woman  and  what is worse  to my woful apprehensions friday  the th day of my imprisonment i took the liberty yesterday afternoon  finding the gates open  to walk out before the house  and  ere i was aware  had got to the bottom of the long row of elms  and there i sat myself down upon the steps of a sort of broad stile  which leads into the road  and goes towards the town and as i sat musing upon what always busies my mind  i saw a whole body of folks running towards me from the house  men and women  as in a fright  at first i wondered what was the matter  till they came nearer and i found they were all alarmed  thinking i had attempted to get off there was first the horrible colbrand  running with his long legs  well nigh two yards at a stride  then there was one of the grooms  poor mr  williams s robber  then i spied nan  half out of breath  and the cook maid after her  and lastly  came waddling  as fast as she could mrs  jewkes  exclaiming most bitterly  as i found  against me  colbrand said  o how have you frighted us all and went behind me  lest i should run away  as i suppose i sat still  to let them see i had no view to get away  for  besides the improbability of succeeding  my last sad attempt has cured me of enterprising again  and when mrs  jewkes came within hearing  i found her terribly incensed  and raving about my contrivances  why  said i should you be so concerned  here i have sat a few minutes  and had not the least thought of getting away  or going farther  but to return as soon as it was duskish  she would not believe me  and the barbarous creature struck at me with her horrid fist  and  i believe  would have felled me  had not colbrand interposed  and said  he saw me sitting still  looking about me  and not seeming to have the least inclination to stir  but this would not serve  she ordered the two maids to take me each by an arm  and lead me back into the house  and up stairs  and there have i been locked up ever since  without shoes  in vain have i pleaded  that i had no design  as indeed i had not the least  and last night i was forced to be between her and nan  and i find she is resolved to make a handle of this against me  and in her own behalf indeed what with her usage  and my own apprehensions of still worse  i am quite weary of my life just now she has been with me  and given me my shoes  and has laid her imperious commands upon me  to dress myself in a suit of clothes out of the portmanteau  which i have not seen lately  against three or four o clock  for she says  she is to have a visit from lady darnford s two daughters  who come purposely to see me  and so she gave me the key of the portmanteau  but i will not obey her  and i told her  i would not be made a show of  nor see the ladies  she left me  saying  it would be worse for me  if i did not  but how can that be five o clock is come and no young ladies so that i fancy but hold  i hear their coach i believe  i ll step to the window i won t go down to them  i am resolved good sirs  good sirs  what will become of me  here is my master come in his fine chariot indeed he is  what shall i do  where shall i hide myself o  what shall i do  pray for me  but oh  you ll not see this now  good god of heaven  preserve me  if it be thy blessed will seven o clock though i dread to see him  yet do i wonder i have not  to be sure something is resolved against me  and he stays to hear all her stories i can hardly write  yet  as i can do nothing else  i know not how to forbear yet i cannot hold my pen how crooked and trembling the lines i must leave off  till i can get quieter fingers why should the guiltless tremble so  when the guilty can possess their minds in peace saturday morning now let me give you an account of what passed last night  for i had no power to write  nor yet opportunity till now this vile woman held my master till half an hour after seven  and he came hither about five in the afternoon  and then i heard his voice on the stairs  as he was coming up to me  it was about his supper  for he said  i shall choose a boiled chicken with butter and parsley and up he came he put on a stern and majestic air  and he can look very majestic when he pleases  well  perverse pamela  ungrateful runaway  said he  for my first salutation you do well  don t you  to give me all this trouble and vexation  i could not speak  but throwing myself on the floor  hid my face  and was ready to die with grief and apprehension he said well may you hide your face  well may you be ashamed to see me  vile forward one  as you are i sobbed and wept  but could not speak  and he let me lie  and went to the door  and called mrs  jewkes there  said he  take up that fallen angel once i thought her as innocent as an angel of light but i have now no patience with her  the little hypocrite prostrates herself thus  in hopes to move my weakness in her favour  and that i ll raise her from the floor myself  but i shall not touch her no  said he  cruel gentleman as he was  let such fellows as williams be taken in by her artful wiles  i know her now  and see she is for any fool s turn  that will be caught by her i sighed  as if my heart would break and mrs  jewkes lifted me up upon my knees  for i trembled so  i could not stand  come  said she  mrs pamela  learn to know your best friend  confess your unworthy behaviour and beg his honour s forgiveness of all your faults  i was ready to faint  and he said  she is mistress of arts  i ll assure you  and will mimic a fit  ten to one  in a minute i was struck to the heart at this  but could not speak presently  only lifted up my eyes to heaven and at last made shift to say god forgive you  sir he seemed in a great passion  and walked up and down the room  casting sometimes an eye upon me  and seeming as if he would have spoken  but checked himself and at last he said  when she has acted this her first part over  perhaps i will see her again  and she shall soon know what she has to trust to and so he went out of the room  and i was quite sick at heart surely said i  i am the wickedest creature that ever breathed  well  said the impertinent  not so wicked as that neither  but i am glad you begin to see your faults  nothing like being humble come  i ll stand your friend  and plead for you  if you ll promise to be more dutiful for the future  come  come  added the wretch  this may be all made up by to morrow morning  if you are not a fool begone  hideous woman  said i  and let not my affliction be added to by thy inexorable cruelty  and unwomanly wickedness she gave me a push  and went away in a violent passion  and it seems she made a story of this  and said  i had such a spirit  there was no bearing it i laid me down on the floor  and had no power to stir  till the clock struck nine  and then the wicked woman came up again  you must come down stairs  said she  to my master  that is  if you please  spirit said i  i believe i cannot stand  then  said she  i ll send mons  colbrand to carry you down i got up as well as i could  and trembled all the way down stairs and she went before me into the parlour  and a new servant that he had waiting on him  instead of john  withdrew as soon as i came in  and by the way  he had a new coachman too  which looked as if bedfordshire robin was turned away i thought  said he  when i came down  you should have sat at table with me  when i had not company  but when i find you cannot forget your original  but must prefer my menials to me  i call you down to wait on me while i sup  that i may have some talk with you  and throw away as little time as possible upon you sir  said i  you do me honour to wait upon you and i never shall  i hope  forget my original  but i was forced to stand behind his chair that i might hold by it  fill me  said he  a glass of that burgundy i went to do it  but my hand shook so  that i could not hold the plate with the glass in it  and spilt some of the wine  so mrs  jewkes poured it for me  and i carried it as well as i could  and made a low courtesy he took it  and said  stand behind me  out of my sight why  mrs  jewkes  said he  you tell me she remains very sullen still and eats nothing  no  said she  not so much as will keep life and soul together and is always crying  you say  too  yes  sir  answered she  i think she is  for one thing or another  ay  said he  your young wenches will feed upon their tears  and their obstinacy will serve them for meat and drink  i think i never saw her look better though  in my life but i suppose  she lives upon love  this sweet mr  williams  and her little villanous plots together  have kept her alive and well  to be sure  for mischief  love  and contradiction  are the natural aliments of a woman poor i was forced to hear all this  and be silent  and indeed my heart was too full to speak and so you say  said he  that she had another project  but yesterday  to get away  she denies it herself  said she  but it had all the appearance of one  i m sure she made me in a fearful pucker about it  and i am glad your honour is come  with all my heart  and i hope  whatever be your honour s intention concerning her  you will not be long about it  for you ll find her as slippery as an eel  i ll assure you sir  said i  and clasped his knees with my arms  not knowing what i did and falling on my knees  have mercy on me  and hear me  concerning that wicked woman s usage of me he cruelly interrupted me  and said  i am satisfied she has done her duty  it signifies nothing what you say against mrs  jewkes  that you are here  little hypocrite as you are  pleading your cause before me is owing to her care of you  else you had been with the parson wicked girl  said he  to tempt a man to undo himself  as you have done him  at a time i was on the point of making him happy for his life i arose  but said with a deep sigh  i have done  sir i have done i have a strange tribunal to plead before  the poor sheep in the fable had such an one  when it was tried before the vulture  on the accusation of the wolf so  mrs  jewkes  said he  you are the wolf  i the vulture  and this the poor innocent lamb on her trial before us oh  you don t know how well this innocent is read in reflection  she has wit at will  when she has a mind to display her own romantic innocence  at the price of other people s characters well  said the aggravated creature  this is nothing to what she has called me  i have been a jezebel  a london prostitute  and what not but i am contented with her ill names  now i see it is her fashion  and she can call your honour a vulture said i  i had no thought of comparing my master and was going to say on  but he said  don t prate  girl no  said she  it don t become you i am sure well  said i  since i must not speak  i will hold my peace  but there is a righteous judge  who knows the secrets of all hearts  and to him i appeal see there  said he  now this meek  good creature is praying for fire from heaven upon us  o she can curse most heartily  in the spirit of christian meekness  i ll assure you come  saucy face  give me another glass of wine so i did  as well as i could  but wept so  that he said  i suppose i shall have some of your tears in my wine when he had supped  he stood up  and said  o how happy for you it is that you can  at will  thus make your speaking eyes overflow in this manner  without losing any of their brilliancy  you have been told  i suppose  that you are most beautiful in your tears did you ever said he to her  who all this while was standing in one corner of the parlour  see a more charming creature than this  is it to be wondered at  that i demean myself thus to take notice of her see  said he  and took the glass with one hand  and turned me round with the other  what a shape  what a neck  what a hand  and what a bloom on that lovely face but who can describe the tricks and artifices  that lie lurking in her little  plotting  guileful heart  tis no wonder the poor parson was infatuated with her i blame him less than i do her  for who could expect such artifice in so young a sorceress i went to the farther part of the room  and held my face against the wainscot  and in spite of all i could do to refrain crying  sobbed as if my heart would break  he said  i am surprised  mrs  jewkes  at the mistake of the letters you tell me of  but  you see  i am not afraid any body should read what i write  i don t carry on private correspondences and reveal every secret that comes to my knowledge  and then corrupt people to carry my letters against their duty  and all good conscience come hither  hussy  said he  you and i have a dreadful reckoning to make  why don t you come  when i bid you fie upon it  mrs  pamela said she  what  not stir  when his honour commands you to come to him who knows but his goodness will forgive you he came to me  for i had no power to stir  and put his arms about my neck  and would kiss me  and said  well  mrs  jewkes  if it were not for the thought of this cursed parson  i believe in my heart  so great is my weakness  that i could not forgive this intriguing little slut  and take her to my bosom o  said the sycophant  you are very good  sir  very forgiving indeed but come  added the profligate wretch  i hope you will be so good  as to take her to your bosom  and that  by to morrow morning you ll bring her to a better sense of her duty could any thing in womanhood be so vile  i had no patience  but yet grief and indignation choaked up the passage of my words  and i could only stammer out a passionate exclamation to heaven  to protect my innocence  but the word was the subject of their ridicule  was ever poor creature worse beset he said  as if he had been considering whether he could forgive me or not  no  i cannot yet forgive her neither she has given me great disturbance  has brought great discredit upon me  both abroad and at home  has corrupted all my servants at the other house  has despised my honourable views and intentions to her  and sought to run away with this ungrateful parson and surely i ought not to forgive all this yet with all this wretched grimace  he kissed me again  and would have put his hand into my bosom  but i struggled  and said  i would die before i would be used thus consider  pamela  said he  in a threatening tone consider where you are  and don t play the fool  if you do  a more dreadful fate awaits you than you expect  but take her up stairs  mrs jewkes  and i ll send a few lines to her to consider of  and let me have your answer  pamela  in the morning  till then you have to resolve  and after that your doom is fixed so i went up stairs  and gave myself up to grief  and expectation of what he would send  but yet i was glad of this night s reprieve he sent me  however  nothing at all  and about twelve o clock  mrs jewkes and nan came up  as the night before  to be my bed fellows  and i would go to bed with some of my clothes on  which they muttered at sadly  and mrs  jewkes railed at me particularly  indeed i would have sat up all night  for fear  if she would have let me  for i had but very little rest that night  apprehending this woman would let my master in  she did nothing but praise him  and blame me  but i answered her as little as i could he has sir simon tell tale  alias darnford  to dine with him to day whose family sent to welcome him into the country  and it seems the old knight wants to see me  so i suppose i shall be sent for  as samson was to make sport for him here i am  and must bear it all twelve o clock  saturday noon just now he has sent me up  by mrs  jewkes  the following proposals  so here are the honourable intentions all at once laid open  they are  my dear parents  to make me a vile kept mistress  which  i hope  i shall always detest the thoughts of  but you ll see how they are accommodated to what i should have most desired  could i have honestly promoted it your welfare and happiness  i have answered them  as i am sure you ll approve  and i am prepared for the worst  for though i fear there will be nothing omitted to ruin me  and though my poor strength will not be able to defend me  yet i will be innocent of crime in my intention  and in the sight of god  and to him leave the avenging of all my wrongs time and manner  i shall write to you my answer against his articles and hope the best  though i fear the worst  but if i should come home to you ruined and undone  and may not be able to look you in the face  yet pity and inspirit the poor pamela  to make her little remnant of life easy  for long i shall not survive my disgrace  and you may be assured it shall not be my fault  if it be my misfortune to mrs  pamela andrews the following articles are proposed to your serious consideration and let me have an answer  in writing  to them  that i may take my resolutions accordingly  only remember  that i will not be trifled with and what you give for answer will absolutely decide your fate  without expostulation  or farther trouble     this is my answer     forgive  sir  the spirit your poor servant is about to show in     her answer to your articles   not to be warm  and in earnest     on such an occasion as the present  would shew a degree of guilt     that  i hope  my soul abhors   i will not trifle with you  nor     act like a person doubtful of her own mind  for it wants not one     moment s consideration with me  and i therefore return the answer     following  let what will be the consequence i  if you can convince me that the hated parson has had no encouragement from you in his addresses  and that you have no inclination for him in preference to me  then i will offer the following proposals to you  which i will punctually make good     i   as to the first article  sir  it may behove me that i may     not deserve  in your opinion  the opprobrious terms of forward     and artful  and such like  to declare solemnly  that mr  williams     never had the least encouragement from me  as to what you hint     and i believe his principal motive was the apprehended duty of his     function  quite contrary to his apparent interest  to assist a     person he thought in distress   you may  sir  the rather believe     me  when i declare  that i know not the man breathing i would wish     to marry  and that the only one i could honour more than another     is the gentleman  who  of all others  seeks my everlasting dishonour ii  i will directly make you a present of  guineas  for your own use  which you may dispose of to any purpose you please  and will give it absolutely into the hands of any person you shall appoint to receive it  and expect no favour in return  till you are satisfied in the possession of it     ii   as to your second proposal  let the consequence be what it     will  i reject it with all my soul   money  sir  is not my chief     good  may god almighty desert me  whenever it is  and whenever     for the sake of that  i can give up my title to that blessed hope     which will stand me in stead  at a time when millions of gold will     not purchase one happy moment of reflection on a past misspent life iii  i will likewise directly make over to you a purchase i lately made in kent  which brings in l  per annum  clear of all deductions  this shall be made over to you in full property for your life  and for the lives of any children to perpetuity  that you may happen to have  and your father shall be immediately put into possession of it in trust for these purposes  and the management of it will yield a comfortable subsistence to him  and your mother  for life  and i will make up any deficiencies  if such should happen  to that clear sum  and allow him l  per annum  besides  for his life  and that of your mother  for his care and management of this your estate     iii   your third proposal  sir  i reject for the same reason     and am sorry you could think my poor honest parents would enter     into their part of it  and be concerned for the management of     an estate  which would be owing to the prostitution of their     poor daughter   forgive  sir  my warmth on this occasion  but     you know not the poor man  and the poor woman  my ever dear     father and mother  if you think  that they would not much rather     choose to starve in a ditch  or rot in a noisome dungeon  than     accept of the fortune of a monarch  upon such wicked terms     i dare not say all that my full mind suggests to me on this     grievous occasion but  indeed  sir  you know them not  nor     shall the terrors of death  in its most frightful form  i hope     through god s assisting grace  ever make me act unworthy of     such poor honest parents iv  i will  moreover  extend my favour to any other of your relations that you may think worthy of it  or that are valued by you     iv   your fourth proposal  i take upon me  sir  to answer as the     third   if i have any friends that want the favour of the great     may they ever want it  if they are capable of desiring it on     unworthy terms v  i will  besides  order patterns to be sent you for choosing four complete suits of rich clothes  that you may appear with reputation  as if you were my wife  and will give you the two diamond rings  and two pair of ear rings  and diamond necklace  that were bought by my mother to present to miss tomlins  if the match that was proposed between her and me had been brought to effect  and i will confer upon you still other gratuities  as i shall find myself obliged  by your good behaviour and affection     v   fine clothes  sir  become not me  nor have i any ambition     to wear them   i have greater pride in my poverty and meanness     than i should have in dress and finery   believe me  sir  i think     such things less become the humble born pamela  than the rags     your good mother raised me from   your rings  sir  your necklace     and your ear rings  will better befit ladies of degree  than me     and to lose the best jewel  my virtue  would be poorly recompensed     by those you propose to give me   what should i think  when i     looked upon my finger  or saw in the glass those diamonds on my     neck  and in my ears  but that they were the price of my honesty     and that i wore those jewels outwardly  because i had none inwardly vi  now  pamela  will you see by this  what a value i set upon the free will of a person already in my power  and who  if these proposals are not accepted  shall find  that i have not taken all these pains  and risked my reputation  as i have done  without resolving to gratify my passion for you  at all adventures  and if you refuse  without making any terms at all     vi   i know  sir  by woful experience  that i am in your power     i know all the resistance i can make will be poor and weak  and     perhaps  stand me in little stead  i dread your will to ruin me     is as great as your power  yet  sir  will i dare to tell you     that i will make no free will offering of my virtue   all that     i can do  poor as it is  i will do  to convince you  that your     offers shall have no part in my choice  and if i cannot escape     the violence of man  i hope  by god s grace  i shall have nothing     to reproach myself  for not doing all in my power to avoid my     disgrace  and then i can safely appeal to the great god  my only     refuge and protector  with this consolation  that my will bore no     part in my violation vii  you shall be mistress of my person and fortune  as much as if the foolish ceremony had passed  all my servants shall be yours  and you shall choose any two persons to attend yourself  either male or female without any control of mine  and if your conduct be such  that i have reason to be satisfied with it  i know not but will not engage for this  that i may  after a twelvemonth s cohabitation  marry you  for  if my love increases for you  as it has done for many months past  it will be impossible for me to deny you any thing and now  pamela  consider well  it is in your power to oblige me on such terms  as will make yourself  and all your friends  happy  but this will be over this very day  irrevocably over  and you shall find all you would be thought to fear  without the least benefit arising from it to yourself and i beg you ll well weigh the matter  and comply with my proposals and i will instantly set about securing to you the full effect of them and let me  if you value yourself  experience a grateful return on this occasion  and i ll forgive all that s past     vii   i have not once dared to look so high  as to such a     proposal as your seventh article contains   hence have proceeded     all my little abortive artifices to escape from the confinement     you have put me in  although you promised to be honourable to me     your honour  well i know  would not let you stoop to so mean and     so unworthy a slave  as the poor pamela  all i desire is  to be     permitted to return to my native meanness unviolated   what have     i done  sir  to deserve it should be otherwise   for the obtaining     of this  though i would not have married your chaplain  yet would     i have run away with your meanest servant  if i had thought i could     have got safe to my beloved poverty   i heard you once say  sir     that a certain great commander  who could live upon lentils  might     well refuse the bribes of the greatest monarch  and i hope  as i     can contentedly live at the meanest rate  and think not myself     above the lowest condition  that i am also above making an exchange     of my honesty for all the riches of the indies   when i come to be     proud and vain of gaudy apparel  and outside finery  then which i     hope will never be  may i rest my principal good in such vain     trinkets  and despise for them the more solid ornaments of a good     fame  and a chastity inviolate give me leave to say  sir  in answer to what you hint  that you may in a twelvemonth s time marry me  on the continuance of my good behaviour that this weighs less with me  if possible  than any thing else you have said  for  in the first place  there is an end of all merit  and all good behaviour  on my side  if i have now any  the moment i consent to your proposals  and i should be so far from expecting such an honour that i will pronounce  that i should be most unworthy of it  what  sir would the world say  were you to marry your harlot  that a gentleman of your rank in life should stoop  not only to the base born pamela  but to a base born prostitute little  sir  as i know of the world  i am not to be caught by a bait so poorly covered as this yet  after all  dreadful is the thought  that i  a poor  weak friendless  unhappy creature  am too full in your power  but permit me sir  to pray  as i now write on my bended knees  that before you resolve upon my ruin  you will weigh well the matter  hitherto  sir  though you have taken large strides to this crying sin  yet are you on this side the commission of it when once it is done  nothing can recall it  and where will be your triumph what glory will the spoils of such a weak enemy yield you  let me but enjoy my poverty with honesty  is all my prayer  and i will bless you  and pray for you  every moment of my life think  o think  before it is yet too late  what stings  what remorse will attend your dying hour  when you come to reflect  that you have ruined  perhaps soul and body  a wretched creature  whose only pride was her virtue  and how pleased you will be  on the contrary  if in that tremendous moment you shall be able to acquit yourself of this foul crime  and to plead in your own behalf  that you suffered the earnest supplications of an unhappy wretch to prevail with you to be innocent yourself  and let her remain so may god almighty  whose mercy so lately saved you from the peril of perishing in deep waters  on which i hope  you will give me cause to congratulate you  touch your heart in my favour  and save you from this sin  and me from this ruin and to him do i commit my cause  and to him will i give the glory  and night and day pray for you  if i may be permitted to escape this great evil your poor oppressed  broken spirited servant i took a copy of this for your perusal  my dear parents  if i shall ever be so happy to see you again  for i hope my conduct will be approved of by you  and at night  when sir simon was gone  he sent for me down well  said he  have you considered my proposals  yes  sir  said i  i have  and there is my answer  but pray let me not see you read it  is it your bashfulness  said he  or your obstinacy  that makes you not choose i should read it before you i offered to go away  and he said  don t run from me  i won t read it till you are gone  but  said he  tell me  pamela  whether you comply with my proposals  or not  sir  said i  you will see presently  pray don t hold me  for he took my hand  said he  did you well consider before you answered i did  sir  said i  if it be not what you think will please me  said he  dear girl  take it back again  and reconsider it  for if i have this as your absolute answer  and i don t like it  you are undone  for i will not sue meanly  where i can command  i fear  said he  it is not what i like  by your manner  and let me tell you  that i cannot bear denial  if the terms i have offered are not sufficient  i will augment them to two thirds of my estate  for  said he  and swore a dreadful oath  i cannot live without you  and  since the thing is gone so far  i will not  and so he clasped me in his arms in such a manner as quite frightened me  and kissed me two or three times i got from him  and run up stairs  and went to the closet  and was quite uneasy and fearful in an hour s time he called mrs  jewkes down to him  and i heard him very high in passion  and all about me  and i heard her say  it was his own fault  there would be an end of all my complaining and perverseness if he was once resolved  and other most impudent aggravations  i am resolved not to go to bed this night  if i can help it lie still  lie still  my poor fluttering heart what will become of me almost twelve o clock  saturday night he sent mrs  jewkes  about ten o clock  to tell me to come to him where  said i  i ll shew you  said she  i went down three or four steps and saw her making to his chamber  the door of which was open  so i said  i cannot go there don t be foolish  said she  but come  no harm will be done to you well  said i  if i die  i cannot go there  i heard him say  let her come  or it shall be worse for her  i can t bear said he  to speak to her myself well  said i  i cannot come  indeed i cannot  and so i went up again into my closet  expecting to be fetched by force but she came up soon after  and bid me make haste to bed  said i  i will not go to bed this night  that s certain then  said she  you shall be made to come to bed  and nan and i will undress you  i knew neither prayers nor tears would move this wicked woman  so i said  i am sure you will let master in  and i shall be undone  mighty piece of undone  she said  but he was too much exasperated against me  to be so familiar with me  she would assure me ay  said she  you ll be disposed of another way soon  i can tell you for your comfort  and i hope your husband will have your obedience  though nobody else can have it  no husband in the world  said i  shall make me do an unjust or base thing she said  that would be soon tried  and nan coming in  what  said i  am i to have two bed fellows again  these warm nights  yes  said she  slippery one  you are  till you can have one good one instead of us  said i  mrs  jewkes don t talk nastily to me  i see you are beginning again  and i shall affront you  may be  for next to bad actions  are bad words  for they could not be spoken  if they were not in the heart come to bed purity  said she  you are a nonsuch  i suppose  indeed  said i  i can t come to bed  and it will do you no harm to let me stay all night in the great chair  nan  said she  undress my young lady  if she won t let you i ll help you  and  if neither of us can do it quietly  we ll call my master to do it for us  though  said she  i think it an office worthier of monsieur colbrand you are very wicked  said i  i know it  said she i am a jezebel  and a london prostitute  you know  you did great feats said i  to tell my master all this poor stuff  but you did not tell him how you beat me  no  lambkin  said she  a word i had not heard a good while  that i left for you to tell and you was going to do it if the vulture had not taken the wolf s part  and bid the poor innocent lamb be silent ay  said i  no matter for your fleers  mrs  jewkes  though i can have neither justice nor mercy here  and cannot be heard in my defence  yet a time will come  may be  when i shall be heard  and when your own guilt will strike you dumb ay  spirit  said she  and the vulture too  must we both be dumb  why that  lambkin  will be pretty then  said the wicked one  you ll have all the talk to yourself then how will the tongue of the pretty lambkin bleat out innocence  and virtue  and honesty  till the whole trial be at an end you re a wicked woman  that s certain  said i  and if you thought any thing of another world  could not talk thus  but no wonder it shews what hands i m got into ay  so it does  said she  but i beg you ll undress  and come to bed  or i believe your innocence won t keep you from still worse hands  i will come to bed  said i  if you will let me have the keys in my own hand  not else  if i can help it  yes  said she  and then  hey for another contrivance  another escape no  no said i  all my contrivances are over  i ll assure you  pray let me have the keys  and i will come to bed  she came to me  and took me in her huge arms  as if i was a feather  said she  i do this to shew you what a poor resistance you can make against me  if i please to exert myself and so  lambkin  don t say to your wolf  i won t come to bed and set me down  and tapped me on the neck  ah  said she  thou art a pretty creature  tis true  but so obstinate  so full of spirit  if thy strength was but answerable to that  thou would st run away with us all and this great house too on thy back but  undress  undress  i tell you well  said i  i see my misfortunes make you very merry  and very witty too  but i will love you  if you will humour me with the keys of the chamber doors are you sure you will love me  said she  now speak your conscience why  said i  you must not put it so close  neither would you  if you thought you had not given reason to doubt it but i will love you as well as i can i would not tell a wilful lie  and if i did you would not believe me  after your hard usage of me  well  said she that s all fair  i own but nan  pray pull off my young lady s shoes and stockings no  pray don t  said i  i will come to bed presently since i must and so i went to the closet  and scribbled a little about this idle chit chat  and she being importunate  i was forced to go to bed  but with some of my clothes on  as the former night  and she let me hold the two keys  for there are two locks  there being a double door  and so i got a little sleep that night  having had none for two or three nights before i can t imagine what she means  but nan offered to talk a little once or twice  and she snubbed her  and said  i charge you  wench  don t open your lips before me  and if you are asked any questions by mrs  pamela don t answer her one word  while i am here but she is a lordly woman to the maid servants  and that has always been her character  o how unlike good mrs  jervis in every thing sunday morning a thought came into my head  i meant no harm  but it was a little bold for  seeing my master dressing to go to church  and his chariot getting ready  i went to my closet  and i writ     the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired for a     gentleman of great worth and honour  who labours under a temptation     to exert his great power to ruin a poor  distressed  worthless     maiden     and also     the prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired by a poor     distressed creature  for the preservation of her virtue and     innocence mrs  jewkes came up  always writing  said she  and would see it  and strait  all that ever i could say  carried it down to my master he looked upon it  and said  tell her  she shall soon see how her prayers are answered  she is very bold  but as she has rejected all my favours her reckoning for all is not far off  i looked after him out of the window  and he was charmingly dressed  to be sure he is a handsome fine gentleman what pity his heart is not as good as his appearance  why can t i hate him but don t be uneasy  if you should see this  for it is impossible i should love him  for his vices all ugly him over  as i may say my master sends word  that he shall not come home to dinner  i suppose he dines with this sir simon darnford  i am much concerned for poor mr williams  mrs  jewkes says  he is confined still  and takes on much  all his trouble is brought upon him for my sake  this grieves me much  my master  it seems  will have his money from him  this is very hard  for it is three fifty pounds  he gave him  as he thought  as a salary for three years that he has been with him  but there was no agreement between them  and he absolutely depended on my master s favour  to be sure  it was the more generous of him to run these risks for the sake of oppressed innocence  and i hope he will meet with his reward in due time  alas for me  i dare not plead for him  that would raise my oppressor s jealousy more  and i have not interest to save myself sunday evening mrs  jewkes has received a line from my master  i wonder what it is  for his chariot is come home without him  but she will tell me nothing  so it is in vain to ask her  i am so fearful of plots and tricks  i know not what to do every thing i suspect  for  now my disgrace is avowed what can i think to be sure  the worst will be attempted  i can only pour out my soul in prayer to god  for his blessed protection  but  if i must suffer  let me not be long a mournful survivor only let me not shorten my own time sinfully this woman left upon the table  in the chamber  this letter of my master s to her  and i bolted myself in  till i had transcribed it you ll see how tremblingly  by the lines  i wish poor mr  williams s release at any rate  but this letter makes my heart ache  yet i have another day s reprieve  thank god mrs  jewkes i have been so pressed on williams s affair  that i shall set out this afternoon  in sir simon s chariot  and with parson peters  who is his intercessor  for stamford  and shall not be back till to morrow evening if then  as to your ward  i am thoroughly incensed against her  she has withstood her time  and now  would she sign and seal to my articles  it is too late  i shall discover something  perhaps  by him  and will  on my return  let her know  that all her ensnaring loveliness shall not save her from the fate that awaits her  but let her know nothing of this  lest it put her fruitful mind upon plots and artifices  be sure trust her not without another with you at night  lest she venture the window in her foolish rashness  for i shall require her at your hands                                                         yours  etc i had but just finished taking a copy of this  and laid the letter where i had it  and unbolted the door  when she came up in a great fright  for fear i should have seen it  but i being in my closet  and that lying as she left it  she did not mistrust  o  said she  i was afraid you had seen my master s letter here  which i carelessly left on the table i wish  said i  i had known that  why sure  said she  if you had  you would not have offered to read my letters  indeed  said i  i should  at this time  if it had been in my way do let me see it well  said she i wish poor mr  williams well off  i understand my master is gone to make up matters with him  which is very good  to be sure  added she  he is a very good gentleman  and very forgiving why  said i  as if i had known nothing of the matter  how can he make up matters with him  is not mr  williams at stamford  yes  said she  i believe so  but parson peters pleads for him  and he is gone with him to stamford  and will not be back to night  so we have nothing to do  but to eat our suppers betimes and go to bed  ay  that s pure  said i  and i shall have good rest this night  i hope  so  said she  you might every night  but for your own idle fears  you are afraid of your friends  when none are near you  ay that s true  said i  for i have not one near me so i have one more good honest night before me  what the next may be i know not  and so i ll try to take in a good deal of sleep  while i can be a little easy  therefore  here i say  good night  my dear parents for i have no more to write about this night  and though his letter shocks me  yet i will be as brisk as i can  that she mayn t suspect i have seen it tuesday night for the future  i will always mistrust most when appearances look fairest  o your poor daughter  what has she not suffered since what i wrote on sunday night my worst trial  and my fearfullest danger  o how i shudder to write you an account of this wicked interval of time  for my dear parents  will you not be too much frightened and affected with my distress  when i tell you  that his journey to stamford was all abominable pretence  for he came home privately  and had well nigh effected all his vile purposes  and the ruin of your poor daughter  and that by such a plot as i was not in the least apprehensive of  and oh  you ll hear what a vile and unwomanly part that wicked wretch  mrs jewkes  acted in it i left off with letting you know how much i was pleased that i had one night s reprieve added to my honesty  but i had less occasion to rejoice than ever  as you will judge by what i have said already  take  then the dreadful story  as well as i can relate it the maid nan is a little apt to drink  if she can get at liquor  and mrs  jewkes happened  or designed  as is too probable  to leave a bottle of cherry brandy in her way  and the wench drank some of it more than she should  and when she came in to lay the cloth  mrs  jewkes perceived it  and fell a rating at her most sadly  for she has too many faults of her own  to suffer any of the like sort in any body else  if she can help it  and she bid her get out of her sight  when we had supped  and go to bed  to sleep off her liquor  before we came to bed  and so the poor maid went muttering up stairs about two hours after  which was near eleven o clock  mrs  jewkes and i went up to go to bed  i pleasing myself with what a charming night i should have  we locked both doors  and saw poor nan  as i thought  but oh  twas my abominable master  as you shall hear by and by  sitting fast asleep  in an elbow chair  in a dark corner of the room  with her apron thrown over her head and neck  and mrs  jewkes said  there is that beast of a wench fast asleep  instead of being a bed  i knew  said she she had taken a fine dose  i ll wake her  said i  no  don t  said she let her sleep on  we shall he better without her  ay  said i  so we shall  but won t she get cold said she  i hope you have no writing to night  no  replied i  i will go to bed with you  mrs  jewkes  said she  i wonder what you can find to write about so much  and am sure you have better conveniences of that kind  and more paper than i am aware of  and i had intended to rummage you  if my master had not come down  for i spied a broken tea cup with ink  which gave me suspicion  but as he is come  let him look after you if he will  and if you deceive him  it will be his own fault all this time we were undressing ourselves  and i fetched a deep sigh what do you sigh for  said she  i am thinking  mrs  jewkes  answered i  what a sad life i live  and how hard is my lot  i am sure  the thief that has robbed is much better off than i  bating the guilt  and i should  i think  take it for a mercy  to be hanged out of the way rather than live in these cruel apprehensions  so  being not sleepy  and in a prattling vein  i began to give a little history of myself  as i did  once before  to mrs  jervis  in this manner here  said i  were my poor honest parents  they took care to instill good principles into my mind  till i was almost twelve years of age and taught me to prefer goodness and poverty to the highest condition of life  and they confirmed their lessons by their own practice  for they were  of late years  remarkably poor  and always as remarkably honest even to a proverb  for  as honest as goodman andrews  was a byeword well then  said i  comes my late dear good lady  and takes a fancy to me  and said  she would be the making of me  if i was a good girl  and she put me to sing  to dance  to play on the spinnet  in order to divert her melancholy hours  and also taught me all manner of fine needle work but still this was her lesson  my good pamela  be virtuous  and keep the men at a distance  well  so i was  i hope  and so i did  and yet  though i say it  they all loved me and respected me  and would do any thing for me  as if i was a gentlewoman but  then  what comes next why  it pleased god to take my good lady and then comes my master  and what says he why  in effect  it is  be not virtuous  pamela so here i have lived about sixteen years in virtue and reputation  and all at once  when i come to know what is good  and what is evil  i must renounce all the good  all the whole sixteen years  innocence  which next to god s grace  i owed chiefly to my parents  and my lady s good lessons and examples  and choose the evil  and so  in a moment s time become the vilest of creatures  and all this  for what  i pray  why truly  for a pair of diamond ear rings  a necklace  and a diamond ring for my finger  which would not become me  for a few paltry fine clothes  which  when i wore them  would make but my former poverty more ridiculous to every body that saw me  especially when they knew the base terms i wore them upon  but  indeed  i was to have a great parcel of guineas beside  i forget how many  for  had there been ten times more they would have been not so much to me  as the honest six guineas you tricked me out of  mrs  jewkes well  forsooth  but then i was to have i know not how many pounds a year for my life  and my poor father there was the jest of it  was to be the manager for the abandoned prostitute his daughter  and then  there was the jest again  my kind  forgiving  virtuous master  would pardon me all my misdeeds yes  thank him for nothing  truly  and what  pray  are all these violent misdeeds why  they are for daring to adhere to the good lessons that were taught me  and not learning a new one  that would have reversed all my former  for not being contented when i was run away with  in order to be ruined  but contriving  if my poor wits had been able  to get out of danger  and preserve myself honest then was he once jealous of poor john  though he knew john was his own creature  and helped to deceive me then was he outrageous against poor parson williams  and him has this good  merciful master  thrown into gaol  and for what  why  truly  for that  being a divine  and a good man  he had the fear of god before his eyes  and was willing to forego all his expectations of interest  and assist an oppressed poor creature but  to be sure  i must be forward  bold  saucy  and what not  to dare to run away from certain ruin  and to strive to escape from an unjust confinement  and i must be married to the parson  nothing so sure he would have had but a poor catch of me  had i consented  but he  and you too  know i did not want to marry any body  i only wanted to go to my poor parents  and to have my own liberty  and not to be confined by such an unlawful restraint  and which would not have been inflicted upon me  but only that i am a poor  destitute  young body  and have no friend that is able to right me so  mrs  jewkes  said i  here is my history in brief  and i am a very unhappy young creature  to be sure and why am i so why  because my master sees something in my person that takes his present fancy  and because i would not be undone why  therefore to choose  i must  and i shall be undone and this is all the reason that can be given she heard me run on all this time  while i was undressing  without any interruption  and i said  well  i must go to the two closets  ever since an affair of the closet at the other house  though he is so far off  and i have a good mind to wake this poor maid  no  don t  said she  i charge you  i am very angry with her  and she ll get no harm there  and if she wakes  she may come to bed well enough  as long as there is a candle in the chimney so i looked into the closet  and kneeled down in my own  as i used to do  to say my prayers  and this with my underclothes in my hand  all undressed  and passed by the poor sleeping wench  as i thought  in my return  but  oh  little did i think it was my wicked  wicked master  in a gown and petticoat of hers  and her apron over his face and shoulders what meanness will not lucifer make his votaries stoop to  to gain their abominable ends mrs  jewkes  by this time  was got to bed  on the farther side  as she used to be  and  to make room for the maid  when she should awake  i got into bed  and lay close to her  and i said  where are the keys  though said i  i am not so much afraid to night  here  said the wicked woman put your arm under mine  and you shall find them about my wrist  as they used to be  so i did  and the abominable designer held my hand with her right hand  as my right arm was under her left in less than a quarter of an hour  i said  there s poor nan awake  i hear her stir  let us go to sleep  said she  and not mind her  she ll come to bed  when she s quite awake  poor soul  said i  i ll warrant she will have the head ache finely to morrow for this  be silent  said she  and go to sleep  you keep me awake  and i never found you in so talkative a humour in my life  don t chide me  said i  i will but say one thing more  do you think nan could hear me talk of my master s offers  no  no  said she  she was dead asleep  i m glad of that  said i because i would not expose my master to his common servants  and i knew you were no stranger to his fine articles  said she  i think they were fine articles  and you were bewitched you did not close with them  but let us go to sleep  so i was silent  and the pretended nan o wicked base  villanous designer  what a plot  what an unexpected plot was this  seemed to be awaking  and mrs  jewkes  abhorrent creature  said come  nan what  are you awake at last pr ythee come to bed  for mrs pamela is in a talking fit  and won t go to sleep one while at that  the pretended she came to the bed side  and  sitting down in a chair  where the curtain hid her  began to undress  said i  poor mrs anne  i warrant your head aches most sadly  how do you do she answered not a word  said the superlatively wicked woman  you know i have ordered her not to answer you  and this plot  to be sure  was laid when she gave her these orders the night before i heard her  as i thought  breathe all quick and short  indeed  said i mrs  jewkes  the poor maid is not well  what ails you  mrs  anne  and still no answer was made but  i tremble to relate it  the pretended she came into bed  but trembled like an aspen leaf  and i  poor fool that i was  pitied her much but well might the barbarous deceiver tremble at his vile dissimulation  and base designs what words shall i find  my dear mother for my father should not see this shocking part  to describe the rest  and my confusion  when the guilty wretch took my left arm  and laid it under his neck  and the vile procuress held my right  and then he clasped me round the waist said i  is the wench mad  why  how now  confidence  thinking still it had been nan  but he kissed me with frightful vehemence  and then his voice broke upon me like a clap of thunder  now  pamela  said he  is the dreadful time of reckoning come  that i have threatened i screamed out in such a manner  as never anybody heard the like  but there was nobody to help me  and both my hands were secured  as i said  sure never poor soul was in such agonies as i  wicked man  said i  wicked abominable woman  o god  my god  this time  this one time  deliver me from this distress  or strike me dead this moment  and then i screamed again and again says he  one word with you  pamela  one word hear me but  i must say one word to you  it is this  you see now you are in my power you cannot get from me  nor help yourself  yet have i not offered any thing amiss to you  but if you resolve not to comply with my proposals  i will not lose this opportunity  if you do  i will yet leave you o sir  said i  leave me  leave me but  and i will do any thing i ought to do swear then to me  said he  that you will accept my proposals with struggling  fright  terror  i fainted away quite  and did not come to myself soon  so that they both  from the cold sweats that i was in thought me dying and i remember no more  than that  when with great difficulty they brought me to myself  she was sitting on one side of the bed  with her clothes on  and he on the other with his  and in his gown and slippers your poor pamela cannot answer for the liberties taken with her in her deplorable state of death  and when i saw them there  i sat up in my bed  without any regard to what appearance i made  and nothing about my neck  and he soothing me  with an aspect of pity and concern  i put my hand to his mouth  and said  o tell me  yet tell me not  what have i suffered in this distress  and i talked quite wild  and knew not what for  to be sure  i was on the point of distraction he most solemnly  and with a bitter imprecation  vowed  that he had not offered the least indecency  that he was frightened at the terrible manner i was taken with the fit  that he should desist from his attempt and begged but to see me easy and quiet  and he would leave me directly and go to his own bed  o then  said i  take with you this most wicked woman  this vile mrs  jewkes  as an earnest  that i may believe you and will you  sir  said the wicked wretch  for a fit or two  give up such an opportunity as this i thought you had known the sex better she is now  you see  quite well again this i heard  more she might say  but i fainted away once more  at these words  and at his clasping his arms about me again  and  when i came a little to myself  i saw him sit there  and the maid nan  holding a smelling bottle to my nose  and no mrs  jewkes he said  taking my hand  now will i vow to you  my dear pamela  that i will leave you the moment i see you better  and pacified  here s nan knows  and will tell you  my concern for you  i vow to god  i have not offered any indecency to you  and  since i found mrs  jewkes so offensive to you  i have sent her to the maid s bed  and the maid shall be with you to night  and but promise me  that you will compose yourself  and i will leave you  but  said i  will not nan also hold my hand  and will not she let you come in again to me he said  by heaven i will not come in again to night  nan  undress yourself  go to bed  and do all you can to comfort the dear creature  and now  pamela  said he give me but your hand  and say you forgive me  and i will leave you to your repose  i held out my trembling hand  which he vouchsafed to kiss and i said  god forgive you  sir  as you have been just in my distress and as you will be just to what you promise  and he withdrew  with a countenance of remorse  as i hoped  and she shut the doors  and  at my request  brought the keys to bed this  o my dear parents  was a most dreadful trial  i tremble still to think of it  and dare not recall all the horrid circumstances of it  i hope  as he assures me  he was not guilty of indecency  but have reason to bless god  who  by disabling me in my faculties  empowered me to preserve my innocence  and  when all my strength would have signified nothing  magnified himself in my weakness i was so weak all day on monday  that i could not get out of my bed  my master shewed great tenderness for me  and i hope he is really sorry and that this will be his last attempt  but he does not say so neither he came in the morning  as soon as he heard the door open and i began to be fearful  he stopped short of the bed  and said  rather than give you apprehensions  i will come no farther  i said  your honour  sir  and your mercy  is all i have to beg  he sat himself on the side of the bed and asked kindly  how i did begged me to be composed  said  i still looked a little wildly  and i said  pray  good sir  let me not see this infamous mrs  jewkes  i doubt i cannot bear her sight  she shan t come near you all this day  if you ll promise to compose yourself  then sir  i will try  he pressed my hand very tenderly  and went out  what a change does this shew o may it be lasting but  alas  he seems only to have altered his method of proceeding  and retains  i doubt  his wicked purpose on tuesday  about ten o clock  when my master heard i was up  he sent for me down into the parlour  as soon as he saw me  he said  come nearer to me  pamela  i did so  and he took my hand  and said  you begin to look well again  i am glad of it  you little slut  how did you frighten me on sunday night sir  said i  pray name not that night  and my eyes overflowed at the remembrance  and i turned my head aside said he  place some little confidence in me  i know what those charming eyes mean  and you shall not need to explain yourself  for i do assure you  that as soon as i saw you change  and a cold sweat bedew your pretty face  and you fainted away  i quitted the bed  and mrs  jewkes did so too  and i put on my gown  and she fetched her smelling bottle and we both did all we could to restore you  and my passion for you was all swallowed up in the concern i had for your recovery  for i thought i never saw a fit so strong and violent in my life  and feared we should not bring you to life again  for what i saw you in once before was nothing to it  this  said he  might be my folly  and my unacquaintedness with what passion your sex can shew when they are in earnest  but this i repeat to you  that your mind may be entirely comforted whatever i offered to you  was before you fainted away  and that  i am sure  was innocent sir  said i  that was very bad  and it was too plain you had the worst designs  when  said he  i tell you the truth in one instance  you may believe me in the other  i know not  i declare  beyond this lovely bosom  your sex  but that i did intend what you call the worst is most certain  and though i would not too much alarm you now  i could curse my weakness  and my folly  which makes me own  that i love you beyond all your sex  and cannot live without you  but if i am master of myself  and my own resolution  i will not attempt to force you to any thing again sir  said i  you may easily keep your resolution  if you ll send me out of your way  to my poor parents  that is all i beg tis a folly to talk of it  said he  you must not  shall not go  and if i could be assured you would not attempt it  you should have better usage  and your confinement should be made easier to you but to what end  sir  am i to stay  said i  you yourself seem not sure you can keep your own present good resolutions  and do you think  if i was to stay  when i could get away  and be safe  it would not look as if either i confided too much in my own strength  or would tempt my ruin  and as if i was not in earnest to wish myself safe  and out of danger and then  how long am i to stay  and to what purpose  and in what light must i appear to the world  would not that censure me although i might be innocent  and you will allow  sir  that  if there be any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name  or fair reputation  one must not despise the world s censure  if one can avoid it well  said he  i sent not for you on this account  just now  but for two reasons  the first is  that you promise me  that for a fortnight to come you will not offer to go away without my express consent  and this i expect for your own sake  that i may give you a little more liberty  and the second is  that you will see and forgive mrs  jewkes  she takes on much  and thinks that  as all her fault was her obedience to me it would be very hard to sacrifice her  as she calls it  to your resentment as to the first  sir  said i  it is a hard injunction  for the reasons i have mentioned  and as to the second  considering her vile  unwomanly wickedness  and her endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me  when your returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me  it is still harder  but  to shew my obedience to your commands  for you know my dear parents  i might as well make a merit of my compliance  when my refusal would stand me in no stead  i will consent to both  and to every thing else  that you shall be pleased to enjoin  which i can do with innocence that s my good girl  said he  and kissed me  this is quite prudent  and shews me  that you don t take insolent advantage of my favour for you and will  perhaps  stand you in more stead than you are aware of so he rung the bell  and said  call down mrs  jewkes  she came down and he took my hand  and put it into hers  and said  mrs  jewkes  i am obliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me  but pamela  i must own  is not  because the service i employed you in was not so very obliging to her  as i could have wished she would have thought it  and you were not to favour her  but obey me  but yet i ll assure you  at the very first word  she has once obliged me  by consenting to be friends with you  and if she gives me no great cause  i shall not  perhaps  put you on such disagreeable service again now  therefore  be you once more bed fellows and board fellows  as i may say  for some days longer and see that pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house  nor keeps a correspondence unknown to me  especially with that williams and  as for the rest  shew the dear girl all the respect that is due to one i must love  if she will deserve it  as i hope she will yet  and let her be under no unnecessary or harsh restraints  but your watchful care is not  however  to cease  and remember that you are not to disoblige me  to oblige her  and that i will not  cannot  yet part with her mrs  jewkes looked very sullen  and as if she would be glad still to do me a good turn  if it lay in her power i took courage then to drop a word or two for poor mr  williams  but he was angry with me for it  and said he could not endure to hear his name in my mouth  so i was forced to have done for that time all this time  my papers  that i buried under the rose bush  lay there still  and i begged for leave to send a letter to you  so i should  he said  if he might read it first  but this did not answer my design  and yet i would have sent you such a letter as he might see  if i had been sure my danger was over  but that i cannot  for he now seems to take another method  and what i am more afraid of  because  may be  he may watch an opportunity  and join force with it  on occasion  when i am least prepared  for now he seems to abound with kindness  and talks of love without reserve  and makes nothing of allowing himself in the liberty of kissing me  which he calls innocent  but which i do not like and especially in the manner he does it  but for a master to do it at all to a servant  has meaning too much in it  not to alarm an honest body wednesday morning i find i am watched and suspected still very close  and i wish i was with you  but that must not be  it seems  this fortnight  i don t like this fortnight  and it will be a tedious and a dangerous one to me  i doubt my master just now sent for me down to take a walk with him in the garden  but i like him not at all  nor his ways  for he would have  all the way  his arm about my waist  and said abundance of fond things to me  enough to make me proud  if his design had not been apparent  after walking about  he led me into a little alcove  on the farther part of the garden  and really made me afraid of myself  for he began to be very teasing  and made me sit on his knee  and was so often kissing me  that i said  sir  i don t like to be here at all  i assure you  indeed you make me afraid and what made me the more so  was what he once said to mrs  jewkes  and did not think i heard him  and which  though always uppermost with me  i did not mention before  because i did not know how to bring it in  in my writing she  i suppose  had been encouraging him in his wickedness  for it was before the last dreadful trial  and i only heard what he answered said he  i will try once more  but i have begun wrong for i see terror does but add to her frost  but she is a charming girl  and may be thawed by kindness  and i should have melted her by love  instead of freezing her by fear is he not a wicked  sad man for this to be sure  i blush while i write it  but i trust  that that god  who has delivered me from the paw of the lion and the bear  that is  his and mrs  jewkes s violences  will soon deliver me from this philistine  that i may not defy the commands of the living god but  as i was saying  this expression coming into my thoughts  i was of opinion  i could not be too much on my guard  at all times  more especially when he took such liberties  for he professed honour all the time with his mouth  while his actions did not correspond  i begged and prayed he would let me go  and had i not appeared quite regardless of all he said  and resolved not to stay  if i could help it  i know not how far he would have proceeded  for i was forced to fall down upon my knees at last he walked out with me  still bragging of his honour and his love  yes  yes  sir  said i  your honour is to destroy mine  and your love is to ruin me  i see it too plainly  but  indeed  i will not talk with you  sir  said i  any more  do you know  said he  whom you talk to and where you are you may believe i had reason to think him not so decent as he should be for i said  as to where i am  sir  i know it too well  and that i have no creature to befriend me  and  as to whom i talk to  sir  let me ask you  what you would have me answer why  tell me  said he  what answer you would make  it will only make you angry  said i  and so i shall fare worse  if possible  i won t be angry said he  why  then  sir  said i  you cannot be my late good lady s son for she loved me  and taught me virtue  you cannot then be my master for no master demeans himself so to his poor servant he put his arm round me  and his other hand on my neck  which made me more angry and bold  and he said  what then am i  why  said i struggling from him  and in a great passion  to be sure you are lucifer himself  in the shape of my master  or you could not use me thus  these are too great liberties  said he  in anger  and i desire that you will not repeat them  for your own sake  for if you have no decency towards me  i ll have none towards you i was running from him  and he said  come back  when i bid you so knowing every place was alike dangerous to me  and i had nobody to run to  i came back  at his call  and seeing him look displeased  i held my hands together  and wept  and said  pray  sir  forgive me  no  said he rather say  pray  lucifer  forgive me  and  now  since you take me for the devil  how can you expect any good from me how  rather  can you expect any thing but the worst treatment from me you have given me a character  pamela  and blame me not that i act up to it  sir  said i let me beg you to forgive me  i am really sorry for my boldness  but indeed you don t use me like a gentleman  and how can i express my resentment  if i mince the matter  while you are so indecent  precise fool  said he  what indecencies have i offered you i was bewitched i had not gone through my purpose last sunday night  and then your licentious tongue had not given the worst name to little puny freedoms that shew my love and my folly at the same time  but  begone  said he taking my hand  and tossing it from him  and learn another conduct and more wit  and i will lay aside my foolish regard for you  and assert myself  begone  said he  again  with a haughty air indeed  sir  said i  i cannot go  till you pardon me  which i beg on my bended knees  i am truly sorry for my boldness but i see how you go on  you creep by little and little upon me  and now soothe me  and now threaten me  and if i should forbear to shew my resentment  when you offer incivilities to me  would not that be to be lost by degrees  would it not shew  that i could bear any thing from you  if i did not express all the indignation i could express  at the first approaches you make to what i dread  and have you not as good as avowed my ruin and have you once made me hope you will quit your purposes against me  how then  sir can i act  but by shewing my abhorrence of every step that makes towards my undoing  and what is left me but words and can these words be other than such strong ones  as shall shew the detestation which  from the bottom of my heart  i have for every attempt upon my virtue  judge for me  sir  and pardon me pardon you  said he  what  when you don t repent when you have the boldness to justify yourself in your fault  why don t you say  you never will again offend me  i will endeavour  sir  said i  always to preserve that decency towards you which becomes me  but really  sir  i must beg your excuse for saying  that when you forget what belongs to decency in your actions  and when words are all that are left me  to shew my resentment of such actions  i will not promise to forbear the strongest expressions that my distressed mind shall suggest to me  nor shall your angriest frowns deter me  when my honesty is in question what  then  said he  do you beg pardon for  where is the promise of amendment  for which i should forgive you  indeed  sir  said i  i own that must absolutely depend on your usage of me  for i will bear any thing you can inflict upon me with patience  even to the laying down of my life  to shew my obedience to you in other cases  but i cannot be patient  i cannot be passive  when my virtue is at stake  it would be criminal in me  if i was he said  he never saw such a fool in his life  and he walked by the side of me some yards  without saying a word  and seemed vexed  and at last walked in  bidding me attend him in the garden  after dinner  so having a little time  i went up  and wrote thus far wednesday night if  my dear parents  i am not destined more surely than ever for ruin i have now more comfort before me than ever i yet knew  and am either nearer my happiness  or my misery  than ever i was  god protect me from the latter  if it be his blessed will  i have now such a scene to open to you  that  i know  will alarm both your hopes and your fears  as it does mine  and this it is after my master had dined  he took a turn into the stables  to look at his stud of horses  and  when he came in  he opened the parlour door where mrs  jewkes and i sat at dinner  and  at his entrance  we both rose up  but he said  sit still  sit still  and let me see how you eat your victuals  pamela  o  said mrs  jewkes  very poorly  indeed  sir no  said i  pretty well  sir  considering  none of your considerings said he  pretty face  and tapped me on the cheek  i blushed  but was glad he was so good humoured  but i could not tell how to sit before him  nor to behave myself  so he said  i know  pamela  you are a nice carver  my mother used to say so  my lady  sir  said i  was very good to me in every thing  and would always make me do the honours of her table for her  when she was with her few select friends that she loved  cut up  said he  that chicken  i did so  now  said he  and took a knife and fork  and put a wing upon my plate  let me see you eat that  o sir  said i  i have eaten a whole breast of a chicken already  and cannot eat so much  but he said  i must eat it for his sake  and he would teach me to eat heartily  so i did eat it  but was much confused at his so kind and unusual freedom and condescension  and  good lack  you can t imagine how mrs  jewkes looked and stared  and how respectful she seemed to me  and called me good madam  i ll assure you  urging me to take a little bit of tart my master took two or three turns about the room  musing and thoughtful as i had never before seen him  and at last he went out  saying  i am going into the garden  you know  pamela  what i said to you before dinner  i rose  and courtesied  saying  i would attend his honour  and he said  do  good girl well  said mrs  jewkes  i see how things will go  o  madam  as she called me again  i am sure you are to be our mistress  and then i know what will become of me  ah mrs  jewkes  said i  if i can but keep myself virtuous  tis the most of my ambition  and i hope  no temptation shall make me otherwise notwithstanding i had no reason to be pleased with his treatment of me before dinner  yet i made haste to attend him  and i found him walking by the side of that pond  which  for want of grace  and through a sinful despondence  had like to have been so fatal to me  and the sight of which  ever since  has been a trouble and reproach to me  and it was by the side of this pond  and not far from the place where i had that dreaded conflict  that my present hopes  if i am not to be deceived again  began to dawn  which i presume to flatter myself with being a happy omen for me  as if god almighty would shew your poor sinful daughter  how well i did to put my affiance in his goodness  and not to throw away myself  because my ruin seemed inevitable  to my short sighted apprehension so he was pleased to say  well  pamela  i am glad you are come of your own accord  as i may say  give me your hand  i did so  and he looked at me very steadily  and pressing my hand all the time  at last said  i will now talk to you in a serious manner you have a good deal of wit  a great deal of penetration  much beyond your years  and  as i thought  your opportunities  you are possessed of an open  frank  and generous mind  and a person so lovely  that you excel all your sex  in my eyes  all these accomplishments have engaged my affection so deeply  that  as i have often said  i cannot live without you  and i would divide  with all my soul  my estate with you to make you mine upon my own terms  these you have absolutely rejected and that  though in saucy terms enough  yet in such a manner as makes me admire you the more  your pretty chit chat to mrs  jewkes  the last sunday night  so innocent  and so full of beautiful simplicity  half disarmed my resolution before i approached your bed  and i see you so watchful over your virtue  that though i hoped to find it otherwise  i cannot but confess my passion for you is increased by it  but now what shall i say farther  pamela i will make you  though a party  my adviser in this matter  though not  perhaps  my definitive judge you know i am not a very abandoned profligate  i have hitherto been guilty of no very enormous or vile actions  this of seizing you  and confining you thus  may perhaps be one of the worst  at least to persons of real innocence  had i been utterly given up to my passions  i should before now have gratified them  and not have shewn that remorse and compassion for you  which have reprieved you  more than once  when absolutely in my power  and you are as inviolate a virgin as you were when you came into my house but what can i do  consider the pride of my condition  i cannot endure the thought of marriage  even with a person of equal or superior degree to myself  and have declined several proposals of that kind  how then with the distance between us in the world s judgment  can i think of making you my wife yet i must have you  i cannot bear the thoughts of any other man supplanting me in your affections  and the very apprehension of that has made me hate the name of williams  and use him in a manner unworthy of my temper now  pamela  judge for me  and  since i have told you  thus candidly  my mind  and i see yours is big with some important meaning  by your eyes your blushes  and that sweet confusion which i behold struggling in your bosom  tell me  with like openness and candour  what you think i ought to do  and what you would have me do it is impossible for me to express the agitations of my mind  on this unexpected declaration  so contrary to his former behaviour  his manner too had something so noble  and so sincere  as i thought  that  alas for me  i found i had need of all my poor discretion  to ward off the blow which this treatment gave to my most guarded thoughts  i threw myself at his feet  for i trembled  and could hardly stand  o sir  said i  spare your poor servant s confusion  o spare the poor pamela speak out  said he  and tell me  when i bid you  what you think i ought to do  i cannot say what you ought to do  answered i  but i only beg you will not ruin me  and  if you think me virtuous  if you think me sincerely honest  let me go to my poor parents  i will vow to you  that i will never suffer myself to be engaged without your approbation still he insisted upon a more explicit answer to his question  of what i thought he ought to do  and i did  as to my poor thoughts of what you ought to do  i must needs say  that indeed i think you ought to regard the world s opinion  and avoid doing any thing disgraceful to your birth and fortune  and  therefore  if you really honour the poor pamela with your respect  a little time  absence  and the conversation of worthier persons of my sex  will effectually enable you to overcome a regard so unworthy your condition  and this  good sir  is the best advice i can offer charming creature  lovely pamela  said he  with an ardour that was never before so agreeable to me  this generous manner is of a piece with all the rest of your conduct  but tell me  still more explicitly what you would advise me to  in the case o  sir  said i  take not advantage of my credulity  and these my weak moments  but were i the first lady in the land  instead of the poor abject pamela  i would  i could tell you  but i can say no more o my dear father and mother  now i know you will indeed be concerned for me for now i am for myself and now i begin to be afraid i know too well the reason why all his hard trials of me  and my black apprehensions  would not let me hate him but be assured still  by god s grace  that i shall do nothing unworthy of your pamela  and if i find that he is still capable of deceiving me and that this conduct is only put on to delude me more  i shall think nothing in this world so vile  and so odious  and nothing  if he be not the worst of his kind  as he says  and  i hope  he is not  so desperately guileful  as the heart of man he generously said  i will spare your confusion  pamela  but i hope i may promise myself  that you can love me preferably to any other man and that no one in the world has had any share in your affections  for i am very jealous of what i love  and if i thought you had a secret whispering in your soul  that had not yet come up to a wish  for any other man breathing  i should not forgive myself to persist in my affection for you  nor you  if you did not frankly acquaint me with it as i still continued on my knees  on the grass border by the pond side he sat himself down on the grass by me  and took me in his arms  why hesitates my pamela  said he can you not answer me with truth  as i wish  if you cannot  speak  and i will forgive you o good sir  said i  it is not that  indeed it is not  but a frightful word or two that you said to mrs  jewkes  when you thought i was not in hearing  comes cross my mind  and makes me dread that i am in more danger than ever i was in my life you have never found me a common liar  said he  too fearful and foolish pamela  nor will i answer how long i may hold in my present mind  for my pride struggles hard within me  i ll assure you  and if you doubt me i have no obligation to your confidence or opinion  but  at present  i am really sincere in what i say  and i expect you will be so too  and answer directly my question i find  sir  said i  i know not myself  and your question is of such a nature  that i only want to tell you what i heard  and to have your kind answer to it  or else  what i have to say to your question  may pave the way to my ruin  and shew a weakness that i did not believe was in me well  said he  you may say what you have overheard  for  in not answering me directly  you put my soul upon the rack  and half the trouble i have had with you would have brought to my arms one of the finest ladies in england o sir  said i  my virtue is as dear to me  as if i was of the highest quality  and my doubts for which you know i have had too much reason have made me troublesome  but now  sir  i will tell you what i heard which has given me great uneasiness you talked to mrs  jewkes of having begun wrong with me  in trying to subdue me with terror  and of frost  and such like you remember it well and that you would  for the future  change your conduct  and try to melt me  that was your word  by kindness i fear not  sir  the grace of god supporting me  that any acts of kindness would make me forget what i owe to my virtue  but  sir  i may i find  be made more miserable by such acts  than by terror  because my nature is too frank and open to make me wish to be ungrateful  and if i should be taught a lesson i never yet learnt  with what regret should i descend to the grave  to think that i could not hate my undoer  and that  at the last great day  i must stand up as an accuser of the poor unhappy soul  that i could wish it in my power to save exalted girl  said he  what a thought is that why  now  pamela  you excel yourself  you have given me a hint that will hold me long  but sweet creature  said he  tell me what is this lesson  which you never yet learnt  and which you are so afraid of learning if  sir  said i  you will again generously spare my confusion  i need not speak it  but this i will say  in answer to the question you seem most solicitous about  that i know not the man breathing that i would wish to be married to  or that ever i thought of with such an idea  i had brought my mind so to love poverty  that i hoped for nothing but to return to the best  though the poorest of parents  and to employ myself in serving god  and comforting them  and you know not  sir  how you disappointed those hopes  and my proposed honest pleasures  when you sent me hither well then  said he  i may promise myself  that neither the parson  nor any other man  is any the least secret motive to your steadfast refusal of my offers  indeed  sir  said i  you may  and  as you was pleased to ask  i answer  that i have not the least shadow of a wish  or thought for any man living but  said he  for i am foolishly jealous  and yet it shews my fondness for you  have you not encouraged williams to think you will have him indeed  sir  said i  i have not  but the very contrary  and would you not have had him  said he  if you had got away by his means  i had resolved  sir  said i  in my mind  otherwise  and he knew it  and the poor man i charge you  said he  say not a word in his favour  you will excite a whirlwind in my soul  if you name him with kindness  and then you ll be borne away with the tempest sir  said i  i have done nay  said he  but do not have done  let me know the whole  if you have any regard for him  speak out  for it would end fearfully for you  for me  and for him  if i found that you disguised any secret of your soul from me  in this nice particular sir  said i  if i have ever given you cause to think me sincere say then  said he  interrupting me with great vehemence  and taking both my hands between his  say  that you now  in the presence of god  declare that you have not any the most hidden regard for williams  or any other man sir  said i  i do  as god shall bless me  and preserve my innocence i have not  well  said he  i will believe you  pamela  and in time perhaps  i may better bear that man s name  and  if i am convinced that you are not prepossessed  my vanity makes me assured  that i need not to fear a place in your esteem  equal  if not preferable  to any man in england  but yet it stings my pride to the quick  that you was so easily brought  and at such a short acquaintance  to run away with that college novice o good sir  said i  may i be heard one thing  and though i bring upon me your highest indignation  i will tell you  perhaps  the unnecessary and imprudent  but yet the whole truth my honesty i am poor and lowly  and am not entitled to call it honour was in danger  i saw no means of securing myself from your avowed attempts  you had shewed you would not stick at little matters  and what  sir  could any body have thought of my sincerity  in preferring that to all other considerations  if i had not escaped from these dangers  if i could have found any way for it i am not going to say any thing for him  but  indeed  indeed  sir  i was the cause of putting him upon assisting me in my escape  i got him to acquaint me what gentry there were in the neighbourhood that i might fly to  and prevailed upon him don t frown at me  good sir  for i must tell you the whole truth to apply to one lady jones  to lady darnford  and he was so good to apply to mr  peters  the minister  but they all refused me  and then it was he let me know  that there was no honourable way but marriage that i declined  and he agreed to assist me for god s sake now  said he  you are going i boldly put my hand before his mouth hardly knowing the liberty i took  pray  sir  said i  don t be angry i have just done i would only say  that rather than have staid to be ruined  i would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the world saw  if i thought him honest and i hope  when you duly weigh all matters  you will forgive me  and not think me so bold  and so forward as you have been pleased to call me well  said he  even in this your last speech  which  let me tell you shews more your honesty of heart than your prudence  you have not over much pleased me  but i must love you  and that vexes me not a little  but tell me  pamela  for now the former question recurs  since you so much prize your honour  and your virtue  since all attempts against that are so odious to you  and since i have avowedly made several of these attempts  do you think it is possible for you to love me preferably to any other of my sex ah  sir  said i  and here my doubt recurs  that you may thus graciously use me  to take advantage of my credulity still perverse and doubting  said he cannot you take me as i am at present  and that  i have told you  is sincere and undesigning  whatever i may be hereafter ah  sir  replied i  what can i say  i have already said too much  if this dreadful hereafter should take place  don t bid me say how well i can and then  my face glowing as the fire  i  all abashed  leaned upon his shoulder  to hide my confusion he clasped me to him with great ardour  and said  hide your dear face in my bosom  my beloved pamela  your innocent freedoms charm me but then say  how well what if you will be good  said i  to your poor servant  and spare her  i cannot say too much  but if not  i am doubly undone undone indeed said he  i hope my present temper will hold  for i tell you frankly that i have known  in this agreeable hour  more sincere pleasure than i have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul compelled me into  in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms  and pamela  you must pray for the continuance of this temper  and i hope your prayers will get the better of my temptations this sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves  i threw myself at his feet  and embraced his knees  what pleasure  sir  you give me at these gracious words  is not lent your poor servant to express i shall be too much rewarded for all my sufferings  if this goodness hold  god grant it may  for your own soul s sake as well as mine  and oh  how happy should i be  if he stopt me  and said  but  my dear girl  what must we do about the world  and the world s censure  indeed  i cannot marry now was i again struck all of a heap  however  soon recollecting myself sir  said i  i have not the presumption to hope such an honour  if i may be permitted to return in peace and safety to my poor parents  to pray for you there  it is all i at present request  this  sir  after all my apprehensions and dangers  will be a great pleasure to me  and  if i know my own poor heart  i shall wish you happy in a lady of suitable degree  and rejoice most sincerely in every circumstance that shall make for the happiness of my late good lady s most beloved son well  said he  this conversation  pamela  is gone farther than i intended it  you need not be afraid  at this rate  of trusting yourself with me  but it is i that ought to be doubtful of myself  when i am with you but before i say any thing farther on this subject  i will take my proud heart to task  and  till then  let every thing be as if this conversation had never passed  only  let me tell you  that the more confidence you place in me  the more you ll oblige me  but your doubts will only beget cause of doubts  and with this ambiguous saying  he saluted me with a more formal manner  if i may so say  than before  and lent me his hand  and so we walked toward the house  side by side  he seeming very thoughtful and pensive  as if he had already repented him of his goodness what shall i do  what steps take  if all this be designing o the perplexities of these cruel doubtings to be sure  if he be false  as i may call it  i have gone too far  much too far i am ready  on the apprehension of this  to bite my forward tongue or rather to beat my more forward heart  that dictated to that poor machine  for what i have said  but sure  at least  he must be sincere for the time he could not be such a practised dissembler if he could  o how desperately wicked is the heart of man and where could he learn all these barbarous arts if so  it must be native surely to the sex but  silent be my rash censurings  be hushed  ye stormy tumults of my disturbed mind  for have i not a father who is a man a man who knows no guile  who would do no wrong who would not deceive or oppress  to gain a kingdom how then can i think it is native to the sex  and i must also hope my good lady s son cannot be the worst of men if he is  hard the lot of the excellent woman that bore him but much harder the hap of your poor pamela  who has fallen into such hands but yet i will trust in god and hope the best  and so lay down my tired pen for this time thursday morning somebody rapped at our chamber door this morning  soon after it was light  mrs  jewkes asked  who it was  my master said  open the door mrs  jewkes  o  said i  for god s sake  mrs  jewkes  don t  indeed  said she  but i must  then  said i  and clung about her  let me slip on my clothes first  but he rapped again  and she broke from me  and i was frightened out of my wits  and folded myself in the bed clothes  he entered  and said  what  pamela  so fearful  after what passed yesterday between us  o  sir  sir  said i  i fear my prayers have wanted their wished effect  pray  good sir  consider he sat down on the bed side and interrupted me  no need of your foolish fears  i shall say but a word or two  and go away after you went up stairs  said he  i had an invitation to a ball  which is to be this night at stamford  on occasion of a wedding  and i am going to call on sir simon  and his lady and daughters  for the bride is a relation of theirs  so i shall not be at home till saturday  i come therefore  to caution you  mrs  jewkes  before pamela  that she may not wonder at being closer confined  than for these three or four days past  that nobody sees her  nor delivers any letter to her  in that space  for a person has been seen lurking about  and inquiring after her  and i have been well informed  that either mrs  jervis  or mr longman  has written a letter  with a design of having it conveyed to her  and  said he  you must know  pamela  that i have ordered mr longman to give up his accounts  and have dismissed jonathan and mrs  jervis  since i have been here  for their behaviour has been intolerable  and they have made such a breach between my sister davers and me  as we shall never  perhaps  make up  now  pamela  i shall take it kindly in you  if you will confine yourself to your chamber pretty much  for the time i am absent  and not give mrs  jewkes cause of trouble or uneasiness  and the rather  as you know she acts by my orders alas  sir  said i  i fear all these good people have suffered for my sake why  said he  i believe so too  and there was never a girl of your innocence  that set a large family in such an uproar  surely but let that pass  you know both of you my mind  and  in part  the reason of it  i shall only say  that i have had such a letter from my sister  as i could not have expected  and  pamela  said he  neither you nor i have reason to thank her  as you shall know  perhaps at my return i go in my coach  mrs  jewkes  because i take lady darnford  and mrs  peters s niece  and one of lady darnford s daughters  along with me  and sir simon and his other daughter go in his chariot  so let all the gates be fastened  and don t take any airing in either of the chariots  nor let any body go to the gate  without you  mrs  jewkes  i ll be sure  said she  to obey your honour i will give mrs  jewkes no trouble  sir  said i  and will keep pretty much in my chamber  and not stir so much as into the garden without her to shew you i will obey in every thing i can  but i begin to fear ay said he  more plots and contrivances  don t you but i ll assure you you never had less reason  and i tell you the truth  for i am really going to stamford this time  and upon the occasion i tell you  and so pamela  give me your hand  and one kiss  and then i am gone i durst not refuse  and said  god bless you  sir  wherever you go but i am sorry for what you tell me about your servants he and mrs  jewkes had a little talk without the door  and i heard her say  you may depend  sir  upon my care and vigilance he went in his coach  as he said he should  and very richly dressed which looks as if what he said was likely  but really i have been used to so many tricks  and plots  and surprises  that i know not what to think  but i mourn for poor mrs  jervis so here is parson williams here s poor naughty john  here is good mrs  jervis  and mr  longman  and mr  jonathan  turned away for me mr  longman is rich  indeed  and so need the less matter it  but i know it will grieve him  and for poor mr jonathan  i am sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart  alas for me  what mischiefs am i the occasion of or  rather  my master whose actions towards me have made so many of my kind friends forfeit his favour  for my sake i am very sad about these things  if he really loved me  methinks he should not be so angry  that his servants loved me too i know not what to think friday night i have removed my papers from under the rose bush  for i saw the gardener begin to dig near that spot  and i was afraid he would find them mrs  jewkes and i were looking yesterday through the iron gate that fronts the elms  and a gipsy like body made up to us  and said  if madam  you will give me some broken victuals  i will tell you both your fortunes  i said  let us hear our fortunes  mrs  jewkes  she said  i don t like these sort of people  but we will hear what she ll say to us  however  i shan t fetch you any victuals  woman  but i will give you some pence  said she but nan coming out  she said  fetch some bread  and some of the cold meat  and you shall have your fortune told  nan this  you ll think  like some of my other matters  a very trifling thing to write about  but mark the discovery of a dreadful plot  which i have made by it  o  bless me  what can i think of this naughty  this very naughty gentleman now will i hate him most heartily  thus it was mrs  jewkes had no suspicion of the woman  the iron gate being locked and she on the outside  and we on the inside  and so put her hand through  she said  muttering over a parcel of cramp words  why  madam you will marry soon  i can tell you  at that she seemed pleased  and said  i am glad to hear that  and shook her fat sides with laughing the woman looked most earnestly at me  all the time  and as if she had meaning  then it came into my head  from my master s caution  that possibly this woman might be employed to try to get a letter into my hands  and i was resolved to watch all her motions  so mrs  jewkes said what sort of a man shall i have  pray why  said she  a man younger than yourself  and a very good husband he ll prove i am glad of that said she  and laughed again  come  madam  let us hear your fortune the woman came to me  and took my hand  o  said she  i cannot tell your fortune  your hand is so white and fine  i cannot see the lines  but said she  and  stooping  pulled up a little tuft of grass  i have a way for that  and so rubbed my hand with the mould part of the tuft  now said she  i can see the lines mrs  jewkes was very watchful of all her ways  and took the tuft  and looked upon it  lest any thing should be in that  and then the woman said  here is the line of jupiter crossing the line of life  and mars odd  my pretty mistress  said she  you had best take care of yourself  for you are hard beset  i ll assure you  you will never be married  i can see  and will die of your first child  out upon thee woman  said i  better thou hadst never come here said mrs  jewkes  whispering  i don t like this  it looks like a cheat pray  mrs  pamela  go in  this moment  so i will  said i  for i have enough of fortune telling  and in i went the woman wanted sadly to tell me more  which made mrs  jewkes threaten her  suspecting still the more  and away the woman went  having told nan her fortune  and she would be drowned this thing ran strongly in all our heads  and we went  an hour after  to see if the woman was lurking about  and took mr  colbrand for our guard looking through the iron gate  he spied a man sauntering about the middle of the walk  which filled mrs  jewkes with still more suspicions and she said  mr  colbrand  you and i will walk towards this fellow  and see what he saunters there for  and  nan  do you and madam stay at the gate so they opened the iron gate and walked down towards the man  and guessing the woman  if employed  must mean something by the tuft of grass  i cast my eye that way  whence she pulled it  and saw more grass seemingly pulled up  then i doubted not something was there for me  and i walked to it  and standing over it  said to nan  that s a pretty sort of wild flower  that grows yonder  near the elm  the fifth from us on the left  pray pull it for me  said she  it is a common weed  well  said i  but pull it for me  there are sometimes beautiful colours in a weed while she went on  i stooped  and pulled up a good handful of the grass and in it a bit of paper  which i put instantly in my bosom  and dropt the grass  and my heart went pit a pat at the odd adventure  said i let s go in  mrs  anne  no  said she  we must stay till mrs  jewkes comes i was all impatience to read this paper  and when colbrand and she returned  i went in  said she  certainly there is some reason for my master s caution  i can make nothing of this sauntering fellow  but to be sure  there was some roguery in the gipsy  well  said i  if there was  she lost her aim  you see  ay  very true  said she  but that was owing to my watchfulness  and you was very good to go away  when i spoke to you i hastened up stairs to my closet  and found the billet to contain  in a hand that seemed disguised  and bad spelling  the following words twenty contrivances have been thought of to let you know your danger but all have proved in vain  your friends hope it is not yet too late to give you this caution  if it reaches your hands  the squire is absolutely determined to ruin you  and  because he despairs of any other way  he will pretend great love and kindness to you  and that he will marry you  you may expect a parson  for this purpose  in a few days  but it is a sly artful fellow  of a broken attorney  that he has hired to personate a minister  the man has a broad face  pitted much with the small pox  and is a very great companion  so take care of yourself doubt not this advice  perhaps you ll have had but too much reason already to confirm you in the truth of it  from your zealous well wisher  somebody now  my dear father and mother  what shall we say of this truly diabolical master  o  how shall i find words to paint my griefs  and his deceit  i have as good as confessed i love him  but  indeed  it was on supposing him good this  however  has given him too much advantage but now i will break this wicked forward heart of mine  if it will not be taught to hate him  o  what a black dismal heart must he have  so here is a plot to ruin me  and by my own consent to no wonder he did not improve his wicked opportunities  which i thought owing to remorse for his sin  and compassion for me  when he had such a project as this in reserve here should i have been deluded with the hopes of a happiness that my highest ambition could have had aspired to but how dreadful must have been my lot  when i had found myself an undone creature  and a guilty harlot  instead of a lawful wife  oh  this is indeed too much  too much  for your poor pamela to support  this is the worse  as i hoped all the worst was over  and that i had the pleasure of beholding a reclaimed man  and not an abandoned libertine  what now must your poor daughter do  now all her hopes are dashed  and if this fails him  then comes  to be sure  my forced disgrace  for this shews he will never leave till he has ruined me o  the wretched  wretched pamela saturday noon  one o clock my master is come home  and  to be sure  has been where he said  so once he has told truth  and this matter seems to be gone off without a plot no doubt he depends upon his sham wicked marriage  he has brought a gentleman with him to dinner  and so i have not seen him yet two o clock i am very sorrowful  and still have greater reason  for  just now  as i was in my closet  opening the parcel i had hid under the rose bush to see if it was damaged by lying so long  mrs  jewkes came upon me by surprise  and laid her hands upon it  for she had been looking through the key hole  it seems i know not what i shall do  for now he will see all my private thoughts of him  and all my secrets  as i may say  what a careless creature i am to be sure i deserve to be punished you know i had the good luck  by mr  williams s means  to send you all my papers down to sunday night  the th day of my imprisonment  but now these papers contain all my matters from that time  to wednesday the th day of my distress  and which  as you may now  perhaps  never see i will briefly mention the contents to you in these papers  then  are included  an account of mrs  jewkes s arts to draw me in to approve of mr  williams s proposal for marriage  and my refusing to do so  and desiring you not to encourage his suit to me  mr williams s being wickedly robbed  and a visit of hers to him  whereby she discovered all his secrets  how i was inclined to get off  while she was gone  but was ridiculously prevented by my foolish fears  etc  my having the key of the back door  mrs  jewkes s writing to my master all the secrets she had discovered of mr  williams  and her behaviour to me and him upon it  continuance of my correspondence with mr  williams by the tiles  begun in the parcel you had  my reproaches to him for his revealing himself to mrs  jewkes  and his letter to me in answer threatening to expose my master  if he deceived him  mentioning in it john arnold s correspondence with him  and a letter which john sent  and was intercepted  as it seems  of the correspondence being carried on by a friend of his at gainsborough  of the horse he was to provide for me and one for himself  of what mr  williams had owned to mrs  jewkes  and of my discouraging his proposals  then it contained a pressing letter of mine to him  urging my escape before my master came  with his half angry answer to me  your good letter to me  my dear father  sent to me by mr  williams s conveyance  in which you would have me encourage mr williams  but leave it to me  and in which  fortunately enough  you take notice of my being uninclined to marry my earnest desire to be with you  the substance of my answer to mr  williams  expressing more patience  etc  a dreadful letter of my master to mrs  jewkes  which  by mistake  was directed to me  and one to me  directed by like mistake to her  and very free reflections of mine upon both  the concern i expressed for mr  williams s being taken in  deceived  and ruined an account of mrs  jewkes s glorying in her wicked fidelity  a sad description i gave of monsieur colbrand  a person he sent down to assist mrs  jewkes in watching me  how mr  williams was arrested  and thrown into gaol  and the concern i expressed upon it  and my free reflections on my master for it  a projected contrivance of mine  to get away out of the window  and by the back door  and throwing by petticoat and handkerchief into the pond to amuse them  while i got off  an attempt that had like to have ended very dreadfully for me  my further concern for mr  williams s ruin  on my account  and  lastly  my over hearing mrs  jewkes brag of her contrivance to rob mr  williams  in order to get at my papers  which  however  he preserved  and sent safe to you these  down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape  are to the best of my remembrance  the contents of the papers  which this merciless woman seized  for  how badly i came off  and what followed  i still have safe  as i hope  sewed in my under coat  about my hips in vain were all my prayers and tears to her  to get her not to shew them to my master  for she said  it had now come out  why i affected to be so much alone  and why i was always writing  and she thought herself happy  she said  she had found these  for often and often had she searched every place she could think of  for writings  to no purpose before  and she hoped  she said  there was nothing in them by what any body might see  for  said she  you know you are all innocence insolent creature  said i  i am sure you are all guilt and so you must do your worst  for now i can t help myself  and i see there is no mercy to be expected from you just now  my master being come up  she went to him upon the stairs  and gave him my papers  there  sir  said she  you always said mrs  pamela was a great writer  but i never could get at any thing of hers before he took them  and  without coming to me  went down to the parlour again and what with the gipsy affair  and what with this  i could not think of going down to dinner  and she told him that too  and so i suppose i shall have him up stairs  as soon as his company is gone saturday  six o clock my master came up  and  in a pleasanter manner than i expected said  so  pamela  we have seized  it seems  your treasonable papers treasonable  said i  very sullenly  ay  said he  i suppose so  for you are a great plotter  but i have not read them yet then  sir  said i  very gravely  it will be truly honourable in you not to read them  but to give them to me again  to whom  says he  are they written to my father  sir  but i suppose you see to whom indeed returned he  i have not read three lines yet  then  pray  sir  don t read them  but give them to me again  that i will not  said he  till i have read them  sir  said i  you served me not well in the letters i used to write formerly  i think it was not worthy your character to contrive to get them in your hands  by that false john arnold  for should such a gentleman as you mind what your poor servant writes yes said he  by all means  mind what such a servant as my pamela writes your pamela  thought i  then the sham marriage came into my head  and indeed it has not been out of it  since the gipsy affair but  said he  have you any thing in these papers you would not have me see  to be sure  sir  said i  there is  for what one writes to one s father and mother  is not for every body to see  nor  said he  am i every body those letters  added he  that i did see by john s means  were not to your disadvantage  i ll assure you  for they gave me a very high opinion of your wit and innocence  and if i had not loved you  do you think i would have troubled myself about your letters alas  sir  said i  great pride to me that  for they gave you such an opinion of my innocence  that you was resolved to ruin me  and what advantage have they brought me who have been made a prisoner  and used as i have been between you and your housekeeper why  pamela  said he  a little seriously  why this behaviour  for my goodness to you in the garden this is not of a piece with your conduct and softness there  that quite charmed me in your favour  and you must not give me cause to think that you will be the more insolent  as you find me kinder  ah  sir  said i  you know best your own heart and designs  but i fear i was too open hearted then  and that you still keep your resolution to undo me  and have only changed the form of your proceedings when i tell you once again  said he  a little sternly  that you cannot oblige me more  than by placing some confidence in me  i will let you know  that these foolish and perverse doubts are the worst things you can be guilty of  but  said he  i shall possibly account for the cause of them  in these papers of yours  for i doubt not you have been sincere to your father and mother  though you begin to make me suspect you  for i tell you  perverse girl  that it is impossible you should be thus cold and insensible  after what has passed in the garden  if you were not prepossessed in some other person s favour  and let me add  that if i find it so  it shall be attended with such effects  as will make every vein in your heart bleed he was going away in wrath  and i said  one word  good sir  one word before you read them  since you will read them  pray make allowances for all the harsh reflections that you will find in them on your own conduct to me  and remember only  that they were not written for your sight  and were penned by a poor creature hardly used  and who was in constant apprehension of receiving from you the worst treatment that you could inflict upon her if that be all  said he  and there be nothing of another nature  that i cannot forgive  you have no cause for uneasiness  for i had as many instances of your saucy reflections upon me in your former letters  as there were lines  and yet  you see  i have never upbraided you on that score  though  perhaps  i wished you had been more sparing of your epithets  and your freedoms of that sort well  sir  said i  since you will  you must read them  and i think i have no reason to be afraid of being found insincere  or having  in any respect  told you a falsehood  because  though i don t remember all i wrote  yet i know i wrote my heart  and that is not deceitful  and remember  sir  another thing  that i always declared i thought myself right to endeavour to make my escape from this forced and illegal restraint  and so you must not be angry that i would have done so  if i could i ll judge you  never fear  said he  as favourably as you deserve  for you have too powerful a pleader within me  and so went down stairs about nine o clock he sent for me down into the parlour  i went a little fearfully  and he held the paper in his hand  and said  now  pamela you come upon your trial  said i  i hope i have a just judge to hear my cause  ay  said he  and you may hope for a merciful one too  or else i know not what will become of you i expect  continued he  that you will answer me directly  and plainly to every question i shall ask you in the first place  here are several love letters between you and williams  love letters  sir  said i well call them what you will  said he  i don t entirely like them  i ll assure you  with all the allowances you desired me to make for you  do you find  sir  said i  that i encouraged his proposal  or do you not why  said he  you discourage his address in appearance  but no otherwise than all your cunning sex do to ours  to make us more eager in pursuing you well  sir  said i  that is your comment  but it does not appear so in the text  smartly said  says he  where a d l gottest thou  at these years  all this knowledge  and then thou hast a memory  as i see by your papers  that nothing escapes  alas  sir  said i  what poor abilities i have  serve only to make me more miserable i have no pleasure in my memory  which impresses things upon me  that i could be glad never were or everlastingly to forget well  said he  so much for that but where are the accounts since you have kept so exact a journal of all that has befallen you  previous to these here in my hand  my father has them  sir  said i by whose means said he by mr  williams s  said i  well answered  said he  but cannot you contrive to get me a sight of them  that would be pretty  said i  i wish i could have contrived to have kept those you have from your sight said he  i must see them  pamela  or i shall never be easy  for i must know how this correspondence between you and williams began  and if i can see them  it shall be better for you  if they answer what these give me hope they will i can tell you  sir  very faithfully  said i  what the beginning was for i was bold enough to be the beginner  that won t do  said he for though this may appear a punctilio to you  to me it is of high importance  sir  said i  if you please to let me go to my father  i will send them to you by any messenger you shall send for them  will you so but i dare say  if you will write for them  they will send them to you without the trouble of such a journey to yourself  and i beg you will i think  sir  said i  as you have seen all my former letters through john s baseness  and now these  through your faithful housekeeper s officious watchfulness  you might see all the rest  but i hope you will not desire it  till i can see how much my pleasing you in this particular will be of use to myself you must trust to my honour for that  but tell me  pamela  said the sly gentleman  since i have seen these  would you have voluntarily shewn me those  had they been in your possession i was not aware of this inference  and said  yes  truly  sir  i think i should  if you commanded it  well then  pamela  said he  as i am sure you have found means to continue your journal  i desire  till the former part can come  that you will shew me the succeeding o sir  sir  said i  have you caught me so but indeed you must excuse me there why  said he  tell me truly  have you not continued your account till now  don t ask me  sir  said i  but i insist upon your answer  replied he  why then  sir  i will not tell an untruth  i have that s my good girl  said he  i love sincerity at my heart in another  sir  said i i presume you mean well  said he  i ll allow you to be a little witty upon me  because it is in you  and you cannot help it  but you will greatly oblige me  to shew me voluntarily what you have written  i long to see the particulars of your plot  and your disappointment  where your papers leave off  for you have so beautiful a manner  that it is partly that  and partly my love for you  that has made me desirous of reading all you write  though a great deal of it is against myself  for which you must expect to suffer a little  and as i have furnished you with the subject  i have a title to see the fruits of your pen besides  said he  there is such a pretty air of romance  as you relate them  in your plots  and my plots  that i shall be better directed in what manner to wind up the catastrophe of the pretty novel if i was your equal  sir  said i  i should say this is a very provoking way of jeering at the misfortunes you have brought upon me o  said he  the liberties you have taken with my character in your letters  sets us upon a par  at least in that respect  sir  i could not have taken those liberties  if you had not given me the cause  and the cause  sir  you know  is before the effect true  pamela  said he  you chop logic very prettily  what the deuse do we men go to school for  if our wits were equal to women s  we might spare much time and pains in our education  for nature teaches your sex  what  in a long course of labour and study  ours can hardly attain to but  indeed  every lady is not a pamela you delight to banter your poor servant  said i nay  continued he  i believe i must assume to myself half the merit of your wit  too  for the innocent exercises you have had for it  from me have certainly sharpened your invention sir  said i  could i have been without those innocent exercises  as you are pleased to call them  i should have been glad to have been as dull as a beetle  but then  pamela  said he  i should not have loved you so well  but then  sir  i should have been safe  easy  and happy ay  may be so  and may be not  and the wife  too  of some clouterly plough boy but then  sir  i should have been content and innocent  and that s better than being a princess  and not so  and may be not  said he  for if you had had that pretty face  some of us keen fox hunters should have found you out  and  in spite of your romantic notions  which then  too perhaps  would not have had so strong a place in your mind  might have been more happy with the ploughman s wife  than i have been with my mother s pamela  i hope  sir  said i  god would have given me more grace well  but  resumed he  as to these writings of yours  that follow your fine plot  i must see them  indeed  sir  you must not  if i can help it  nothing  said he  pleases me better  than that  in all your arts shifts  and stratagems  you have had a great regard to truth  and have in all your little pieces of deceit  told very few wilful fibs  now i expect you ll continue this laudable rule in your conversation with me let me know then  where you have found supplies of pen  ink  and paper  when mrs  jewkes was so vigilant  and gave you but two sheets at a time tell me truth why  sir  little did i think i should have such occasion for them  but when i went away from your house  i begged some of each of good mr longman  who gave me plenty  yes  yes  said he  it must be good mr longman  all your confederates are good  every one of them  but such of my servants as have done their duty  and obeyed my orders  are painted out by you as black as devils  nay  so am i too  for that matter sir  said i  i hope you won t be angry  but  saving yourself  do you think they are painted worse than they deserve  or worse than the parts they acted require you say  saving myself  pamela  but is not that saying a mere compliment to me  because i am present  and you are in my hands  tell me truly good sir  excuse me  but i fancy i might ask you  why you should think so  if there was not a little bit of conscience that told you there was but too much reason for it he kissed me  and said  i must either do thus  or be angry with you  for you are very saucy  pamela but  with your bewitching chit chat  and pretty impertinence  i will not lose my question  where did you hide your paper  pens  and ink some  sir  in one place  some in another  that i might have some left if others should be found that s a good girl  said he  i love you for your sweet veracity  now tell me where it is you hide your written papers  your saucy journal i must beg your excuse for that  sir  said i  but indeed  answered he  you will not have it  for i will know  and i will see them this is very hard  sir  said i  but i must say  you shall not  if i can help it we were standing most of this time  but he then sat down  and took me by both my hands  and said  well said  my pretty pamela  if you can help it  but i will not let you help it  tell me  are they in your pocket no  sir  said i  my heart up at my mouth  said he  i know you won t tell a downright fib for the world  but for equivocation  no jesuit ever went beyond you  answer me then  are they in neither of your pockets  no sir  said i  are they not  said he  about your stays  no  sir  replied i  but pray no more questions  for ask me ever so much  i will not tell you o  said he  i have a way for that  i can do as they do abroad  when the criminals won t confess  torture them till they do but pray  sir  said i  is this fair  just  or honest  i am no criminal  and i won t confess o  my girl  said he  many an innocent person has been put to the torture  but let me know where they are  and you shall escape the question  as they call it abroad sir  said i  the torture is not used in england  and i hope you won t bring it up  admirably said  said the naughty gentleman but i can tell you of as good a punishment  if a criminal won t plead with us  here in england  we press him to death  or till he does plead  and so now pamela  that is a punishment shall certainly be yours  if you won t tell without tears stood in my eyes  and i said  this  sir  is very cruel and barbarous no matter  said he  it is but like your lucifer  you know in my shape  and  after i have done so many heinous things by you as you think  you have no great reason to judge so hardly of this  or  at least  it is but of a piece with the rest but  sir  said i  dreadfully afraid he had some notion they were about me  if you will be obeyed in this unreasonable manner  though it is sad tyranny  to be sure let me go up to them  and read them over again and you shall see so far as to the end of the sad story that follows those you have i ll see them all  said he  down to this time  if you have written so far or  at least  till within this week then let me go up to them said i  and see what i have written  and to what day  to shew them to you  for you won t desire to see every thing  but i will  replied he but say  pamela  tell me truth  are they above  i was much affrighted  he saw my confusion  tell me truth  said he  why  sir answered i  i have sometimes hid them under the dry mould in the garden sometimes in one place  sometimes in another  and those you have in your hand  were several days under a rose bush  in the garden  artful slut said he  what s this to my question are they not about you if  said i  i must pluck them out of my hiding place behind the wainscot  won t you see me still more and more artful  said he is this an answer to my question i have searched every place above  and in your closet  for them  and cannot find them  so i will know where they are  now  said he it is my opinion they are about you  and i never undressed a girl in my life  but i will now begin to strip my pretty pamela  and i hope i shall not go far before i find them i fell a crying  and said  i will not be used in this manner  pray  sir said i  for he began to unpin my handkerchief  consider  pray sir do and pray  said he  do you consider  for i will see these papers but may be  said he  they are tied about your knees  with your garters and stooped  was ever any thing so vile and so wicked i fell on my knees  and said  what can i do  what can i do  if you ll let me go up i ll fetch them to you  will you  said he  on your honour  let me see them uncurtailed  and not offer to make them away  no not a single paper i will  sir on your honour  yes  sir  and so he let me go up stairs  crying sadly for vexation to be so used  sure nobody was ever so served as i am i went to my closet  and there i sat me down  and could not bear the thoughts of giving up my papers  besides  i must all undress me  in a manner  to untack them  so i writ thus sir to expostulate with such an arbitrary gentleman  i know will signify nothing  and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have got over me  i have heart enough  sir  to do a deed that would make you regret using me thus  and i can hardly bear it  and what i am further to undergo  but a superior consideration withholds me  thank god  it does i will  however  keep my word  if you insist upon it when you have read this  but  sir  let me beg of you to give me time till to morrow morning  that i may just run them over  and see what i put into your hands against me  and i will then give my papers to you without the least alteration  or adding or diminishing  but i should beg still to be excused  if you please  but if not  spare them to me but till to morrow morning  and this  so hardly am i used  shall be thought a favour  which i shall be very thankful for i guessed it would not be long before i heard from him and he accordingly sent up mrs  jewkes for what i had promised  so i gave her this note to carry to him  and he sent word  that i must keep my promise  and he would give me till morning  but that i must bring them to him  without his asking again so i took off my under coat  and with great trouble of mind  unsewed them from it  and there is a vast quantity of it  i will just slightly touch upon the subjects  because i may not  perhaps  get them again for you to see they begin with an account of my attempting to get away out of the window first  and then throwing my petticoat and handkerchief into the pond  how sadly i was disappointed  the lock of the back door being changed  how  in trying to climb over the door  i tumbled down  and was piteously bruised  the bricks giving way  and tumbling upon me  how finding i could not get off  and dreading the hard usage i should receive  i was so wicked as to think of throwing myself into the water my sad reflections upon this matter  how mrs  jewkes used me upon this occasion  when she found me  how my master had like to have been drowned in hunting  and my concern for his danger  notwithstanding his usage of me  mrs  jewkes s wicked reports  to frighten me  that i was to be married to the ugly swiss  who was to sell me on the wedding day to my master  her vile way of talking to me  like a london prostitute  my apprehensions of seeing preparations made for my master s coming  her causeless fears that i was trying to get away again  when i had no thoughts of it  and my bad usage upon it  my master s dreadful arrival and his hard  very hard treatment of me  and mrs  jewkes s insulting of me  his jealousy of mr  williams and me  how mrs  jewkes vilely instigated him to wickedness  and down to here  i put into one parcel hoping that would content him  but for fear it should not  i put into another parcel the following  viz a copy of his proposals to me  of a great parcel of gold  and fine clothes and rings  and an estate of i can t tell what a year  and l  a year for the life of both you  my dear parents  to be his mistress  with an insinuation  that  may be  he would marry me at the year s end  all sadly vile  with threatenings  if i did not comply  that he would ruin me  without allowing me any thing  a copy of my answer  refusing all with just abhorrence  but begging at last his goodness towards me  and mercy on me  in the most moving manner i could think of  an account of his angry behaviour  and mrs  jewkes s wicked advice hereupon  his trying to get me to his chamber  and my refusal to go  a deal of stuff and chit chat between me and the odious mrs  jewkes  in which she was very wicked and very insulting  two notes i wrote  as if to be carried to church  to pray for his reclaiming  and my safety  which mrs jewkes seized  and officiously shewed him  a confession of mine  that notwithstanding his bad usage  i could not hate him  my concern for mr williams  a horrid contrivance of my master s to ruin me  being in my room  disguised in clothes of the maid s  who lay with me and mrs jewkes  how narrowly i escaped  it makes my heart ache to think of it still  by falling into fits  mrs  jewkes s detestable part in this sad affair  how he seemed moved at my danger  and forbore his abominable designs  and assured me he had offered no indecency  how ill i was for a day or two after  and how kind he seemed  how he made me forgive mrs jewkes  how  after this  and great kindness pretended  he made rude offers to me in the garden  which i escaped  how i resented them  then i had written  how kindly he behaved himself to me  and how he praised me  and gave me great hopes of his being good at last  of the too tender impression this made upon me  and how i began to be afraid of my own weakness and consideration for him  though he had used me so ill how sadly jealous he was of mr  williams  and how i  as justly could cleared myself as to his doubts on that score  how  just when he had raised me up to the highest hope of his goodness  he dashed me sadly again  and went off more coldly  my free reflections upon this trying occasion this brought down matters from thursday  the th day of my imprisonment  to wednesday the st  and here i was resolved to end  let what would come  for only thursday  friday  and saturday  remain to give an account of  and thursday he set out to a ball at stamford  and friday was the gipsy story  and this is saturday  his return from stamford  and truly  i shall have but little heart to write  if he is to see all so these two parcels of papers i have got ready for him against to morrow morning  to be sure i have always used him very freely in my writings  and shewed him no mercy  but yet he must thank himself for it  for i have only writ truth  and i wish he had deserved a better character at my hands  as well for his own sake as mine so  though i don t know whether ever you ll see what i write  i must say  that i will go to bed  with remembering you in my prayers  as i always do  and as i know you do me  and so  my dear parents  good night sunday morning i remembered what he said  of not being obliged to ask again for my papers  and what i should be forced to do  and could not help  i thought i might as well do in such a manner as might shew i would not disoblige on purpose  though i stomached this matter very heavily too  i had therefore got in readiness my two parcels  and he  not going to church in the morning  bid mrs  jewkes tell me he was gone into the garden i knew that was for me to go to him  and so i went  for how can i help being at his beck  which grieves me not a little  though he is my master  as i may say  for i am so wholly in his power  that it would do me no good to incense him  and if i refused to obey him in little matters  my refusal in greater would have the less weight  so i went down to the garden  but as he walked in one walk  i took another  that i might not seem too forward neither he soon spied me  and said  do you expect to be courted to come to me sir  said i  and crossed the walk to attend him  i did not know but i should interrupt you in your meditations this good day was that the case  said he  truly  and from your heart  why  sir  said i  i don t doubt but you have very good thoughts sometimes  though not towards me  i wish  said he  i could avoid thinking so well of you as i do  but where are the papers i dare say you had them about you yesterday  for you say in those i have  that you will bury your writings in the garden  for fear you should be searched  if you did not escape this  added he  gave me a glorious pretence to search you  and i have been vexing myself all night  that i did not strip you garment by garment  till i had found them  o fie  sir  said i  let me not be scared  with hearing that you had such a thought in earnest well  said he  i hope you have not now the papers to give me  for i had rather find them myself  i ll assure you i did not like this way of talk at all  and thinking it best not to dwell upon it  said  well  but  sir  you will excuse me  i hope  giving up my papers don t trifle with me  said he  where are they i think i was very good to you last night  to humour you as i did  if you have either added or diminished  and have not strictly kept your promise  woe be to you indeed  sir  said i  i have neither added nor diminished  but there is the parcel that goes on with my sad attempt to escape  and the terrible consequences it had like to have been followed with  and it goes down to the naughty articles you sent me  and as you know all that has happened since  i hope these will satisfy you he was going to speak  but i said  to drive him from thinking of any more  and i must beg you  sir  to read the matter favourably  if i have exceeded in any liberties of my pen i think  said he  half smiling  you may wonder at my patience  that i can be so easy to read myself abused as i am by such a saucy slut sir said i  i have wondered you should be so desirous to see my bold stuff and  for that very reason  i have thought it a very good  or a very bad sign  what  said he  is your good sign that it may have an effect upon your temper  at last  in my favour  when you see me so sincere  your bad sign  why  that if you can read my reflections and observations upon your treatment of me  with tranquillity  and not be moved  it is a sign of a very cruel and determined heart  now  pray  sir  don t be angry at my boldness in telling you so freely my thoughts  you may  perhaps  said he  be least mistaken  when you think of your bad sign  god forbid  said i so i took out my papers  and said  here  sir  they are  but if you please to return them  without breaking the seal  it will be very generous  and i will take it for a great favour  and a good omen he broke the seal instantly  and opened them  so much for your omen replied he  i am sorry for it  said i  very seriously  and was walking away  whither now  said he  i was going in  sir  that you might have time to read them  if you thought fit  he put them into his pocket  and said  you have more than these  yes  sir  but all they contain  you know as well as i but i don t know  said he  the light you put things in and so give them me  if you have not a mind to be searched sir  said i  i can t stay  if you won t forbear that ugly word give me then no reason for it  where are the other papers  why  then  unkind sir  if it must be so  here they are  and so i gave him  out of my pocket  the second parcel  sealed up  as the former  with this superscription  from the naughty articles  down  through sad attempts to thursday the d day of my imprisonment  this is last thursday  is it  yes  sir  but now you will see what i write  i will find some other way to employ my time  for how can i write with any face  what must be for your perusal  and not for those i intended to read my melancholy stories yes  said he  i would have you continue your penmanship by all means and  i assure you  in the mind i am in  i will not ask you for any after these  except any thing very extraordinary occurs  and i have another thing to tell you  added he  that if you send for those from your father  and let me read them  i may  very probably  give them all back again to you  and so i desire you will do it this a little encourages me to continue my scribbling  but  for fear of the worst  i will  when they come to any bulk  contrive some way to hide them  if i can  that i may protest i have them not about me  which before  i could not say of a truth  and that made him so resolutely bent to try to find them upon me  for which i might have suffered frightful indecencies he led me  then  to the side of the pond  and sitting down on the slope made me sit by him  come  said he  this being the scene of part of your project  and where you so artfully threw in some of your clothes  i will just look upon that part of your relation  sir  said i  let me then walk about  at a little distance  for i cannot bear the thought of it  don t go far  said he when he came  as i suppose  to the place where i mentioned the bricks falling upon me  he got up  and walked to the door  and looked upon the broken part of the wall  for it had not been mended  and came back reading on to himself  towards me  and took my hand  and put it under his arm why  this  said he  my girl  is a very moving tale  it was a very desperate attempt  and  had you got out  you might have been in great danger  for you had a very bad and lonely way  and i had taken such measures  that  let you have been where you would  i should have had you you may see  sir  said i  what i ventured  rather than be ruined  and you will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession that my honesty is dearer to me than my life  romantic girl  said he and read on he was very serious at my reflections  on what god had enabled me to escape  and when he came to my reasonings about throwing myself into the water  he said  walk gently before  and seemed so moved  that he turned away his face from me  and i blessed this good sign  and began not so much to repent at his seeing this mournful part of my story he put the papers in his pocket  when he had read my reflections  and thanks for escaping from myself  and said  taking me about the waist  o my dear girl  you have touched me sensibly with your mournful relation and your sweet reflections upon it  i should truly have been very miserable had it taken effect  i see you have been used too roughly  and it is a mercy you stood proof in that fatal moment then he most kindly folded me in his arms  let us  say i too  my pamela walk from this accursed piece of water  for i shall not  with pleasure look upon it again  to think how near it was to have been fatal to my fair one  i thought  added he  of terrifying you to my will  since i could not move you by love  and mrs  jewkes too well obeyed me  when the terrors of your return  after your disappointment  were so great  that you had hardly courage to withstand them  but had like to have made so fatal a choice  to escape the treatment you apprehended o sir  said i  i have reason  i am sure  to bless my dear parents and my good lady  your mother  for giving me something of a religious education  for  but for that  and god s grace  i should  more than upon one occasion  have attempted  at least  a desperate act  and i the less wonder how poor creatures  who have not the fear of god before their eyes  and give way to despondency  cast themselves into perdition come  kiss me  said he  and tell me you forgive me for pushing you into so much danger and distress  if my mind hold  and i can see those former papers of yours  and that these in my pocket give me no cause to altar my opinion  i will endeavour to defy the world and the world s censures and make my pamela amends  if it be in the power of my whole life  for all the hardships i have made her undergo all this looked well  but you shall see how strangely it was all turned for this sham marriage then came into my mind again  and i said  your poor servant is far unworthy of this great honour  for what will it be but to create envy to herself  and discredit to you  therefore  sir permit me to return to my poor parents  and that is all i have to ask he was in a fearful passion then  and is it thus  said he  in my fond conceding moments  that i am to be despised and answered precise perverse  unseasonable pamela  begone from my sight  and know as well how to behave in a hopeful prospect  as in a distressful state  and then  and not till then  shalt thou attract the shadow of my notice i was startled  and going to speak  but he stamped with his foot  and said  begone  i tell you  i cannot bear this stupid romantic folly one word  said i  but one word  i beseech you  sir he turned from me in great wrath  and took down another alley  and so i went  with a very heavy heart  and fear i was too unseasonable  just at a time when he was so condescending  but if it was a piece of art of his side  as i apprehended  to introduce the sham wedding  and  to be sure he is very full of stratagem and art  i think i was not so much to blame so i went up to my closet  and wrote thus far  while he walked about till dinner was ready  and he is now sat down to it  as i hear by mrs jewkes  very sullen  thoughtful  and out of humour  and she asks  what i have done to him now  again  i dread to see him when will my fears be over three o clock well  he continues exceeding wrath  he has ordered his travelling chariot to be got ready with all speed  what is to come next  i wonder sure i did not say so much but see the lordliness of a high condition a poor body must not put in a word  when they take it into their heads to be angry  what a fine time a person of an equal condition would have of it  if she were even to marry such a one his poor dear mother spoiled him at first  nobody must speak to him or contradict him as i have heard  when he was a child  and so he has not been used to be controlled  and cannot bear the least thing that crosses his violent will  this is one of the blessings attending men of high condition  much good may do them with their pride of birth  and pride of fortune  say i all that it serves for  as far as i can see  is  to multiply their disquiets  and every body s else that has to do with them so  so  where will this end mrs  jewkes has been with me from him and she says  i must get out of the house this moment  well  said i  but whither am i to be carried next  why  home  said she  to your father and mother  and can it be  said i  no  no  i doubt i shall not be so happy as that to be sure some bad design is on foot again  to be sure it is sure  sure  said i  mrs  jewkes  he has not found out some other housekeeper worse than you  she was very angry  you may well think  but i know she can t be made worse than she is she came up again  are you ready  said she  bless me  said i  you are very hasty  i have heard of this not a quarter of an hour ago  but i shall be soon ready  for i have but little to take with me  and no kind friends in this house to take leave of  to delay me  yet  like a fool  i can t help crying pray  said i  just step down  and ask  if i may not have my papers so  i am quite ready now  against she comes up with an answer  and so i will put up these few writings in my bosom  that i have left i don t know what to think nor how to judge  but i shall never believe i am with you  till i am on my knees before you  begging both your blessings  yet i am sorry he is so angry with me  i thought i did not say so much there is  i see  the chariot drawn out  the horses too  the grim colbrand going to get on horseback  what will be the end of all this monday well  where this will end  i cannot say  but here i am  at a little poor village  almost such a one as yours  i shall learn the name of it by and by  and robin assures me  he has orders to carry me to you  my dear father and mother  o that he may say truth  and not deceive me again but having nothing else to do  and i am sure i shall not sleep a wink to night  if i was to go to bed  i will write my time away  and take up my story where i left off  on sunday afternoon mrs  jewkes came up to me  with this answer about my papers  my master says  he will not read them yet  lest he should be moved by any thing in them to alter his resolution  but if he should think it worth while to read them  he will send them to you  afterwards  to your father s  but said she  here are your guineas that i borrowed  for all is over now with you  i find she saw me cry  and said  do you repent of what  said i nay  i can t tell  replied she  but  to be sure  he has had a taste of your satirical flings  or he would not be so angry  o  continued she  and held up her hand  thou hast a spirit but i hope it will now be brought down i hope so too  said i well  added i  i am ready  she lifted up the window  and said  i ll call robin to take your portmanteau  bag and baggage  proceeded she  i m glad you re going  i have no words  said i  to throw away upon you  mrs jewkes  but  making her a very low courtesy  i most heartily thank you for all your virtuous civilities to me  and so adieu  for i ll have no portmanteau  i ll assure you  nor any thing but these few things that i brought with me in my handkerchief  besides what i have on  for i had all this time worn my own bought clothes  though my master would have had it otherwise often  but i had put up paper  ink  and pens  however so down i went  and as i passed by the parlour  she stepped in  and said  sir  you have nothing to say to the girl before she goes  i heard him reply  though i did not see him  who bid you say  the girl  mrs jewkes  in that manner  she has offended only me i beg your honour s pardon  said the wretch  but if i was your honour she should not  for all the trouble she has cost you  go away scot free no more of this  as i told you before  said he  what  when i have such proof  that her virtue is all her pride  shall i rob her of that no added he  let her go  perverse and foolish as she is  but she deserves to go honest  and she shall go so i was so transported with this unexpected goodness  that i opened the door before i knew what i did  and said  falling on my knees at the door  with my hands folded  and lifted up  o thank you  thank your honour  a million of times may god bless you for this instance of your goodness to me  i will pray for you as long as i live  and so shall my dear father and mother  and  mrs  jewkes  said i  i will pray for you too  poor wicked wretch that you are he turned from me  and went into his closet  and shut the door  he need not have done so  for i would not have gone nearer to him surely i did not say so much  to incur all this displeasure i think i was loath to leave the house  can you believe it what could be the matter with me  i wonder i felt something so strange  and my heart was so lumpish i wonder what ailed me but this was so unexpected i believe that was all yet i am very strange still surely  surely  i cannot be like the old murmuring israelites  to long after the onions and garlick of egypt  when they had suffered there such heavy bondage i ll take thee  o lumpish  contradictory  ungovernable heart  to severe task  for this thy strange impulse  when i get to my dear father s and mother s  and if i find any thing in thee that should not be  depend upon it thou shalt be humbled  if strict abstinence prayer  and mortification  will do it but yet  after all  this last goodness of his has touched me too sensibly  i wish i had not heard it  almost  and yet  methinks  i am glad i did  for i should rejoice to think the best of him  for his own sake well  and so i went out to the chariot  the same that brought me down so  mr  robert  said i  here i am again  a poor sporting piece for the great  a mere tennis ball of fortune  you have your orders  i hope  yes madam  said he  pray  now  said i  don t madam me  nor stand with your hat off to such a one as i  had not my master  said he  ordered me not to be wanting in respect to you  i would have shewn you all i could well  said i  with my heart full  that s very kind  mr  robert mr  colbrand  mounted on horseback  with pistols before him  came up to me  as soon as i got in  with his hat off too  what  monsieur  said i are you to go with me part of the way  he said  to see you safe  i hope that s kind too  in you  mr  colbrand  said i i had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now  nor to take leave of  and so i resigned myself to my contemplations  with this strange wayward heart of mine  that i never found so ungovernable and awkward before so away drove the chariot and when i had got out of the elm walk  and into the great road  i could hardly think but i was in a dream all the time  a few hours before  in my master s arms almost  with twenty kind things said to me  and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had brought upon me  and only by one rash half word exasperated against me  and turned out of doors  at an hour s warning  and all his kindness changed to hate  and i now  from three o clock to five  several miles off  but if i am going to you  all will be well again  i hope lack a day  what strange creatures are men  gentlemen  i should say rather  for  my dear deserving good mother  though poverty be both your lots  has had better hap  and you are  and have always been  blest in one another yet this pleases me too  he was so good  he would not let mrs  jewkes speak ill of me  and scorned to take her odious unwomanly advice  o  what a black heart has this poor wretch  so i need not rail against men so much  for my master  bad as i have thought him  is not half so bad as this woman to be sure she must be an atheist do you think she is not we could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse rather than inn  for it began to be dark  and robin did not make so much haste as he might have done  and he was forced to make hard shift for his horses mr  colbrand  and robert too  are very civil  i see he has got my portmanteau lashed behind the coach  i did not desire it  but i shall not come quite empty a thorough riddance of me  i see bag and baggage  as mrs  jewkes says well  my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel  if it was to be well told mr  robert came up to me  just now  and begged me to eat something  i thanked him  but said  i could not eat  i bid him ask mr  colbrand to walk up  and he came  but neither of them would sit  nor put their hats on  what mockado is this  to such a poor soul as i  i asked them  if they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with me  if not  i would not desire it they both said  robin was ordered to carry me to my father s  and mr  colbrand was to leave me within ten miles  and then strike off for the other house  and wait till my master arrived there  they both spoke so solemnly  that i could not but believe them but when robin went down  the other said  he had a letter to give me next day at noon  when we baited  as we were to do  at mrs  jewkes s relation s may i not  said i  beg the favour to see it to night  he seemed so loath to deny me  that i have hopes i shall prevail on him by and by well  my dear father and mother  i have got the letter  on great promises of secrecy  and making no use of it  i will try if i can open it without breaking the seal  and will take a copy of it by and by  for robin is in and out  there being hardly any room in this little house for one to be long alone  well  this is the letter when these lines are delivered to you  you will be far on your way to your father and mother  where you have so long desired to be  and  i hope  i shall forbear thinking of you with the least shadow of that fondness my foolish heart had entertained for you  i bear you  however no ill will  but the end of my detaining you being over  i would not that you should tarry with me an hour more than needed  after the ungenerous preference you gave  at a time that i was inclined to pass over all other considerations  for an honourable address to you  for well i found the tables entirely turned upon me  and that i was in far more danger from you  than you were from me  for i was just upon resolving to defy all the censures of the world  and to make you my wife i will acknowledge another truth  that  had i not parted with you as i did  but permitted you to stay till i had read your journal  reflecting as i doubt not i shall find it  and till i had heard your bewitching pleas in your own behalf  i feared i could not trust myself with my own resolution  and this is the reason  i frankly own  that i have determined not to see you  nor hear you speak  for well i know my weakness in your favour but i will get the better of this fond folly  nay  i hope i have already done it  since it was likely to cost me so dear  and i write this to tell you  that i wish you well with all my heart  though you have spread such mischief through my family and yet i cannot but say that i could wish you would not think of marrying in haste  and particularly  that you would not have this cursed williams but what is all this to me now only  my weakness makes me say  that as i had already looked upon you as mine  and you have so soon got rid of your first husband  so you will not refuse  to my memory  the decency that every common person observes  to pay a twelvemonth s compliment  though but a mere compliment  to my ashes your papers shall be faithfully returned you  and i have paid so dear for my curiosity in the affection they have rivetted upon me for you that you would look upon yourself amply revenged if you knew what they have cost me i thought of writing only a few lines  but i have run into length  i will now try to recollect my scattered thoughts  and resume my reason and shall find trouble enough to replace my affairs  and my own family and to supply the chasms you have made in it  for  let me tell you though i can forgive you  i never can my sister  nor my domestics  for my vengeance must be wreaked somewhere i doubt not your prudence in forbearing to expose me any more than is necessary for your own justification  and for that i will suffer myself to be accused by you  and will also accuse myself  if it be needful  for i am  and will ever be  your affectionate well wisher this letter  when i expected some new plot  has affected me more than any thing of that sort could have done  for here is plainly his great value for me confessed  and his rigorous behaviour accounted for in such a manner  as tortures me much  and all this wicked gipsy story is  as it seems  a forgery upon us both  and has quite ruined me  for  o my dear parents  forgive me  but i found  to my grief  before  that my heart was too partial in his favour  but now with so much openness  so much affection  nay  so much honour too  which was all i had before doubted and kept me on the reserve  i am quite overcome  this was a happiness however  i had no reason to expect  but  to be sure  i must own to you  that i shall never be able to think of any body in the world but him presumption  you will say  and so it is  but love is not a voluntary thing  love  did i say but come  i hope not at least it is not  i hope  gone so far as to make me very uneasy  for i know not how it came  nor when it began  but crept  crept it has  like a thief  upon me  and before i knew what was the matter  it looked like love i wish  since it is too late  and my lot determined  that i had not had this letter  nor heard him take my part to that vile woman  for then i should have blessed myself in having escaped so happily his designing arts upon my virtue  but now my poor mind is all topsy turvied  and i have made an escape to be more a prisoner but i hope  since thus it is  that all will be for the best  and i shall  with your prudent advice  and pious prayers  be able to overcome this weakness but  to be sure  my dear sir  i will keep a longer time than a twelvemonth  as a true widow  for a compliment  and more than a compliment  to your ashes  o the dear word how kind  how moving how affectionate is the word  o why was i not a duchess  to shew my gratitude for it  but must labour under the weight of an obligation even had this happiness befallen me  that would have pressed me to death  and which i never could return by a whole life of faithful love and cheerful obedience o forgive your poor daughter i am sorry to find this trial so sore upon me  and that all the weakness of my weak sex  and tender years  who never before knew what it was to be so touched  is come upon me  and too mighty to be withstood by me but time  prayer  and resignation to god s will  and the benefits of your good lessons  and examples  i hope will enable me to get over this so heavy a trial o my treacherous  treacherous heart  to serve me thus  and give no notice to me of the mischiefs thou wast about to bring upon me but thus foolishly to give thyself up to the proud invader  without ever consulting thy poor mistress in the least  but thy punishment will be the first and the greatest  and well deservest thou to smart  o perfidious traitor  for giving up so weakly thy whole self  before a summons came  and to one  too  who had used me so hardly  and when likewise  thou hadst so well maintained thy post against the most violent and avowed  and  therefore  as i thought  more dangerous attacks after all  i must either not shew you this my weakness  or tear it out of my writing  memorandum  to consider of this  when i get home monday morning  eleven o clock we are just come in here  to the inn kept by mrs  jewkes s relation  the first compliment i had  was in a very impudent manner  how i liked the squire i could not help saying  bold  forward woman  is it for you who keep an inn  to treat passengers at this rate  she was but in jest she said  and asked pardon  and she came  and begged excuse again  very submissively  after robin and mr  colbrand had talked to her a little the latter here  in great form  gave me  before robin  the letter which i had given him back for that purpose  and i retired  as if to read it  and so i did  for i think i can t read it too often  though  for my peace of mind s sake  i might better try to forget it  i am sorry methinks  i cannot bring you back a sound heart  but  indeed  it is an honest one  as to any body but me  for it has deceived nobody else wicked thing that it is more and more surprising things still just as i had sat down  to try to eat a bit of victuals  to get ready to pursue my journey  came in mr  colbrand in a mighty hurry  o madam madam  said he  here be de groom from de squire b  all over in a lather  man and horse  o how my heart went pit a pat  what now  thought i  is to come next  he went out  and presently returned with a letter for me  and another  enclosed  for mr  colbrand  this seemed odd  and put me all in a trembling  so i shut the door  and never  sure  was the like known  found the following agreeable contents in vain  my pamela  do i find it to struggle against my affection for you  i must needs  after you were gone  venture to entertain myself with your journal  when i found mrs  jewkes s bad usage of you  after your dreadful temptations and hurts  and particularly your generous concern for me  on hearing how narrowly i escaped drowning  though my death would have been your freedom  and i had made it your interest to wish it  and your most agreeable confession in another place  that notwithstanding all my hard usage of you  you could not hate me  and that expressed in so sweet  so soft  and so innocent a manner  that i flatter myself you may be brought to love me  together with the other parts of your admirable journal  i began to repent my parting with you but  god is my witness  for no unlawful end  as you would call it  but the very contrary  and the rather  as all this was improved in your favour  by your behaviour at leaving my house  for  oh  that melodious voice praying for me at your departure  and thanking me for my rebuke to mrs  jewkes  still hangs upon my ears  and delights my memory  and though i went to bed  i could not rest  but about two got up  and made thomas get one of the best horses ready  in order to set out to overtake you  while i sat down to write this to you now  my dear pamela  let me beg of you  on the receipt of this  to order robin to drive you back again to my house  i would have set out myself  for the pleasure of bearing you company back in the chariot  but am really indisposed  i believe  with vexation that i should part thus with my soul s delight  as i now find you are  and must be  in spite of the pride of my own heart you cannot imagine the obligation your return will lay me under to your goodness  and yet  if you will not so far favour me  you shall be under no restraint  as you will see by my letter enclosed to colbrand  which i have not sealed  that you may read it  but spare me  my dearest girl the confusion of following you to your father s  which i must do  if you persist to go on  for i find i cannot live a day without you if you are the generous pamela i imagine you to be  for hitherto you have been all goodness  where it has not been merited  let me see  by this new instance  the further excellence of your disposition  let me see you can forgive the man who loves you more than himself  let me see by it  that you are not prepossessed in any other person s favour  and one instance more i would beg  and then i am all gratitude  and that is that you would despatch monsieur colbrand with a letter to your father assuring him that all will end happily  and to desire  that he will send to you  at my house  the letters you found means  by williams s conveyance  to send him  and when i have all my proud  and  perhaps punctilious doubts answered  i shall have nothing to do  but to make you happy  and be so myself  for i must be yours  and only yours monday morn  near three o clock o my exulting heart  how it throbs in my bosom  as if it would reproach me for so lately upbraiding it for giving way to the love of so dear a gentleman but take care thou art not too credulous neither  o fond believer  things that we wish  are apt to gain a too ready credence with us  this sham marriage is not yet cleared up  mrs  jewkes  the vile mrs jewkes  may yet instigate the mind of this master  his pride of heart and pride of condition  may again take place  and a man that could in so little a space  first love me  then hate  then banish me his house and send me away disgracefully  and now send for me again  in such affectionate terms  may still waver  may still deceive thee  therefore will i not acquit thee yet  o credulous  fluttering  throbbing mischief that art so ready to believe what thou wishest  and i charge thee to keep better guard than thou hast lately done  and lead me not to follow too implicitly thy flattering and desirable impulses  thus foolishly dialogued i with my heart  and yet  all the time  this heart is pamela i opened the letter to monsieur colbrand  which was in these words monsieur i am sure you ll excuse the trouble i give you  i have  for good reasons  changed my mind  and i have besought it  as a favour  that mrs andrews will return to me the moment tom reaches you  i hope  for the reasons i have given her  she will have the goodness to oblige me  but if not  you are to order robin to pursue his directions  and set her down at her father s door  if she will oblige me in her return  perhaps she ll give you a letter to her father  for some papers to be delivered to you for her  which you ll be so good  in that case  to bring to her here  but if she will not give you such a letter  you ll return with her to me  if she please to favour me so far  and that with all expedition that her health and safety will permit  for i am pretty much indisposed but hope it will be but slight  and soon go off  i am yours  etc on second thoughts  let tom go forward with mrs  andrews s letter  if she pleases to give one  and you return with her  for her safety now this is a dear generous manner of treating me  o how i love to be generously used now  my dear parents  i wish i could consult you for your opinions  how i should act  should i go back  or should i not i doubt he has got too great hold in my heart  for me to be easy presently  if i should refuse  and yet this gipsy information makes me fearful well  i will  i think  trust in his generosity  yet is it not too great a trust especially considering how i have been used but then that was while he avowed his bad designs  and now he gives great hope of his good ones  and i may be the means of making many happy  as well as myself  by placing a generous confidence in him and then  i think  he might have sent to colbrand  or to robin  to carry me back  whether i would or not  and how different is his behaviour to that  and would it not look as if i was prepossessed  as he calls it  if i don t oblige him  and as if it was a silly female piece of pride  to make him follow me to my father s  and as if i would use him hardly in my turn  for his having used me ill in his  upon the whole  i resolved to obey him  and if he uses me ill afterwards  double will be his ungenerous guilt though hard will be my lot  to have my credulity so justly blamable  as it will then seem  for  to be sure  the world  the wise world  that never is wrong itself  judges always by events  and if he should use me ill  then i shall be blamed for trusting him  if well o then i did right  to be sure but how would my censurers act in my case  before the event justifies or condemns the action  is the question then i have no notion of obliging by halves  but of doing things with a grace  as one may say  where they are to be done  and so i wrote the desired letter to you  assuring you  that i had before me happier prospects than ever i had  and hoped all would end well  and that i begged you would send me  by the bearer  mr  thomas  my master s groom those papers  which i had sent you by mr  williams s conveyance  for that they imported me much  for clearing up a point in my conduct  that my master was desirous to know  before he resolved to favour me  as he had intended but you will have that letter  before you can have this for i would not send you this without the preceding  which now is in my master s hands and so  having given the letter to mr  thomas for him to carry to you  when he had baited and rested after his great fatigue  i sent for monsieur colbrand  and robin  and gave to the former his letter  and when he had read it  i said  you see how things stand  i am resolved to return to our master  and as he is not so well as were to be wished  the more haste you make the better  and don t mind my fatigue  but consider only yourselves  and the horses  robin  who guessed the matter  by his conversation with thomas  as i suppose  said  god bless you  madam and reward you  as your obligingness to my good master deserves  and may we all live to see you triumph over mrs  jewkes i wondered to hear him say so  for i was always careful of exposing my master  or even that naughty woman  before the common servants  but yet i question whether robin would have said this  if he had not guessed by thomas s message  and my resolving to return  that i might stand well with his master  so selfish are the hearts of poor mortals  that they are ready to change as favour goes so they were not long getting ready  and i am just setting out  back again  and i hope i shall have no reason to repent it robin put on very vehemently  and when we came to the little town  where we lay on sunday night  he gave his horses a bait  and said  he would push for his master s that night  as it would be moon light  if i should not be too much fatigued because there was no place between that and the town adjacent to his master s  fit to put up at  for the night  but monsieur colbrand s horse beginning to give way  made a doubt between them  wherefore i said  hating to be on the road  if it could be done i should bear it well enough  i hoped  and that monsieur colbrand might leave his horse  when it failed  at some house  and come into the chariot  this pleased them both  and  about twelve miles short  he left the horse  and took off his spurs and holsters  etc  and  with abundance of ceremonial excuses  came into the chariot  and i sat the easier for it  for my bones ached sadly with the jolting  and so many miles travelling in so few hours  as i have done  from sunday night  five o clock  but  for all this  it was eleven o clock at night  when we came to the village adjacent to my master s  and the horses began to be very much tired  and robin too  but i said  it would be pity to put up only three miles short of the house so about one we reached the gate  but every body was a bed  but one of the helpers got the keys from mrs  jewkes  and opened the gates  and the horses could hardly crawl into the stable  and i  when i went to get out of the chariot  fell down  and thought i had lost the use of my limbs mrs  jewkes came down with her clothes huddled on  and lifted up her hands and eyes  at my return  but shewed more care of the horses than of me  by that time the two maids came  and i made shift to creep in  as well as i could it seems my poor master was very ill indeed  and had been upon the bed most part of the day  and abraham who succeeded john  sat up with him and he was got into a fine sleep  and heard not the coach come in  nor the noise we made  for his chamber lies towards the garden on the other side of the house  mrs  jewkes said  he had a feverish complaint and had been blooded  and  very prudently  ordered abraham  when he awaked  not to tell him i was come  for fear of surprising him  and augmenting his fever  nor  indeed  to say any thing of me  till she herself broke it to him in the morning  as she should see how he was so i went to bed with mrs  jewkes  after she had caused me to drink almost half a pint of burnt wine  made very rich and cordial  with spices  which i found very refreshing  and set me into a sleep i little hoped for tuesday morning getting up pretty early  i have written thus far  while mrs  jewkes lies snoring in bed  fetching up her last night s disturbance  i long for her rising  to know how my poor master does  tis well for her she can sleep so purely  no love  but for herself  will ever break her rest  i am sure  i am deadly sore all over  as if i had been soundly beaten  i did not think i could have lived under such fatigue mrs  jewkes  as soon as she got up  went to know how my master did  and he had had a good night  and  having drank plentifully of sack whey had sweated much  so that his fever had abated considerably  she said to him  that he must not be surprised  and she would tell him news  he asked  what  and she said  i was come  he raised himself up in his bed can it be  said he what  already she told him i came last night monsieur colbrand coming to inquire of his health  he ordered him to draw near him  and was highly pleased with the account he gave him of the journey  my readiness to come back  and my willingness to reach home that night  and he said  why  these tender fair ones  i think  bear fatigue better than us men  but she is very good  to give me such an instance of her readiness to oblige me  pray  mrs  jewkes  said he  take great care of her health  and let her be a bed all day  she told him i had been up these two hours  ask her  said he  if she will be so good as to make me a visit  if she won t  i ll rise  and go to her  indeed  sir said she  you must be still  and i ll go to her  but don t urge her too much  said he  if she be unwilling she came to me  and told me all the above  and i said  i would most willingly wait upon him  for  indeed  i longed to see him  and was much grieved he was so ill so i went down with her  will she come  said he  as i entered the room  yes  sir  said we  and she said  at the first word  most willingly sweet excellence  said he as soon as he saw me  he said  o my beloved pamela  you have made me quite well  i m concerned to return my acknowledgments to you in so unfit a place and manner  but will you give me your hand  i did  and he kissed it with great eagerness  sir  said i  you do me too much honour i am sorry you are so ill i can t be ill  said he  while you are with me  i am very well already well  said he  and kissed my hand again  you shall not repent this goodness  my heart is too full of it to express myself as i ought  but i am sorry you have had such a fatiguing time of it life is no life without you  if you had refused me  and yet i had hardly hopes you would oblige me  i should have had a severe fit of it  i believe  for i was taken very oddly  and knew not what to make of myself  but now i shall be well instantly  you need not  mrs  jewkes  added he  send for the doctor from stamford  as we talked yesterday  for this lovely creature is my doctor  as her absence was my disease he begged me to sit down by his bed side  and asked me  if i had obliged him with sending for my former packet  i said i had  and hoped it would be brought  he said it was doubly kind i would not stay long because of disturbing him  and he got up in the afternoon  and desired my company  and seemed quite pleased  easy and much better  he said  mrs  jewkes  after this instance of my good pamela s obligingness in her return  i am sure we ought to leave her entirely at her own liberty  and pray  if she pleases to take a turn in our chariot  or in the garden  or to the town  or wherever she will let her be left at liberty  and asked no questions  and do you do all in your power to oblige her  she said she would  to be sure he took my hand  and said  one thing i will tell you  pamela  because i know you will be glad to hear it  and yet not care to ask me  i had before you went  taken williams s bond for the money  for how the poor man had behaved i can t tell  but he could get no bail  and if i have no fresh reason given me  perhaps i shall not exact the payment  and he has been some time at liberty  and now follows his school  but  methinks  i could wish you would not see him at present sir  said i  i will not do any thing to disoblige you wilfully  and i am glad he is at liberty  because i was the occasion of his misfortunes i durst say no more  though i wanted to plead for the poor gentleman which  in gratitude  i thought i ought  when i could do him service  i said  i am sorry  sir  lady davers  who loves you so well  should have incurred your displeasure  and that there should be any variance between your honour and her  i hope it was not on my account  he took out of his waistcoat pocket  as he sat in his gown  his letter case  and said here  pamela  read that when you go up stairs  and let me have your thoughts upon it  and that will let you into the affair he said he was very heavy of a sudden  and would lie down  and indulge for that day  and if he was better in the morning  would take an airing in the chariot  and so i took my leave for the present  and went up to my closet  and read the letter he was pleased to put into my hands which is as follows brother i am very uneasy at what i hear of you  and must write  whether it please you or not  my full mind  i have had some people with me desiring me to interpose with you  and they have a greater regard for your honour  than  i am sorry to say it  you have yourself  could i think  that a brother of mine would so meanly run away with my late dear mother s waiting maid  and keep her a prisoner from all her friends  and to the disgrace of your own  but i thought  when you would not let the wench come to me on my mother s death  that you meant no good i blush for you  i ll assure you  the girl was an innocent  good girl  but i suppose that s over with her now  or soon will  what can you mean by this  let me ask you  either you will have her for a kept mistress  or for a wife  if the former  there are enough to be had without ruining a poor wench that my mother loved  and who really was a very good girl and of this you may be ashamed  as to the other  i dare say you don t think of it  but if you should  you would be utterly inexcusable consider  brother  that ours is no upstart family  but is as ancient as the best in the kingdom  and  for several hundreds of years  it has never been known  that the heirs of it have disgraced themselves by unequal matches  and you know you have been sought to by some of the best families in the nation  for your alliance  it might be well enough if you were descended of a family of yesterday  or but a remove or two from the dirt you seem so fond of  but  let me tell you  that i  and all mine  will renounce you for ever  if you can descend so meanly  and i shall be ashamed to be called your sister  a handsome man  as you are in your person  so happy in the gifts of your mind  that every body courts your company  and possessed of such a noble and clear estate  and very rich in money besides  left you by the best of fathers and mothers with such ancient blood in your veins  untainted  for you to throw away yourself thus  is intolerable  and it would be very wicked in you to ruin the wench too  so that i beg you will restore her to her parents and give her l  or so  to make her happy in some honest fellow of her own degree  and that will be doing something  and will also oblige and pacify                                         your much grieved sister if i have written too sharply  consider it is my love to you  and the shame you are bringing upon yourself  and i wish this may have the effect upon you  intended by your very loving sister this is a sad letter  my dear father and mother  and one may see how poor people are despised by the proud and the rich  and yet we were all on a foot originally  and many of these gentry  that brag of their ancient blood  would be glad to have it as wholesome  and as really untainted  as ours surely these proud people never think what a short stage life is  and that  with all their vanity  a time is coming  when they shall be obliged to submit to be on a level with us  and true said the philosopher  when he looked upon the skull of a king  and that of a poor man  that he saw no difference between them  besides  do they not know  that the richest of princes  and the poorest of beggars  are to have one great and tremendous judge  at the last day  who will not distinguish between them  according to their circumstances in life but  on the contrary  may make their condemnations the greater as their neglected opportunities were the greater  poor souls  how do i pity their pride o keep me  heaven  from their high condition  if my mind shall ever be tainted with their vice  or polluted with so cruel and inconsiderate a contempt of the humble estate which they behold with so much scorn but  besides  how do these gentry know  that  supposing they could trace back their ancestry for one  two  three  or even five hundred years that then the original stems of these poor families  though they have not kept such elaborate records of their good for nothingness  as it often proves  were not still deeper rooted and how can they be assured  that one hundred years hence  or two  some of those now despised upstart families may not revel in their estates  while their descendants may be reduced to the others  dunghills and  perhaps  such is the vanity  as well as changeableness  of human estates  in their turns set up for pride of family  and despise the others these reflections occurred to my thoughts  made serious by my master s indisposition  and this proud letter of the lowly lady davers  against the high minded pamela  lowly  i say  because she could stoop to such vain pride  and high minded i  because i hope i am too proud ever to do the like but  after all  poor wretches that we be  we scarce know what we are  much less what we shall be but  once more pray i to be kept from the sinful pride of a high estate on this occasion i recall the following lines  which i have read  where the poet argues in a much better manner     wise providence      does various parts for various minds dispense      the meanest slaves  or those who hedge and ditch      are useful  by their sweat  to feed the rich      the rich  in due return  impart their store      which comfortably feeds the lab ring poor      nor let the rich the lowest slave disdain      he s equally a link of nature s chain      labours to the same end  joins in one view      and both alike the will divine pursue      and  at the last  are levell d  king and slave      without distinction  in the silent grave wednesday morning my master sent me a message just now  that he was so much better  that he would take a turn  after breakfast  in the chariot  and would have me give him my company  i hope i shall know how to be humble  and comport myself as i should do  under all these favours mrs  jewkes is one of the most obliging creatures in the world  and i have such respects shewn me by every one  as if i was as great as lady davers but now  if this should all end in the sham marriage it cannot be  i hope  yet the pride of greatness and ancestry  and such like is so strongly set out in lady davers s letter  that i cannot flatter myself to be so happy as all these desirable appearances make for me should i be now deceived  i should be worse off than ever  but i shall see what light this new honour will procure me so i ll get ready  but i won t  i think  change my garb  should i do it  it would look as if i would be nearer on a level with him  and yet  should i not  it might be thought a disgrace to him  but i will  i think  open the portmanteau and  for the first time since i came hither  put on my best silk nightgown  but then that will be making myself a sort of right to the clothes i had renounced  and i am not yet quite sure i shall have no other crosses to encounter  so i will go as i am  for  though ordinary i am as clean as a penny  though i say it  so i ll e en go as i am except he orders otherwise  yet mrs  jewkes says  i ought to dress as fine as i can but i say  i think not  as my master is up  and at breakfast  i will venture down to ask him how he will have me be well  he is kinder and kinder  and  thank god  purely recovered how charmingly he looks  to what he did yesterday  blessed be god for it he arose  and came to me  and took me by the hand  and would set me down by him  and he said  my charming girl seemed going to speak  what would you say sir  said i  a little ashamed  i think it is too great an honour to go into the chariot with you  no  my dear pamela  said he  the pleasure of your company will be greater than the honour of mine  and so say no more on that head but  sir  said i  i shall disgrace you to go thus  you would grace a prince  my fair one  said the good  kind  kind gentleman  in that dress or any you shall choose  and you look so pretty  that  if you shall not catch cold in that round eared cap  you shall go just as you are  but sir  said i  then you ll be pleased to go a bye way  that it mayn t be seen you do so much honor to your servant  o my good girl  said he  i doubt you are afraid of yourself being talked of  more than me  for i hope by degrees to take off the world s wonder  and teach them to expect what is to follow  as a due to my pamela o the dear good man  there s for you  my dear father and mother did i not do well now to come back o could i get rid of my fears of this sham marriage  for all this is not yet inconsistent with that frightful scheme  i should be too happy so i came up  with great pleasure  for my gloves  and now wait his kind commands  dear  dear sir  said i to myself  as if i was speaking to him for god s sake let me have no more trials and reverses  for i could not bear it now  i verily think at last the welcome message came  that my master was ready  and so i went down as fast as i could  and he  before all the servants  handed me in  as if i was a lady  and then came in himself  mrs  jewkes begged he would take care he did not catch cold  as he had been ill  and i had the pride to hear his new coachman say  to one of his fellow servants  they are a charming pair  i am sure  tis pity they should be parted o my dear father and mother  i fear your girl will grow as proud as any thing  and  especially  you will think i have reason to guard against it  when you read the kind particulars i am going to relate he ordered dinner to be ready by two  and abraham  who succeeds john went behind the coach  he bid robin drive gently  and told me  he wanted to talk to me about his sister davers  and other matters  indeed  at first setting out he kissed me a little too often  that he did  and i was afraid of robin s looking back  through the fore glass  and people seeing us  as they passed  but he was exceedingly kind to me  in his words  as well  at last  he said you have  i doubt not  read  over and over  my sister s saucy letter and find  as i told you  that you are no more obliged to her than i am  you see she intimates  that some people had been with her  and who should they be  but the officious mrs  jervis  and mr  longman  and jonathan  and so that has made me take the measures i did in dismissing them my service i see  said he  you are going to speak on their behalfs  but your time is not come to do that  if ever i shall permit it my sister  says he  i have been beforehand with  for i have renounced her  i am sure i have been a kind brother to her  and gave her to the value of l  more than her share came to by my father s will  when i entered upon my estate  and the woman  surely  was beside herself with passion and insolence  when she wrote me such a letter  for well she knew i would not bear it  but you must know  pamela  that she is much incensed  that i will give no ear to a proposal of hers  of a daughter of my lord  who  said he  neither in person  or mind  or acquirements  even with all her opportunities  is to be named in a day with my pamela  but yet you see the plea  my girl  which i made to you before  of the pride of condition  and the world s censure  which  i own  sticks a little too close with me still  for a woman shines not forth to the public as man  and the world sees not your excellencies and perfections  if it did  i should entirely stand acquitted by the severest censures  but it will be taken in the lump  that here is mr  b  with such and such an estate  has married his mother s waiting maid  not considering there is not a lady in the kingdom that can out do her  or better support the condition to which she will be raised  if i should marry her  and  said he  putting his arm round me and again kissing me  i pity my dear girl too  for her part in this censure  for  here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the neighbouring gentry all around us  sister davers  you see  will never be reconciled to you  the other ladies will not visit you  and you will  with a merit superior to them all  be treated as if unworthy their notice  should i now marry my pamela  how will my girl relish all this won t these be cutting things to my fair one  for  as to me  i shall have nothing to do  but  with a good estate in possession  to brazen out the matter of my former pleasantry on this subject  with my companions of the chase  the green  and the assemblee  stand their rude jests for once or twice  and my fortune will create me always respect enough  i warrant you  but  i say  what will my poor girl do  as to her part  with her own sex  for some company you must keep  my station will not admit it to be with my servants  and the ladies will fly your acquaintance and still  though my wife  will treat you as my mother s waiting maid what says my girl to this you may well guess  my dear father and mother  how transporting these kind  these generous and condescending sentiments were to me i thought i had the harmony of the spheres all around me  and every word that dropped from his lips was as sweet as the honey of hybla to me oh sir  said i  how inexpressibly kind and good is all this  your poor servant has a much greater struggle than this to go through  a more knotty difficulty to overcome what is that  said he  a little impatiently  i will not forgive your doubts now no  sir  said i  i cannot doubt  but it is  how i shall support  how i shall deserve your goodness to me dear girl  said he and hugged me to his breast  i was afraid you would have made me angry again  but that i would not be  because i see you have a grateful heart and this your kind and cheerful return  after such cruel usage as you had experienced in my house  enough to make you detest the place  has made me resolve to bear any thing in you  but doubts of my honour  at a time when i am pouring out my soul  with a true and affectionate ardour before you but  good sir  said i  my greatest concern will be for the rude jests you will have yourself to encounter with  for thus stooping beneath yourself  for  as to me  considering my lowly estate  and little merit even the slights and reflections of the ladies will be an honour to me and i shall have the pride to place more than half their ill will to their envy at my happiness  and if i can  by the most cheerful duty  and resigned obedience  have the pleasure to be agreeable to you  i shall think myself but too happy  let the world say what it will he said  you are very good  my dearest girl  but how will you bestow your time  when you will have no visits to receive or pay  no parties of pleasure to join in  no card tables to employ your winter evenings  and even  as the taste is  half the day  summer and winter  and you have often played with my mother  too  and so know how to perform a part there  as well as in the other diversions  and i ll assure you  my girl i shall not desire you to live without such amusements  as my wife might expect  were i to marry a lady of the first quality o  sir  said i  you are all goodness  how shall i bear it but do you think  sir  in such a family as yours  a person whom you shall honour with the name of mistress of it  will not find useful employments for her time  without looking abroad for any others in the first place  sir  if you will give me leave  i will myself look into such parts of the family economy  as may not be beneath the rank to which i shall have the honour of being exalted  if any such there can be  and this  i hope  without incurring the ill will of any honest servant then  sir  i will ease you of as much of your family accounts  as i possibly can  when i have convinced you that i am to be trusted with them  and you know  sir  my late good lady made me her treasurer  her almoner  and every thing then  sir  if i must needs be visiting or visited  and the ladies won t honour me so much  or even if they would now and then  i will visit  if your goodness will allow me so to do  the sick poor in the neighbourhood around you  and administer to their wants and necessities  in such matters as may not be hurtful to your estate  but comfortable to them and entail upon you their blessings  and their prayers for your dear health and welfare then i will assist your housekeeper  as i used to do  in the making jellies  comfits  sweetmeats  marmalades  cordials  and to pot  and candy  and preserve for the uses of the family  and to make  myself  all the fine linen of it for yourself and me then  sir  if you will sometimes indulge me with your company  i will take an airing in your chariot now and then  and when you shall return home from your diversions on the green  or from the chase  or where you shall please to go  i shall have the pleasure of receiving you with duty  and a cheerful delight  and  in your absence  count the moments till you return  and you will  may be  fill up some part of my time  the sweetest by far  with your agreeable conversation  for an hour or two now and then  and be indulgent to the impertinent overflowings of my grateful heart  for all your goodness to me the breakfasting time  the preparations for dinner  and sometimes to entertain your chosen friends  and the company you shall bring home with you  gentlemen  if not ladies  and the supperings  will fill up a great part of the day in a very necessary manner and  may be  sir  now and then a good humoured lady will drop in  and i hope  if they do  i shall so behave myself  as not to add to the disgrace you will have brought upon yourself  for  indeed  i will be very circumspect  and try to be as discreet as i can  and as humble too as shall be consistent with your honour cards  tis true  i can play at  in all the usual games that our sex delight in  but this i am not fond of  nor shall ever desire to play unless to induce such ladies  as you may wish to see  not to abandon your house for want of an amusement they are accustomed to music  which our good lady taught me  will fill up some intervals  if i should have any and then  sir  you know  i love reading and scribbling  and though all the latter will be employed in the family accounts  between the servants and me  and me and your good self  yet reading  at proper times  will be a pleasure to me  which i shall be unwilling to give up  for the best company in the world  except yours  and  o sir  that will help to polish my mind  and make me worthier of your company and conversation  and with the explanations you will give me  of what i shall not understand will be a sweet employment  and improvement too but one thing  sir  i ought not to forget  because it is the chief  my duty to god will  i hope  always employ some good portion of my time with thanks for his superlative goodness to me  and to pray for you and myself  for you  sir  for a blessing on you  for your great goodness to such an unworthy creature  for myself  that i may be enabled to discharge my duty to you  and be found grateful for all the blessings i shall receive at the hands of providence  by means of your generosity and condescension with all this  sir  said i  can you think i shall be at a loss to pass my time  but  as i know  that every slight to me  if i come to be so happy  will be  in some measure  a slight to you  i will beg of you sir  not to let me go very fine in dress  but appear only so  as that you may not be ashamed of it after the honour i shall have of being called by your worthy name  for well i know  sir  that nothing so much excites the envy of my own sex  as seeing a person above them in appearance  and in dress  and that would bring down upon me an hundred saucy things  and low born brats  and i can t tell what there i stopped  for i had prattled a great deal too much so early  and he said  clasping me to him  why stops my dear pamela why does she not proceed  i could dwell upon your words all the day long  and you shall be the directress of your own pleasures  and your own time  so sweetly do you choose to employ it  and thus shall i find some of my own bad actions atoned for by your exemplary goodness  and god will bless me for your sake o  said he  what pleasure you give me in this sweet foretaste of my happiness  i will now defy the saucy  busy censurers of the world and bid them know your excellence  and my happiness  before they  with unhallowed lips  presume to judge of my actions  and your merit and let me tell you  my pamela  that i can add my hopes of a still more pleasing amusement  and what your bashful modesty would not permit you to hint  and which i will no otherwise touch upon  lest it should seem  to your nicety  to detract from the present purity of my good intentions  than to say  i hope to have superadded to all these  such an employment  as will give me a view of perpetuating my happy prospects and my family at the same time  of which i am almost the only male i blushed  i believe  yet could not be displeased at the decent and charming manner with which he insinuated this distant hope  and oh judge for me  how my heart was affected with all these things he was pleased to add another charming reflection  which shewed me the noble sincerity of his kind professions  i do own to you  my pamela said he  that i love you with a purer flame than ever i knew in my whole life  a flame to which i was a stranger  and which commenced for you in the garden  though you  unkindly  by your unseasonable doubts  nipped the opening bud  while it was too tender to bear the cold blasts of slight or negligence  and i know more sincere joy and satisfaction in this sweet hour s conversation with you  than all the guilty tumults of my former passion ever did  or had even my attempts succeeded  ever could have afforded me o  sir  said i  expect not words from your poor servant  equal to these most generous professions  both the means  and the will  i now see  are given to you  to lay me under an everlasting obligation  how happy shall i be  if  though i cannot be worthy of all this goodness and condescension  i can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it  but i can only answer for a grateful heart  and if ever i give you cause wilfully  and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfections to be disgusted with me  may i be an outcast from your house and favour and as much repudiated  as if the law had divorced me from you but sir  continued i  though i was so unseasonable as i was in the garden  you would  i flatter myself  had you then heard me  have pardoned my imprudence  and owned i had some cause to fear  and to wish to be with my poor father and mother  and this i the rather say that you should not think me capable of returning insolence for your goodness  or appearing foolishly ungrateful to you  when you was so kind to me indeed  pamela  said he  you gave me great uneasiness  for i love you too well not to be jealous of the least appearance of your indifference to me  or preference to any other person  not excepting your parents themselves  this made me resolve not to hear you  for i had not got over my reluctance to marriage  and a little weight  you know  turns the scale  when it hangs in an equal balance  but yet  you see  that though i could part with you  while my anger held  yet the regard i had then newly professed for your virtue  made me resolve not to offer to violate it  and you have seen likewise  that the painful struggle i underwent when i began to reflect  and to read your moving journal  between my desire to recall you  and my doubt whether you would return  though yet i resolved not to force you to it  had like to have cost me a severe illness  but your kind and cheerful return has dispelled all my fears and given me hope  that i am not indifferent to you  and you see how your presence has chased away my illness i bless god for it  said i  but since you are so good as to encourage me  and will not despise my weakness  i will acknowledge  that i suffered more than i could have imagined  till i experienced it  in being banished your presence in so much anger  and the more still was i affected  when you answered the wicked mrs  jewkes so generously in my favour  at my leaving your house  for this  sir  awakened all my reverence for you  and you saw i could not forbear  not knowing what i did  to break boldly in upon you  and acknowledge your goodness on my knees  tis true  my dear pamela  said he  we have sufficiently tortured one another  and the only comfort that can result from it  will be reflecting upon the matter coolly and with pleasure  when all these storms are overblown  as i hope they now are  and we sit together secured in each other s good opinion  recounting the uncommon gradations by which we have ascended to the summit of that felicity  which i hope we shall shortly arrive at meantime  said the good gentleman  let me hear what my dear girl would have said in her justification  could i have trusted myself with her  as to her fears  and the reason of her wishing herself from me  at a time that i had begun to shew my fondness for her  in a manner that i thought would have been agreeable to her and virtue i pulled out of my pocket the gipsy letter  but i said  before i shewed it to him  i have this letter  sir  to shew you  as what  i believe  you will allow must have given me the greatest disturbance  but  first  as i know not who is the writer  and it seems to be in a disguised hand  i would beg it as a favour  that  if you guess who it is  which i cannot it may not turn to their prejudice  because it was written  very probably  with no other view  than to serve me he took it  and read it  and it being signed somebody  he said  yes this is indeed from somebody  and  disguised as the hand is  i know the writer  don t you see  by the setness of some of these letters  and a little secretary cut here and there  especially in that c  and that r that it is the hand of a person bred in the law way  why  pamela  said he  tis old longman s hand  an officious rascal as he is but i have done with him  o sir  said i  it would be too insolent in me to offer so much am i myself overwhelmed with your goodness  to defend any body that you are angry with  yet  sir  so far as they have incurred your displeasure for my sake  and for no other want of duty or respect  i could wish but i dare not say more but  said he  as to the letter and the information it contains  let me know  pamela  when you received this  on the friday  sir  said i  that you were gone to the wedding at stamford how could it be conveyed to you  said he  unknown to mrs  jewkes  when i gave her such a strict charge to attend you  and you had promised me  that you would not throw yourself in the way of such intelligence  for  said he  when i went to stamford  i knew  from a private intimation given me  that there would be an attempt made to see you  or give you a letter  by somebody  if not to get you away  but was not certain from what quarter  whether from my sister davers  mrs  jervis  mr  longman  or john arnold  or your father and as i was then but struggling with myself  whether to give way to my honourable inclinations  or to free you  and let you go to your father that i might avoid the danger i found myself in of the former  for i had absolutely resolved never to wound again even your ears with any proposals of a contrary nature  that was the reason i desired you to permit mrs  jewkes to be so much on her guard till i came back  when i thought i should have decided this disputed point within myself  between my pride and my inclinations this  good sir  said i  accounts well to me for your conduct in that case  and for what you said to me and mrs  jewkes on that occasion  and i see more and more how much i may depend upon your honour and goodness to me but i will tell you all the truth  and then i recounted to him the whole affair of the gipsy  and how the letter was put among the loose grass  etc  and he said  the man who thinks a thousand dragons sufficient to watch a woman  when her inclination takes a contrary bent will find all too little  and she will engage the stones in the street  or the grass in the field  to act for her  and help on her correspondence  if the mind  said he  be not engaged  i see there is hardly any confinement sufficient for the body  and you have told me a very pretty story  and  as you never gave me any reason to question your veracity  even in your severest trials  i make no doubt of the truth of what you have now mentioned  and i will  in my turn  give you such a proof of mine  that you shall find it carry a conviction with it you must know  then  my pamela  that i had actually formed such a project  so well informed was this old rascally somebody  and the time was fixed for the very person described in this letter to be here  and i had thought he should have read some part of the ceremony as little as was possible  to deceive you  in my chamber  and so i hoped to have you mine upon terms that then would have been much more agreeable to me than real matrimony  and i did not in haste intend you the mortification of being undeceived  so that we might have lived for years  perhaps  very lovingly together  and i had  at the same time  been at liberty to confirm or abrogate it as i pleased o sir  said i  i am out of breath with the thoughts of my danger  but what good angel prevented the execution of this deep laid design why  your good angel  pamela  said he  for when i began to consider that it would have made you miserable  and me not happy  that if you should have a dear little one  it would be out of my own power to legitimate it  if i should wish it to inherit my estate  and that  as i am almost the last of my family  and most of what i possess must descend to a strange line  and disagreeable and unworthy persons notwithstanding that i might  in this case  have issue of my own body when i further considered your untainted virtue  what dangers and trials you had undergone by my means  and what a world of troubles i had involved you in  only because you were beautiful and virtuous  which had excited all my passion for you  and reflected also upon your tried prudence and truth  i  though i doubted not effecting this my last plot resolved to overcome myself  and  however i might suffer in struggling with my affection for you  to part with you  rather than to betray you under so black a veil  besides  said he  i remember how much i had exclaimed against and censured an action of this kind  that had been attributed to one of the first men of the law  and of the kingdom  as he afterwards became  and that it was but treading in a path that another had marked out for me  and  as i was assured  with no great satisfaction to himself  when he came to reflect  my foolish pride was a little piqued with this  because i loved to be  if i went out of the way  my own original  as i may call it  on all these considerations it was  that i rejected this project  and sent word to the person  that i had better considered of the matter  and would not have him come  till he heard further from me  and  in this suspense i suppose  some of your confederates  pamela  for we have been a couple of plotters  though your virtue and merit have procured you faithful friends and partisans which my money and promises could hardly do  one way or other got knowledge of it  and gave you this notice  but  perhaps  it would have come too late  had not your white angel got the better of my black one and inspired me with resolutions to abandon the project  just as it was to have been put into execution  but yet i own  that  from these appearances  you were but too well justified in your fears  on this odd way of coming at this intelligence  and i have only one thing to blame you for  that though i was resolved not to hear you in your own defence yet  as you have so ready a talent at your pen  you might have cleared your part of this matter up to me by a line or two  and when i had known what seeming good grounds you had for pouring cold water on a young flame  that was just then rising to an honourable expansion  should not have imputed it  as i was apt to do  to unseasonable insult for my tenderness to you  on one hand  to perverse nicety  on the other  or to what i was most alarmed by  and concerned for  prepossession for some other person  and this would have saved us both much fatigue  i of mind you of body and  indeed  sir  said i  of mind too  and i could not better manifest this  than by the cheerfulness with which i obeyed your recalling me to your presence ay  that  my dear pamela  said he  and clasped me in his arms  was the kind  the inexpressibly kind action  that has rivetted my affections to you  and obliges me  in this free and unreserved manner  to pour my whole soul into your bosom i said  i had the less merit in this my return  because i was driven  by an irresistible impulse to it  and could not help it  if i would this  said he  and honoured me by kissing my hand  is engaging indeed  if i may hope  that my pamela s gentle inclination for her persecutor was the strongest motive to her return  and i so much value a voluntary love in the person i would wish for my wife  that i would have even prudence and interest hardly named in comparison with it  and can you return me sincerely the honest compliment i now make you in the choice i have made  it is impossible i should have any view to my interest  love  true love  is the only motive by which i am induced  and were i not what i am  could you give me the preference to any other you know in the world  notwithstanding what has passed between us  why said i  should your so much obliged pamela refuse to answer this kind question  cruel as i have thought you  and dangerous as your views to my honesty have been  you  sir  are the only person living that ever was more than indifferent to me  and before i knew this to be what i blush now to call it  i could not hate you  or wish you ill  though  from my soul  the attempts you made were shocking  and most distasteful to me i am satisfied  my pamela  said he  nor shall i want to see those papers that you have kindly written for to your father  though i still wish to see them too  for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what has passed  and to have before me the whole series of your sufferings that i may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense you for them in this manner  my dear father and mother  did your happy daughter find herself blessed by her generous master  an ample recompense for all her sufferings did i think this sweet conversation only  a hundred tender things he expressed besides  that though they never can escape my memory  yet would be too tedious to write down  oh  how i blessed god and  i hope  ever shall  for all his gracious favours to his unworthy handmaid  what a happy change is this  and who knows but my kind  my generous master  may put it in my power  when he shall see me not quite unworthy of it  to be a means  without injuring him  to dispense around me  to many persons  the happy influences of the condition to which i shall be  by his kind favour  exalted  doubly blest shall i be  in particular  if i can return the hundredth part of the obligations i owe to such honest good parents  to whose pious instructions and examples under god  i owe all my present happiness  and future prospects o the joy that fills my mind on these proud hopes  on these delightful prospects it is too mighty for me  and i must sit down to ponder all these things  and to admire and bless the goodness of that providence which has  through so many intricate mazes  made me tread the paths of innocence  and so amply rewarded me for what it has itself enabled me to do  all glory to god alone be ever given for it  by your poor enraptured daughter i will now continue my most pleasing relation as the chariot was returning home from this sweet airing  he said  from all that has passed between us in this pleasing turn  my pamela will see  and will believe  that the trials of her virtue are all over from me  but  perhaps  there will be some few yet to come of her patience and humility  for i have  at the earnest importunity of lady darnford  and her daughters  promised them a sight of my beloved girl  and so i intend to have their whole family  and lady jones  and mrs  peters s family  to dine with me once in a few days  and  since i believe you would hardly choose  at present  to grace the table on the occasion  till you can do it in your own right  i should be glad you would not refuse coming down to us if i should desire it  for i would preface our nuptials  said the dear gentleman  o what a sweet word was that with their good opinion of your merits  and to see you  and your sweet manner  will be enough for that purpose  and so  by degrees  prepare my neighbours for what is to follow  and they already have your character from me  and are disposed to admire you sir  said i  after all that has passed  i should be unworthy  if i could not say  that i can have no will but yours  and however awkwardly i shall behave in such company  weighed down with a sense of your obligations on one side  and my own unworthiness  with their observations on the other  i will not scruple to obey you i am obliged to you  pamela  said he  and pray be only dressed as you are  for since they know your condition  and i have told them the story of your present dress  and how you came by it  one of the young ladies begs it as a favour  that they may see you just as you are  and i am the rather pleased it should be so  because they will perceive you owe nothing to dress  but make a much better figure with your own native stock of loveliness  than the greatest ladies arrayed in the most splendid attire  and adorned with the most glittering jewels o sir  said i  your goodness beholds your poor servant in a light greatly beyond her merit  but it must not be expected  that others ladies especially  will look upon me with your favourable eyes  but nevertheless  i should be best pleased to wear always this humble garb till you  for your own sake  shall order it otherwise  for  oh sir  said i  i hope it will be always my pride to glory most in your goodness  and it will be a pleasure to me to shew every one  that  with respect to my happiness in this life  i am entirely the work of your bounty  and to let the world see from what a lowly original you have raised me to honours  that the greatest ladies would rejoice in admirable pamela  said he  excellent girl surely thy sentiments are superior to those of all thy sex i might have addressed a hundred fine ladies  but never  surely  could have had reason to admire one as i do you as  my dear father and mother  i repeat these generous sayings  only because they are the effect of my master s goodness  being far from presuming to think i deserve one of them  so i hope you will not attribute it to my vanity  for i do assure you  i think i ought rather to be more humble  as i am more obliged  for it must be always a sign of a poor condition  to receive obligations one cannot repay  as it is of a rich mind  when it can confer them without expecting or needing a return  it is  on one side  the state of the human creature  compared on the other  to the creator  and so  with due deference  may his beneficence be said to be godlike  and that is the highest that can be said the chariot brought us home at near the hour of two  and  blessed be god  my master is pure well  and cheerful  and that makes me hope he does not repent him of his late generous treatment of me  he handed me out of the chariot  and to the parlour  with the same goodness  that he shewed when he put me into it  before several of the servants  mrs jewkes came to inquire how he did  quite well  mrs  jewkes  said he quite well  i thank god  and this good girl  for it i am glad of it said she  but i hope you are not the worse for my care  and my doctoring of you no  but the better  mrs  jewkes  said he  you have much obliged me by both then he said  mrs  jewkes  you and i have used this good girl very hardly i was afraid  sir  said she  i should be the subject of her complaints i assure you  said he  she has not opened her lips about you  we have had a quite different subject to talk of  and i hope she will forgive us both  you especially she must  because you have done nothing but by my orders  but i only mean  that the necessary consequence of those orders has been very grievous to my pamela  and now comes our part to make her amends  if we can sir  said she  i always said to madam as she called me  that you was very good  and very forgiving  no  said he  i have been stark naught and it is she  i hope  will be very forgiving  but all this preamble is to tell you  mrs  jewkes  that now i desire you ll study to oblige her as much as to obey me  you was forced to disoblige her before  and you ll remember  that in every thing she is to be her own mistress yes  said she  and mine too  i suppose  sir  ay  said the generous gentleman  i believe it will be so in a little time then  said she i know how it will go with me  and so put her handkerchief to her eyes pamela  said my master  comfort poor mrs  jewkes this was very generous  already to seem to put her in my power  and i took her by the hand  and said  i shall never take upon me  mrs  jewkes to make a bad use of any opportunities that may be put into my hands by my generous master  nor shall i ever wish to do you any disservice  if i might  for i shall consider  that what you have done  was in obedience to a will which it will become me also to submit to and so  if the effects of our obedience may be different  yet as they proceed from one cause  that must be always reverenced by me see there  mrs  jewkes  said my master  we are both in generous hands and indeed  if pamela did not pardon you  i should think she but half forgave me  because you acted by my instructions well  said she god bless you both together  since it must be so  and i will double my diligence to oblige my lady  as i find she will soon be o my dear father and mother  now pray for me on another score  for fear i should grow too proud  and be giddy and foolish with all these promising things  so soothing to the vanity of my years and sex  but even to this hour can i pray  that god would remove from me all these delightful prospects  if they were likely so to corrupt my mind  as to make me proud and vain  and not acknowledge  with thankful humility the blessed providence which has so visibly conducted me through the dangerous paths i have trod  to this happy moment my master was pleased to say  that he thought i might as well dine with him  since he was alone  but i begged he would excuse me  for fear  as i said  such excess of goodness and condescension  all at once  should turn my head and that he would  by slower degrees  bring on my happiness  lest i should not know how to bear it persons that doubt themselves  said he  seldom do amiss  and if there was any fear of what you say  you could not have it in your thoughts for none but the presumptuous  the conceited  and the thoughtless  err capitally  but  nevertheless  said he  i have such an opinion of your prudence  that i shall generally think what you do right  because it is you that do it sir  said i  your kind expressions shall not be thrown away upon me  if i can help it  for they will task me with the care of endeavouring to deserve your good opinion  and your approbation  as the best rule of my conduct being then about to go up stairs  permit me  sir  said i  looking about me with some confusion  to see that nobody was there  thus on my knees to thank you  as i often wanted to do in the chariot  for all your goodness to me  which shall never  i hope  be cast away upon me  and so i had the boldness to kiss his hand i wonder  since  how i came to be so forward  but what could i do my poor grateful heart was like a too full river  which overflows its banks  and it carried away my fear and my shamefacedness  as that does all before it on the surface of its waters he clasped me in his arms with transport  and condescendingly kneeled by me  and kissing me  said  o my dear obliging good girl  on my knees  as you on yours  i vow to you everlasting truth and fidelity  and may god but bless us both with half the pleasures that seem to be before us  and we shall have no reason to envy the felicity of the greatest princes o sir  said i  how shall i support so much goodness  i am poor  indeed in every thing  compared to you  and how far  very far  do you  in every generous way  leave me behind you he raised me  and  as i bent towards the door  led me to the stairs foot  and  saluting me there again  left me to go up to my closet  where i threw myself on my knees in raptures of joy  and blessed that gracious god  who had thus changed my distress to happiness  and so abundantly rewarded me for all the sufferings i had passed through and oh  how light  how very light  do all those sufferings now appear  which then my repining mind made so grievous to me hence  in every state of life and in all the changes and chances of it  for the future  will i trust in providence  who knows what is best for us  and frequently turns the very evils we most dread  to be the causes of our happiness  and of our deliverance from greater my experiences  young as i am  as to this great point of reliance on god  are strong  though my judgment in general may be weak and uninformed  but you ll excuse these reflections because they are your beloved daughter s  and  so far as they are not amiss  derive themselves from the benefit of yours and my late good lady s examples and instructions i have written a vast deal in a little time  and shall only say  to conclude this delightful wednesday  that in the afternoon my good master was so well  that he rode out on horseback  and came home about nine at night  and then stepped up to me  and  seeing me with pen and ink before me in my closet  said  i come only to tell you i am very well  my pamela  and since i have a letter or two to write  i will leave you to proceed in yours  as i suppose that was your employment  for i had put by my papers at his coming up  and so he saluted me  bid me good night and went down  and i finished up to this place before i went to bed mrs  jewkes told me  if it was more agreeable to me  she would be in another room  but i said  no thank you  mrs  jewkes  pray let me have your company  and she made me a fine courtesy  and thanked me how times are altered thursday this morning my master came up to me  and talked with me on various subjects  for a good while together  in the most kind manner  among other things  he asked me  if i chose to order any new clothes against my marriage  o how my heart flutters when he mentions this subject so freely  i said  i left every thing to his good pleasure  only repeated my request  for the reasons aforegiven  that i might not be too fine he said  i think  my dear  it shall be very private  i hope you are not afraid of a sham marriage  and pray get the service by heart  that you may see nothing is omitted  i glowed between shame and delight  o how i felt my cheeks burn i said  i feared nothing  i apprehended nothing  but my own unworthiness  said he  i think it shall be done within these fourteen days  from this day  at this house  o how i trembled  but not with grief  you may believe what says my girl  have you to object against any day of the next fourteen  because my affairs require me to go to my other house  and i think not to stir from this till i am happy with you i have no will but yours  said i all glowing like the fire  as i could feel  but  sir  did you say in the house  ay  said he  for i care not how privately it be done  and it must be very public if we go to church it is a holy rite  sir  said i  and would be better  methinks  in a holy place i see said he  most kindly  my lovely maid s confusion  and your trembling tenderness shews i ought to oblige you all i may  therefore i will order my own little chapel  which has not been used for two generations  for any thing but a lumber room  because our family seldom resided here long together  to be cleared and cleaned  and got ready for the ceremony  if you dislike your own chamber or mine sir  said i  that will be better than the chamber  and i hope it will never be lumbered again  but kept to the use for which  as i presume  it has been consecrated  o yes  said he  it has been consecrated  and that several ages ago  in my great great grandfather s time  who built that and the good old house together but now  my good girl  if i do not too much add to your sweet confusion shall it be in the first seven days  or the second of this fortnight  i looked down  quite out of countenance  tell me  said he in the second  if you please  sir  said i as you please  said he most kindly  but i should thank you  pamela  if you would choose the first i d rather  sir  if you please  said i  have the second  well  said he be it so  but don t defer it till the last day of the fourteen pray sir  said i  since you embolden me to talk on this important subject  may i not send my dear father and mother word of my happiness you may  said he  but charge them to keep it secret  till you or i direct the contrary  and i told you  i would see no more of your papers  but i meant  i would not without your consent  but if you will shew them to me and now i have no other motive for my curiosity but the pleasure i take in reading what you write  i shall acknowledge it as a favour if  sir  said i  you will be pleased to let me write over again one sheet  i will  though i had relied upon your word  and not written them for your perusal  what is that  said he  though i cannot consent to it beforehand  for i more desire to see them  because they are your true sentiments at the time  and because they were not written for my perusal  sir  said i  what i am loath you should see  are very severe reflections on the letter i received by the gipsy  when i apprehended your design of the sham marriage  though there are other things i would not have you see  but that is the worst  it can t be worse  said he  my dear sauce box  than i have seen already  and i will allow your treating me in ever so black a manner  on that occasion  because it must have a very black appearance to you well  sir  said i  i think i will obey you before night  but don t alter a word  said he  i won t  sir  replied i  since you order it while we were talking  mrs  jewkes came up  and said thomas was returned  o  said my master  let him bring up the papers  for he hoped and so did i  that you had sent them by him  but it was a great balk when he came up and said  sir  mr  andrews did not care to deliver them and would have it  that his daughter was forced to write that letter to him  and  indeed  sir  said he  the old gentleman took on sadly  and would have it that his daughter was undone  or else  he said  she would not have turned back  when on her way  as i told him she did  said thomas  instead of coming to them  i began to be afraid now that all would be bad for me again well  tom  said he  don t mince the matter  tell me  before mrs andrews  what they said  why  sir  both he and goody andrews  after they had conferred together upon your letter  madam  came out  weeping bitterly  that grieved my very heart  and they said  now all was over with their poor daughter  and either she had written that letter by compulsion  or had yielded to your honour  so they said  and was  or would be ruined my master seemed vexed  as i feared  and i said  pray  sir  be so good as to excuse the fears of my honest parents  they cannot know your goodness to me and so said he  without answering me  they refused to deliver the papers  yes  and please your honour  said thomas  though i told them that you  madam  of your own accord  on a letter i had brought you  very cheerfully wrote what i carried  but the old gentleman said  why  wife there are in these papers twenty things nobody should see but ourselves and especially not the squire  o the poor girl has had so many stratagems to struggle with  and now  at last  she has met with one that has been too hard for her  and can it be possible for us to account for her setting out to come to us  and in such post haste  and  when she had got above half way  to send us this letter  and to go back again of her own accord  as you say  when we know that all her delight would have been to come to us and to escape from the perils she had been so long contending with  and then  and please your honour  he said  he could not bear this  for his daughter was ruined  to be sure  before now  and so said thomas  the good old couple sat themselves down  and  hand in hand leaning upon each other s shoulder  did nothing but lament i was piteously grieved  said he  but all i could say could not comfort them nor would they give me the papers  though i told them i should deliver them only to mrs  andrews herself  and so  and please your honour  i was forced to come away without them my good master saw me all bathed in tears at this description of your distress and fears for me  and he said  i would not have you take on so  i am not angry with your father in the main  he is a good man  and i would have you write out of hand  and it shall be sent by the post to mr  atkins  who lives within two miles of your father  and i ll enclose it in a cover of mine  in which i ll desire mr  atkins  the moment it comes to his hand  to convey it safely to your father or mother  and say nothing of their sending their papers  that it may not make them uneasy for i want not now to see them on any other score than that of mere curiosity  and that will do at any time  and so saying  he saluted me before thomas  and with his own handkerchief wiped my eyes  and said to thomas  the good old folks are not to be blamed in the main  they don t know my honourable intentions by their dear daughter  who  tom  will  in a little time  be your mistress  though i shall keep the matter private some days  and would not have it spoken of by my servants out of my house thomas said  god bless your honour  you know best  and i said  o  sir you are all goodness how kind is this  to forgive the disappointment instead of being angry  as i feared you would  thomas then withdrew  and my master said  i need not remind you of writing out of hand  to make the good folks easy  and i will leave you to yourself for that purpose only send me down such of your papers  as you are willing i should see with which i shall entertain myself for an hour or two  but  one thing added he  i forgot to tell you  the neighbouring gentry i mentioned will be here tomorrow to dine with me  and i have ordered mrs  jewkes to prepare for them  and must i  sir  said i  be shewn to them  o yes  said he  that s the chief reason of their coming  and you ll see nobody equal to yourself  don t be concerned i opened my papers  as soon as my master had left me  and laid out those beginning on the thursday morning he set out for stamford  with the morning visit he made me before i was up  and the injunctions of watchfulness  etc  to mrs  jewkes  the next day s gipsy affair  and my reflections  in which i called him truly diabolical  and was otherwise very severe  on the strong appearances the matter had then against him his return on saturday  with the dread he put me in  on the offering to search me for my papers which followed those he had got by mrs  jewkes s means  my being forced to give them up  his carriage to me after he had read them  and questions to me  his great kindness to me on seeing the dangers i had escaped and the troubles i had undergone  and how i unseasonably  in the midst of his goodness  expressed my desire of being sent to you  having the intelligence of a sham marriage  from the gipsy in my thoughts  how this enraged him  and made him turn me that very sunday out of his house  and send me on my way to you  the particulars of my journey  and my grief at parting with him  and my free acknowledgment to you  that i found  unknown to myself  i had begun to love him  and could not help it  his sending after me  to beg my return but yet generously leaving me at my liberty  when he might have forced me to return whether i was willing or not  my resolution to oblige him and fatiguing journey back  my concern for his illness on my return  his kind reception of me  and shewing me his sister davers s angry letter  against his behaviour to me  desiring him to set me free  and threatening to renounce him as a brother  if he should degrade himself by marrying me  my serious reflections on this letter  etc  all which i hope  with the others  you will shortly see  and this carried matters down to tuesday night last all that followed was so kind on his side  being our chariot conference as above  on wednesday morning  and how good he has been ever since that i thought i would go no further  for i was a little ashamed to be so very open on that tender and most grateful subject  though his great goodness to me deserves all the acknowledgments i can possibly make and when i had looked these out  i carried them down myself into the parlour to him  and said  putting them into his hands  your allowances good sir  as heretofore  and if i have been too open and free in my reflections or declarations  let my fears on one side  and my sincerity on the other  be my excuse  you are very obliging  my good girl  said he  you have nothing to apprehend from my thoughts  any more than from my actions so i went up  and wrote the letter to you  briefly acquainting you with my present happiness  and my master s goodness  and expressing the gratitude of heart  which i owe to the kindest gentleman in the world and assuring you  that i should soon have the pleasure of sending back to you  not only those papers  but all that succeeded them to this time as i know you delight to amuse yourself in your leisure hours with my scribble  and i said  carrying it down to my master  before i sealed it will you please  sir  to take the trouble of reading what i write to my dear parents  thank you  pamela  said he  and set me on his knee  while he read it  and seemed much pleased with it  and giving it me again  you are very happy  said he  my beloved girl  in your style and expressions and the affectionate things you say of me are inexpressibly obliging and again  with this kiss  said he  do i confirm for truth all that you have promised for my intentions in this letter o what halcyon days are these  god continue them a change would kill me quite he went out in his chariot in the afternoon  and in the evening returned  and sent me word  he would be glad of my company for a little walk in the garden  and down i went that very moment he came to meet me  so  says he  how does my dear girl do now whom do you think i have seen since i have been out i don t know  sir  said i why  said he  there is a turning in the road  about five miles off that goes round a meadow  that has a pleasant foot way  by the side of a little brook  and a double row of limes on each side  where now and then the gentry in the neighbourhood walk  and angle  and divert themselves i ll shew it you next opportunity and i stept out of my chariot  to walk across this meadow  and bid robin meet me with it on the further part of it  and whom should i spy there  walking  with a book in his hand  reading  but your humble servant mr  williams  don t blush  pamela  said he  as his back was towards me  i thought i would speak to the man  and  before he saw me  i said  how do you  old acquaintance  for  said he  you know we were of one college for a twelvemonth  i thought the man would have jumped into the brook  he gave such a start at hearing my voice  and seeing me poor man  said i  ay  said he  but not too much of your poor man  in that soft accent  neither  pamela said i  i am sorry my voice is so startling to you  mr  williams  what are you reading  sir  said he  and stammered with the surprise  it is the french telemachus  for i am about perfecting myself  if i can  in the french tongue thought i  i had rather so  than perfecting my pamela in it you do well  replied i don t you think that yonder cloud may give us a small shower  and it did a little begin to wet he said  he believed not much if  said i  you are for the village  i ll give you a cast  for i shall call at sir simon s in my return from the little round i am taking  he asked me if it was not too great a favour no  said i  don t talk of that  let us walk to the further opening there  and we shall meet my chariot so  pamela  continued my master  we fell into conversation as we walked he said he was very sorry he had incurred my displeasure  and the more as he had been told  by lady jones  who had it from sir simon s family that i had a more honourable view than at first was apprehended  i said  we fellows of fortune  mr  williams  take sometimes a little more liberty with the world than we ought to do  wantoning  very probably as you contemplative folks would say  in the sunbeams of a dangerous affluence  and cannot think of confining ourselves to the common paths though the safest and most eligible  after all  and you may believe i could not very well like to be supplanted in a view that lay next my heart  and that by an old acquaintance  whose good  before this affair i was studious to promote i would only say  sir  said he  that my first motive was entirely such as became my function  and  very politely  said my master  he added  and i am very sure  that however inexcusable i might seem in the progress of the matter  yourself  sir  would have been sorry to have it said  you had cast your thoughts on a person  that nobody could have wished for but yourself well  mr  williams  said i  i see you are a man of gallantry  as well as religion  but what i took most amiss was  that  if you thought me doing a wrong thing  you did not expostulate with me upon it  as your function might have allowed you to do  but immediately determined to counterplot me  and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have robbed me of  and that from my own house  but the matter is at an end  and i retain not any malice upon it  though you did not know but i might  at last  do honourably by her  as i actually intend i am sorry for myself  sir  said he  that i should so unhappily incur your displeasure  but i rejoice for her sake in your honourable intentions  give me leave only to say  that if you make miss andrews your lady  she will do credit to your choice with every body that sees her  or comes to know her  and  for person and mind both  you may challenge the county in this manner  said my master  did the parson and i confabulate  and i set him down at his lodgings in the village  but he kept your secret pamela  and would not own  that you gave any encouragement to his addresses indeed  sir  said i  he could not say that i did  and i hope you believe me  i do  i do  said he  but tis still my opinion  that if  when i saw plots set up against my plots  i had not discovered the parson as i did the correspondence between you might have gone to a length that would have put our present situation out of both our powers sir  said i  when you consider  that my utmost presumption could not make me hope for the honour you now seem to design me  that i was so hardly used  and had no prospect before me but dishonour  you will allow that i should have seemed very little in earnest in my professions of honesty  if i had not endeavoured to get away  but yet i resolved not to think of marriage  for i never saw the man i could love  till your goodness emboldened me to look up to you i should  my dear pamela  said he  make a very ill compliment to my vanity  if i did not believe you  though  at the same time  justice calls upon me to say  that it is  some things considered  beyond my merit there was a sweet  noble expression for your poor daughter  my dear father and mother and from my master too i was glad to hear this account of the interview between mr  williams and himself  but i dared not to say so  i hope in time he will be reinstated in his good graces he was so good as to tell me  he had given orders for the chapel to be cleared  o how i look forward with inward joy  yet with fear and trembling friday about twelve o clock came sir simon  and his lady and two daughters  and lady jones  and a sister in law of hers  and mr  peters  and his spouse and niece  mrs  jewkes  who is more and more obliging  was much concerned i was not dressed in some of my best clothes  and made me many compliments they all went into the garden for a walk  before dinner  and  i understood  were so impatient to see me  that my master took them into the largest alcove  after they had walked two or three turns  and stept himself to me  come  my pamela  said he  the ladies can t be satisfied without seeing you  and i desire you ll come  i said  i was ashamed  but i would obey him  said he  the two young ladies are dressed out in their best attire  but they make not such an appearance as my charming girl in this ordinary garb sir  said i  shan t i follow you thither  for i can t bear you should do me so much honour  well  said he  i ll go before you  and he bid mrs  jewkes bring a bottle of sack  and some cake  so he went down to them this alcove fronts the longest gravel walk in the garden  so that they saw me all the way i came  for a good way  and my master told me afterwards  with pleasure  all they said of me will you forgive the little vain slut  your daughter  if i tell you all as he was pleased to tell me  he said  spying me first  look  there ladies  comes my pretty rustic they all  i saw  which dashed me  stood at the windows  and in the door way  looking full at me my master told me  that lady jones said  she is a charming creature  i see that  at this distance  and sir simon  it seems  who has been a sad rake in his younger days  swore he never saw so easy an air  so fine a shape  and so graceful a presence the lady darnford said  i was a sweet girl  and mrs  peters said very handsome things  even the parson said  i should be the pride of the county  o  dear sirs  all this was owing to the light my good master s favour placed me in  which made me shine out in their eyes beyond my deserts  he said the young ladies blushed  and envied me when i came near  he saw me in a little confusion  and was so kind as to meet me  give me your hand  said he  my poor girl  you walk too fast for  indeed  i wanted to be out of their gazing  i did so  with a courtesy  and he led me up the steps of the alcove  and  in a most gentleman like manner  presented me to the ladies  and they all saluted me  and said  they hoped to be better acquainted with me  and lady darnford was pleased to say  i should be the flower of their neighbourhood  sir simon said  good neighbour  by your leave  and saluting me  added  now will i say  that i have kissed the loveliest maiden in england  but  for all this  methought i owed him a grudge for a tell tale  though all had turned out so happily  mr  peters very gravely followed his example  and said  like a bishop  god bless you fair excellence  said lady jones  pray  dear madam  sit down by me and they all sat down  but i said  i would stand  if they pleased no  pamela  said my master  pray sit down with these good ladies  my neighbours they will indulge it to you  for my sake  till they know you better  and for your own  when they are acquainted with you  sir said i  i shall be proud to deserve their indulgence they all so gazed at me  that i could not look up  for i think it is one of the distinctions of persons of condition  and well bred people  to put bashful bodies out of countenance  well  sir simon  said my master what say you now to my pretty rustic he swore a great oath  that he should better know what to say to me if he was as young as himself  lady darnford said  you will never leave  sir simon said my master  you are a little confused  my good girl  and out of breath  but i have told all my kind neighbours here a good deal of your story  and your excellence  yes  said lady darnford  my dear neighbour as i will call you  we that are here present have all heard of your uncommon story  madam  said i  you have then heard what must make your kind allowance for me very necessary  no  said mrs  peters  we have heard what will always make you valued as an honour to our sex  and as a worthy pattern for all the young ladies in the county  you are very good  madam  said i  to make me able to look up  and to be thankful for the honour you are pleased to do me mrs  jewkes came in with the canary  brought by nan  to the alcove  and some cakes on a silver salver  and i said  mrs  jewkes  let me be your assistant  i will serve the ladies with the cake  and so i took the salver  and went round to the good company with it  ending with my master  the lady jones said  she never was served with such a grace and it was giving me too much trouble  o  madam  said i  i hope my good master s favour will never make me forget  that it is my duty to wait upon his friends  master  sweet one  said sir simon  i hope you won t always call mr  b  by that name  for fear it should become a fashion for all our ladies to do the like through the county  i  sir  said i shall have many reasons to continue this style  which cannot affect your good ladies sir simon  said lady jones  you are very arch upon us but i see very well  that it will be the interest of all the gentlemen  to bring their ladies into an intimacy with one that can give them such a good example i am sure then  madam  said i  it must be after i have been polished and improved by the honour of such an example as yours they all were very good and affable  and the young lady darnford  who had wished to see me in this dress  said  i beg your pardon  dear miss as she called me  but i had heard how sweetly this garb became you  and was told the history of it  and i begged it  as a favour  that you might oblige us with your appearance in it  i am much obliged to your ladyship  said i  that your kind prescription was so agreeable to my choice  why  said she  was it your choice then i am glad of that though i am sure your person must give  and not take  ornament from any dress you are very kind  madam  said i  but there will be the less reason to fear i should forget the high obligations i should have to the kindest of gentlemen  when i can delight to shew the humble degree from which his goodness had raised me my dear pamela  said my master  if you proceed at this rate  i must insist upon your first seven days  you know what i mean  sir  said i  you are all goodness they drank a glass of sack each  and sir simon would make me do so too saying  it will be a reflection  madam  upon all the ladies  if you don t do as they  no  sir simon  said i  that can t be  because the ladies  journey hither makes a glass of canary a proper cordial for them  but i won t refuse  because i will do myself the honour of drinking good health to you  and to all this worthy company said good lady darnford  to my master  i hope  sir  we shall have mrs andrews s company at table  he said  very obligingly  madam  it is her time now  and i will leave it to her choice  if the good ladies  then will forgive me  sir  said i  i had rather be excused  they all said i must not be excused  i begged i might  your reason for it  my dear pamela  said my master  since the ladies request it  i wish you would oblige them  sir  replied i  your goodness will make me  every day worthier of the honour the ladies do me  and when i can persuade myself that i am more worthy of it than at present  i shall with great joy embrace all the opportunities they will be pleased to give me mrs  peters whispered lady jones  as my master told me afterwards  did you ever see such excellence  such prudence  and discretion  never in my life  said the other good lady  she will adorn  she was pleased to say her distinction  ay  says mrs  peters  she would adorn any station in life my good master was highly delighted  generous gentleman as he is  with the favourable opinion of the ladies  and i took the more pleasure in it  because their favour seemed to lessen the disgrace of his stooping so much beneath himself lady darnford said  we will not oppress you  though we could almost blame your too punctilious exactness  but if we excuse miss andrews from dinner  we must insist upon her company at the card table  and at a dish of tea  for we intend to pass the whole day with you  sir  as we told you  what say you to that  pamela  said my master  sir  replied i whatever you and the ladies please  i will cheerfully do  they said  i was very obliging  but sir simon rapt out an oath  and said  that they might dine together  if they would  but he would dine with me  and nobody else  for  said he  i say  sir  as parson williams said  by which i found my master had told them the story  you must not think you have chosen one that nobody can like but yourself the young ladies said  if i pleased they would take a turn about the garden with me  i answered  i would very gladly attend them  and so we three  and lady jones s sister in law  and mr  peters s niece  walked together  they were very affable  kind  and obliging  and we soon entered into a good deal of familiarity  and i found miss darnford a very agreeable person  her sister was a little more on the reserve  and i afterwards heard  that  about a year before  she would fain have had my master make his addresses to her  but though sir simon is reckoned rich  she was not thought sufficient fortune for him  and now  to have him look down so low as me  must be a sort of mortification to a poor young lady and i pitied her indeed i did i wish all young persons of my sex could be as happy as i am like to be my master told me afterwards  that i left the other ladies  and sir simon and mr  peters  full of my praises  so that they could hardly talk of any thing else  one launching out upon my complexion  another upon my eyes  my hand  and  in short  for you ll think me sadly proud  upon my whole person and behaviour  and they all magnified my readiness and obligingness in my answers  and the like  and i was glad of it  as i said  for my good master s sake  who seemed quite pleased and rejoiced god bless him for his goodness to me dinner not being ready  the young ladies proposed a tune upon the spinnet  i said  i believed it was not in tune  they said  they knew it was but a few months ago  if it is  said i  i wish i had known it though indeed  ladies  added i  since you know my story  i must own that my mind has not been long in tune  to make use of it  so they would make me play upon it  and sing to it  which i did  a song my dear good lady made me learn  and used to be pleased with  and which she brought with her from bath  and the ladies were much taken with the song  and were so kind as to approve my performance  and miss darnford was pleased to compliment me  that i had all the accomplishments of my sex  i said i had had a good lady  in my master s mother  who had spared no pains nor cost to improve me  she said  she wished mr  b  could be prevailed upon to give a ball on an approaching happy occasion  that we might have a dancing match  etc but i can t say i do  though i did not say so  for these occasions  i think  are too solemn for the principals at least of our sex  to take part in  especially if they have the same thoughts of that solemnity that i have  for  indeed  though i have before me a prospect of happiness  that may be envied by ladies of high rank  yet i must own to you  my dear parents  that i have something very awful upon my mind  when i think of the matter  and shall  more and more  as it draws nearer and nearer  this is the song                   i     go  happy paper  gently steal       and underneath her pillow lie     there  in soft dreams  my love reveal     that love which i must still conceal       and  wrapt in awful silence  die                  ii     should flames be doom d thy hapless fate       to atoms thou wouldst quickly turn     my pains may bear a longer date     for should i live  and should she hate       in endless torments i should burn                 iii     tell fair aurelia  she has charms       might in a hermit stir desire     t  attain the heav n that s in her arms     i d quit the world s alluring harms       and to a cell content  retire                  iv     of all that pleas d my ravish d eye       her beauty should supply the place     bold raphael s strokes  and titian s dye     should but in

should measure out my days       and when she slept  it should be night about four o clock my master just came up to me  and said  if you should see mr  williams below  do you think  pamela  you should not be surprised no  sir  said i  i hope not  why should i  expect  said he  a stranger then  when you come down to us in the parlour  for the ladies are preparing themselves for the card table  and they insist upon your company you have a mind sir  said i  i believe  to try all my courage  why  said he  does it want courage to see him  no  sir  said i  not at all  but i was grievously dashed to see all those strange ladies and gentlemen  and now to see mr  williams before them  as some of them refused his application for me  when i wanted to get away  it will a little shock me  to see them smile  in recollecting what has passed of that kind  well  said he guard your heart against surprises  though you shall see  when you come down  a man that i can allow you to love dearly  though hardly preferably to me this surprises me much  i am afraid he begins to be jealous of me  what will become of me  for he looked very seriously  if any turn should happen now my heart aches  i know not what s the matter  but i will go down as brisk as i can  that nothing may be imputed to me  yet i wish this mr  williams had not been there now  when they are all there because of their fleers at him and me  otherwise i should be glad to see the poor gentleman  for  indeed  i think him a good man  and he has suffered for my sake so  i am sent for down to cards  i ll go  but wish i may continue their good opinions of me  for i shall be very awkward  my master  by his serious question  and bidding me guard my heart against surprises though i should see  when i came down  a man he can allow me to love dearly  though hardly better than himself  has quite alarmed me  and made me sad i hope he loves me but whether he does or not  i am in for it now  over head and ears  i doubt  and can t help loving him  tis a folly to deny it  but to be sure i can t love any man preferably to him  i shall soon know what he means now  my dear mother  must i write to you  well might my good master say so mysteriously as he did  about guarding my heart against surprises  i never was so surprised in my life  and never could see a man i loved so dearly o my dear mother  it was my dear  dear father  and not mr williams  that was below ready to receive and to bless your daughter and both my master and he enjoined me to write how the whole matter was and what my thoughts were on this joyful occasion i will take the matter from the beginning  that providence directed his feet to this house  to this time  as i have had it from mrs  jewkes from my master  my father  the ladies  and my own heart and conduct  as far as i know of both  because they command it  and you will be pleased with my relation and so  as you know how i came by the connexion  will make one uniform relation of it it seems  then  my dear father and you were so uneasy to know the truth of the story which thomas had told you  that fearing i was betrayed  and quite undone  he got leave of absence  and set out the day after thomas was there  and so  on friday morning  he got to the neighbouring town and there he heard  that the gentry in the neighbourhood were at my master s  at a great entertainment  he put on a clean shirt and neckcloth which he brought in his pocket  at an alehouse there  and got shaved  and so  after he had eaten some bread and cheese  and drank a can of ale  he set out for my master s house  with a heavy heart dreading for me  and in much fear of being brow beaten  he had  it seems  asked  at the alehouse  what family the squire had down here  in hopes to hear something of me  and they said  a housekeeper  two maids and  at present  two coachmen  and two grooms  a footman  and a helper was that all  he said  they told him  there was a young creature there belike who was  or was to be  his mistress  or somewhat of that nature but had been his mother s waiting maid  this  he said  grieved his heart  and confirmed his fears so he went on  and about three o clock in the afternoon came to the gate  and  ringing there  sir simon s coachman went to the iron gate and he asked for the housekeeper  though  from what i had written  in his heart he could not abide her  she sent for him in  little thinking who he was  and asked him  in the little hall  what his business with her was only  madam  said he  whether i cannot speak one word with the squire  no  friend  said she  he is engaged with several gentlemen and ladies  said he  i have business with his honour of greater consequence to me than either life or death  and tears stood in his eyes at that she went into the great parlour  where my master was talking very pleasantly with the ladies  and she said  sir  here is a good tight old man  that wants to see you on business of life and death  he says and is very earnest  ay  said he  who can that be let him stay in the little hall  and i ll come to him presently  they all seemed to stare and sir simon said  no more nor less  i dare say  my good friend  but a bastard child  if it is  said lady jones  bring it in to us  i will said he mrs  jewkes tells me  my master was much surprised  when he saw who it was  and she much more  when my dear father said good god  give me patience  but  as great as you are  sir  i must ask for my child  and burst out into tears  o what trouble have i given you both  my master said  taking him by the hand  don t be uneasy  goodman andrews  your daughter is in the way to be happy this alarmed my dear father  and he said  what  then  is she dying  and trembled  he could scarce stand  my master made him sit down  and sat down by him  and said  no  god be praised  she is very well  and pray be comforted  i cannot bear to see you thus apprehensive  but she has written you a letter to assure you  that she has reason to be well satisfied  and happy ah  sir i said he  you told me once she was in london  waiting on a bishop s lady  when all the time she was a severe prisoner here well that s all over now  goodman andrews  said my master  but the times are altered  for now the sweet girl has taken me prisoner  and in a few days i shall put on the most agreeable fetters that ever man wore o  sir  said  he  you are too pleasant for my griefs  my heart s almost broke  but may i not see my poor child  you shall presently  said he for she is coming down to us  and since you won t believe me  i hope you will her i will ask you  good sir  said he  but one question till then  that i may know how to look upon her when i see her  is she honest  is she virtuous as the new born babe  mr  andrews  said my good master  and in twelve days time  i hope  will be my wife o flatter me not  good your honour  said he  it cannot be  it cannot be i fear you have deluded her with strange hopes  and would make me believe impossibilities mrs  jewkes  said he  do you tell my dear pamela s good father  when i go out  all you know concerning me  and your mistress that is to be  meantime  make much of him  and set out what you have  and make him drink a glass of what he likes best  if this be wine  added he  fill me a bumper she did so  and he took my father by the hand  and said  believe me good man  and be easy  for i can t bear to see you tortured in this cruel suspense  your dear daughter is the beloved of my soul  i am glad you are come  for you ll see us all in the same story  and here s your dame s health  and god bless you both  for being the happy means of procuring for me so great a blessing  and so he drank a bumper to this most obliging health what do i hear  it cannot surely be  said my father  and your honour is too good  i hope  to mock a poor old man this ugly story  sir  of the bishop  runs in my head but you say i shall see my dear child and i shall see her honest if not  poor as i am  i would not own her my master bid mrs  jewkes not to let me know yet  that my father was come  and went to the company  and said  i have been agreeably surprised  here is honest old goodman andrews come full of grief to see his daughter  for he fears she is seduced  and tells me  good honest man  that  poor as he is  he will not own her  if she be not virtuous o  said they all  with one voice almost  dear sir  shall we not see the good old man you have so praised for his plain good sense  and honest heart  if  said he  i thought pamela would not be too much affected with the surprise  i would make you all witness to their first interview  for never did daughter love a father  or a father a daughter  as they two do one another  miss darnford  and all the ladies  and the gentlemen too begged it might be so  but was not this very cruel  my dear mother  for well might they think i should not support myself in such an agreeable surprise he said  kindly  i have but one fear  that the dear girl may be too much affected  o  said lady darnford  we ll all help to keep up her spirits says he  i ll go up  and prepare her  but won t tell her of it  so he came up to me  as i have said  and amused me about mr  williams  to half prepare me for some surprise  though that could not have been any thing to this  and he left me  as i said  in that suspense  at his mystical words  saying  he would send to me  when they were going to cards my master went from me to my father  and asked if he had eaten any thing  no  said mrs  jewkes  the good man s heart is so full  he cannot eat  nor do any thing  till he has seen his dear daughter  that shall soon be  said my master  i will have you come in with me  for she is going to sit down with my guests  to a game at quadrille  and i will send for her down  o  sir  said my father  don t  don t let me  i am not fit to appear before your guests  let me see my daughter by myself i beseech you  said he  they all know your honest character  goodman andrews  and long to see you  for pamela s sake so he took my father by the hand  and led him in  against his will  to the company  they were all very good  my master kindly said  ladies and gentlemen  i present to you one of the honestest men in england  my good pamela s father  mr  peters went to him  and took him by the hand  and said  we are all glad to see you  sir  you are the happiest man in the world in a daughter  whom we never saw before to day  but cannot enough admire said my master  this gentleman  goodman andrews  is the minister of the parish  but is not young enough for mr  williams  this airy expression my poor father said  made him fear  for a moment  that all was a jest sir simon also took him by the hand  and said  ay  you have a sweet daughter  honesty  we are all in love with her  and the ladies came  and said very fine things  lady darnford particularly  that he might think himself the happiest man in england  in such a daughter  if and please you  madam  said he  she be but virtuous  tis all in all for all the rest is accident  but i doubt his honour has been too much upon the jest with me  no  said mrs  peters  we are all witnesses  that he intends very honourably by her it is some comfort  said he  and wiped his eyes  that such good ladies say so but i wish i could see her they would have had him sit down by them  but he would only sit behind the door  in the corner of the room  so that one could not soon see him as one came in  because the door opened against him  and hid him almost the ladies all sat down  and my master said  desire mrs  jewkes to step up  and tell mrs  andrews the ladies wait for her  so down i came miss darnford rose  and met me at the door  and said  well  miss andrews  we longed for your company  i did not see my dear father  and it seems his heart was too full to speak  and he got up  and sat down three or four times successively  unable to come to me  or to say any thing  the ladies looked that way  but i would not  supposing it was mr  williams  and they made me sit down between lady darnford and lady jones  and asked me  what we should play at  i said  at what your ladyships please  i wondered to see them smile  and look upon me  and to that corner of the room  but i was afraid of looking that way  for fear of seeing mr  williams  though my face was that way too  and the table before me said my master  did you send your letter away to the posthouse  my good girl  for your father  to be sure  sir  said i  i did not forget that i took the liberty to desire mr  thomas to carry it  what  said he  i wonder  will the good old couple say to it  o sir  said i  your goodness will be a cordial to their dear honest hearts  at that  my dear father not able to contain himself  nor yet to stir from the place  gushed out into a flood of tears  which he  good soul  had been struggling with  it seems  and cried out  o my dear child i knew the voice  and  lifting up my eyes  and seeing my father  gave a spring  overturned the table  without regard to the company  and threw myself at his feet  o my father  my father  said i  can it be is it you  yes  it is  it is o bless your happy daughter  i would have said and down i sunk my master seemed concerned i feared  said he  that the surprise would be too much for her spirits  and all the ladies ran to me  and made me drink a glass of water  and i found myself encircled in the arms of my dearest father o tell me  said i  every thing  how long have you been here  when did you come  how does my honoured mother  and half a dozen questions more  before he could answer one they permitted me to retire with my father  and then i poured forth all my vows and thanksgivings to god for this additional blessing  and confirmed all my master s goodness to his scarce believing amazement and we kneeled together  blessing god  and one another  for several ecstatic minutes and my master coming in soon after  my dear father said  o sir  what a change is this  may  god reward and bless you  both in this world and the next may god bless us all  said he  but how does my sweet girl  i have been in pain for you i am sorry i did not apprise you beforehand o sir  said i  it was you  and all you do must be good but this was a blessing so unexpected well  said he  you have given pain to all the company  they will be glad to see you  when you can  for you have spoiled all their diversion  and yet painfully delighted them at the same time  mr  andrews  added he  do you make this house your own  and the longer you stay  the more welcome you ll be  after you have a little composed yourself  my dear girl  step in to us again  i am glad to see you so well already  and so he left us see you  my dear father  said i  what goodness there is in this once naughty master  o pray for him  and pray for me  that i may deserve it how long has this happy change been wrought  my dear child o  said i several happy days i have written down every thing  and you ll see from the depth of misery  what god has done for your happy daughter blessed be his name  said he  but do you say he will marry you  can it be  that such a brave gentleman will make a lady of the child of such a poor man as i  o the divine goodness  how will your poor dear mother be able to support these happy tidings  i will set out to morrow  to acquaint her with them  for i am but half happy  till the dear good woman shares them with me to be sure  my dear child  we ought to go into some far country to hide ourselves  that we may not disgrace you by our poverty o  my dear father  said i  now you are unkind for the first time  your poverty has been my glory  and my riches  and i have nothing to brag of but that i ever thought it an honour  rather than a disgrace  because you were always so honest  that your child might well boast of such a parentage in this manner  my dear mother  did we pass the happy moments  till miss darnford came to me  and said  how do you do  dear madam  i rejoice to see you so well  pray let us have your company  and yours too  good mr andrews  taking his hand this was very obliging  i told her  and we went to the great parlour and my master took my father by the hand  and made him sit down by him and drink a glass of wine with him  mean time  i made my excuses to the ladies  as well as i could  which they readily granted me  but sir simon  after his comical manner  put his hands on my shoulders  let me see  let me see  said he  where your wings grow  for i never saw any body fly like you why  said he  you have broken lady jones s shins with the table  shew her else  madam his pleasantry made them laugh  and i said  i was very sorry for my extravagancy  and if it had not been my master s doings  i should have said  it was a fault to permit me to be surprised  and put out of myself  before such good company  they said  all was very excusable  and they were glad i suffered no more by it they were so kind as to excuse me at cards  and played by themselves and i went by my master s commands and sat on the other side  in the happiest place i ever was blest with  between two of the dearest men in the world to me  and each holding one of my hands my father  every now and then  with tears  lifting up his eyes  and saying  could i ever have hoped this i asked him  if he had been so kind as to bring the papers with him  he said  he had  and looked at me  as who should say  must i give them to you now i said  be pleased to let me have them  he pulled them from his pocket  and i stood up  and  with my best duty  gave them into my master s hands  he said  thank you  pamela  your father shall take all with him  so see what a sad fellow i have been  as well as the present happier alteration  but i must have them all again  for the writer s sake the ladies and gentlemen would make me govern the tea table  whatever i could do  and abraham attended me  to serve the company  my master and my father sat together  and drank a glass or two of wine instead of tea and sir simon joked with my master  saying  i warrant you would not be such a woman s man  as to drink tea  for ever so much  with the ladies but your time s coming  and i doubt not you ll be made as comfortable as i my master was very urgent with them to stay supper  and at last they complied  on condition that i would grace the table  as they were pleased to call it  i begged to be excused  my master said  don t be excused  pamela  since the ladies desire it  and besides  said he  we won t part with your father  and so you may as well stay with us i was in hopes my father and i might sup by ourselves  or only with mrs jewkes  and miss darnford  who is a most obliging young lady  said  we will not part with you  indeed we won t when supper was brought in  lady darnford took me by the hand  and said to my master  sir  by your leave  and would have placed me at the upper end of the table  pray  pray  madam  said i  excuse me  i cannot do it indeed i cannot  pamela  said my master  to the great delight of my good father  as i could see by his looks  oblige lady darnford  since she desires it  it is but a little before your time  you know dear  good sir  said i  pray don t command it  let me sit by my father pray  why  said sir simon  here s ado indeed  sit down at the upper end as you should do  and your father shall sit by you  there  this put my dear father upon difficulties  and my master said  come  i ll place you all  and so put lady darnford at the upper end  lady jones at her right hand  and mrs  peters on the other  and he placed me between the two young ladies  but very genteelly put miss darnford below her younger sister  saying  come  miss  i put you here  because you shall hedge in this little cuckow  for i take notice  with pleasure  of your goodness to her  and  besides  all you very young ladies should sit together this seemed to please both sisters  for had the youngest miss been put there  it might have piqued her  as matters have been formerly  to be placed below me  whereas miss darnford giving place to her youngest sister  made it less odd she should to me  especially with that handsome turn of the dear man  as if i was a cuckow  and to be hedged in my master kindly said  come  mr  andrews  you and i will sit together and so took his place at the bottom of the table  and set my father on his right hand  and sir simon would sit on his left  for  said he parson  i think the petticoats should sit together  and so do you sit down by that lady his sister  a boiled turkey standing by me  my master said  cut up that turkey  pamela  if it be not too strong work for you  that lady darnford may not have too much trouble  so i carved it in a trice  and helped the ladies  miss darnford said  i would give something to be so dexterous a carver  o madam  said i  my late good lady would always make me do these things  when she entertained her female friends  as she used to do on particular days ay  said my master  i remember my poor mother would often say  if i  or any body at table  happened to be a little out in carving  i ll send up for my pamela  to shew you how to carve  said lady jones  mrs  andrews has every accomplishment of her sex  she is quite wonderful for her years  miss darnford said  and i can tell you  madam  that she plays sweetly upon the spinnet  and sings as sweetly to it  for she has a fine voice  foolish  said sir simon  who  that hears her speak  knows not that  and who that sees her fingers  believes not that they were made to touch any key  o  parson  said he  tis well you re by  or i should have had a blush from the ladies  i hope not  sir simon  said lady jones  for a gentleman of your politeness would not say any thing that would make ladies blush no  no  said he  for the world  but if i had  it would have been  as the poet says     they blush  because they understand when the company went away  lady darnford  lady jones  and mrs  peters severally invited my master  and me with him  to their houses  and begged he would permit me  at least  to come before we left those parts and they said  we hope  when the happy knot is tied  you will induce mr b  to reside more among us  we were always glad  said lady darnford when he was here  but now shall have double reason  o what grateful things were these to the ears of my good father when the company was gone  my master asked my father  if he smoked  he answered  no  he made us both sit down by him  and said  i have been telling this sweet girl  that in fourteen days  and two of them are gone  she must fix on one to make me happy  and have left it to her to choose either one of the first or last seven  my father held up his hands  and eyes  god bless your honour  said he  is all i can say  now pamela  said my master  taking my hand  don t let a little wrong timed bashfulness take place  without any other reason  because i should be glad to go to bedfordshire as soon as i could  and i would not return till i carry my servants there a mistress  who should assist me to repair the mischiefs she has made in it i could not look up for confusion  and my father said  my dear child  i need not  i am sure  prompt your obedience in whatever will most oblige so good a gentleman  what says my pamela  said my master  she does not use to be at a loss for expressions  sir  said i  were i too sudden  it would look as if i doubted whether you would hold in your mind  and was not willing to give you time for reflection  but otherwise  to be sure i ought to resign myself implicitly to your will  said he  i want not time for reflection  for i have often told you  and that long ago  i could not live without you  and my pride of condition made me both tempt and terrify you to other terms  but your virtue was proof against all temptations  and was not to be awed by terrors  wherefore  as i could not conquer my passion for you  i corrected myself  and resolved  since you would not be mine upon my terms  you should upon your own  and now i desire you not on any other  i assure you  and i think the sooner it is done  the better  what say you  mr  andrews  sir  said he  there is so much goodness on your side  and  blessed be god  so much prudence on my daughter s  that i must be quite silent  but when it is done  i and my poor wife shall have nothing to do  but to pray for you both  and to look back  with wonder and joy  on the ways of providence this  said my master  is friday night  and suppose  my girl  it be next monday  tuesday  wednesday  or thursday morning say  my pamela will you  sir  said i  excuse me till to morrow for an answer  i will said he  and touched the bell  and called for mrs  jewkes  where  said he  does mr  andrews lie tonight  you ll take care of him  he s a very good man  and will bring a blessing upon every house he sets his foot in my dear father wept for joy  and i could not refrain keeping him company  and my master  saluting me  bid us good night  and retired  and i waited upon my dear father  and was so full of prattle  of my master s goodness  and my future prospects  that i believed afterwards i was turned all into tongue  but he indulged me  and was transported with joy  and went to bed  and dreamed of nothing but jacob s ladder  and angels ascending and descending  to bless him and his daughter saturday i arose early in the morning  but found my father was up before me  and was gone to walk in the garden  i went to him  and with what delight with what thankfulness  did we go over every scene of it  that had before been so dreadful to me  the fish pond  the back door  and every place  o what reason had we for thankfulness and gratitude about seven o clock my good master joined us  in his morning gown and slippers  and looking a little heavy  i said  sir  i fear you had not good rest last night  that is your fault  pamela  said he  after i went from you  i must needs look into your papers  and could not leave them till i had read them through  and so twas three o clock before i went to sleep  i wish  sir  said i  you had had better entertainment  the worst part of it  said he  was what i had brought upon myself  and you have not spared me  sir  said i he interrupting me  said  well  i forgive you  you had too much reason for it  but i find  plainly enough that if you had got away  you would soon have been williams s wife  and i can t see how it could well have been otherwise  indeed  sir  said i i had no notion of it  or of being any body s  i believe so  said he but it must have come as a thing of course  and i see your father was for it  sir  said he  i little thought of the honour your goodness would confer upon her  and i thought that would be a match above what we could do for her  a great deal  but when i found she was not for it  i resolved not to urge her  but leave all to her own prudence i see  said he  all was sincere  honest  and open  and i speak of it  if it had been done  as a thing that could hardly well be avoided  and i am quite satisfied  but  said he  i must observe  as i have a hundred times  with admiration  what a prodigious memory  and easy and happy manner of narration  this excellent girl has  and though she is full of her pretty tricks and artifices  to escape the snares i had laid for her  yet all is innocent  lovely  and uniformly beautiful  you are exceedingly happy in a daughter  and i hope i shall be so in a wife or said my father  may she not have that honour  i fear it not  said he and i hope i shall deserve it of her but  pamela  said my master  i am sorry to find in some parts of your journal  that mrs  jewkes carried her orders a little too far  and i the more take notice of it  because you have not complained to me of her behaviour  as she might have expected for some parts of it  though a good deal was occasioned by my strict orders but she had the insolence to strike my girl  i find  sir  said i  i was a little provoking  i believe  but as we forgave one another  i was the less entitled to complain of her well  said he  you are very good  but if you have any particular resentment  i will indulge it so far  as that she shall hereafter have nothing to do where you are  sir  said i  you are so kind  that i ought to forgive every body  and when i see that my happiness is brought about by the very means that i thought then my greatest grievance  i ought to bless those means  and forgive all that was disagreeable to me at the same time  for the great good that hath issued from it that  said he and kissed me  is sweetly considered  and it shall be my part to make you amends for what you have suffered  that you may still think lighter of the one  and have cause to rejoice in the other my dear father s heart was full  and he said  with his hands folded  and lifted up  pray  sir  let me go let me go to my dear wife  and tell her all these blessed things  while my heart holds  for it is ready to burst with joy  good man  said my master i hope to hear this honest heart of yours speaking at your lips  i enjoin you  pamela  to continue your relation  as you have opportunity  and though your father be here write to your mother  that this wondrous story be perfect  and we  your friends  may read and admire you more and more  ay  pray  pray do  my child  said my father  and this is the reason that i write on  my dear mother  when i thought not to do it  because my father could tell you all that passed while he was here my master took notice of my psalm  and was pleased to commend it  and said  that i had very charitably turned the last verses  which  in the original  were full of heavy curses  to a wish that shewed i was not of an implacable disposition though my then usage might have excused it  if i had  but  said he  i think you shall sing it to me to morrow after we have breakfasted  added he  if you have no objection  pamela we ll take an airing together  and it shall be in the coach  because we ll have your father s company  he would have excused himself  but my master would have it so  but he was much ashamed  because of the meanness of his appearance my master would make us both breakfast with him on chocolate  and he said  i would have you  pamela  begin to dress as you used to do  for now  at least  you may call your two other bundles your own  and if you want any thing against the approaching occasion  private as i design it  i ll send to lincoln for it  by a special messenger  i said  my good lady s bounty  and his own  had set me much above my degree  and i had very good things of all sorts  and i did not desire any other  because i would not excite the censure of the ladies  that would be a different thing  he was pleased to say  when he publicly owned his nuptials  after we came to the other house  but  at present  if i was satisfied  he would not make words with me i hope  mr  andrews  said he  to my father  you ll not leave us till you see the affair over  and then you ll be sure i mean honourably  and besides  pamela will be induced to set the day sooner  o  sir  said he i bless god i have no reason to doubt your meaning honourably  and i hope you ll excuse me  if i set out on monday morning  very early  to my dear wife  and make her as happy as i am why  pamela  says my good master  may it not be performed on tuesday and then your father  maybe  will stay i should have been glad to have had it to morrow  added he  but i have sent monsieur colbrand for a license  that  you may have no scruple unanswered  and he can t very well be back before to morrow night  or monday morning this was most agreeable news  i said  sir  i know my dear father will want to be at home  and as you was so good to give me a fortnight from last thursday  i should be glad you would be pleased to indulge me still to some day in the second seven well  said he  i will not be too urgent  but the sooner you fix the better  mr  andrews  we must leave something to these jephthah s daughters  in these cases  he was pleased to say  i suppose the little bashful folly  which  in the happiest circumstances  may give a kind of regret to quit the maiden state  and an awkwardness at the entrance into a new one  is a reason with pamela  and so she shall name her day  sir said he  you are all goodness i went up soon after  and new dressed myself  taking possession  in a happy moment  i hope  of my two bundles  as my good master was pleased to call them  alluding to my former division of those good things my lady and himself bestowed upon me  and so put on fine linen  silk shoes  and fine white cotton stockings  a fine quilted coat  a delicate green mantea silk gown and coat  a french necklace  and a laced cambric handkerchief  and clean gloves  and  taking my fan in my hand  i  like a little proud hussy  looked in the glass  and thought myself a gentlewoman once more  but i forgot not to return due thanks  for being able to put on this dress with so much comfort mrs  jewkes would help to dress me  and complimented me highly  saying among other things  that now i looked like a lady indeed  and as  she said  the little chapel was ready  and divine service would be read in it to morrow  she wished the happy knot might then be tied  said she have you not seen the chapel  madam  since it has been cleaned out  no said i  but are we to have service in it to morrow  do you say i am glad of that  for i have been a sad heathen lately  sore against my will but who is to officiate somebody  replied she  mr  peters will send  you tell me very good news  said i  mrs  jewkes  i hope it will never be a lumber room again ay  said she  i can tell you more good news  for the two misses darnford  and lady jones  are to be here at the opening of it  and will stay and dine with you  my master  said i  has not told me that  you must alter your style  madam  said she  it must not be master now  sure o  returned i  this is a language i shall never forget  he shall always be my master  and i shall think myself more and more his servant my poor father did not know i went up to dress myself  and he said his heart misgave him when he saw me first  for fear i was made a fool of and that here was some fine lady that was to be my master s true wife and he stood in admiration  and said  o  my dear child  how well will you become your happy condition  why you look like a lady already  i hope  my dear father  said i  and boldly kissed him  i shall always be your dutiful daughter  whatever my condition be my master sent me word he was ready  and when he saw me  said  dress as you will  pamela  you re a charming girl  and so handed me to the coach  and would make my father and me sit both on the foreside  and sat backwards  over against me  and bid the coachman drive to the meadow that is  where he once met mr  williams the conversation was most agreeable to me  and to my dear father  as we went  and he more and more exceeded in goodness and generosity  and while i was gone up to dress  he had presented my father with twenty guineas  desiring him to buy himself and my mother such apparel as they should think proper  and lay it all out  but i knew not this till after we came home  my father having had no opportunity to tell me of it he was pleased to inform me of the chapel being got in tolerable order and said  it looked very well  and against he came down next  it should be all new white washed  and painted and lined  and a new pulpit cloth cushion  desk  etc  and that it should always be kept in order for the future  he told me the two misses darnford  and lady jones  would dine with him on sunday  and  with their servants and mine  said he  we shall make a tolerable congregation  and  added he  have i not well contrived to shew you that the chapel is really a little house of god  and has been consecrated  before we solemnize our nuptials in it o  sir replied i  your goodness to me is inexpressible  mr  peters  said he offered to come and officiate in it  but would not stay to dine with me  because he has company at his own house  and so i intend that divine service shall be performed in it by one to whom i shall make some yearly allowance  as a sort of chaplain you look serious  pamela  added he i know you think of your friend williams  indeed  sir  said i  if you won t be angry  i did  poor man  i am sorry i have been the cause of his disobliging you when we came to the meadow  where the gentry have their walk sometimes the coach stopt  and my master alighted  and led me to the brook side and it is a very pretty summer walk  he asked my father  if he chose to walk out  or go on in the coach to the farther end  he  poor man  chose to go on in the coach  for fear  he said  any gentry should be walking there  and he told me  he was most of the way upon his knees in the coach  thanking god for his gracious mercies and goodness  and begging a blessing upon my good master and me i was quite astonished  when we came into the shady walk  to see mr williams there  see there  said my master  there s poor williams taking his solitary walk again  with his book  and  it seems  it was so contrived  for mr  peters had been  as i since find  desired to tell him to be in that walk at such an hour in the morning so  old acquaintance  said my master  again have i met you in this place  what book are you now reading  he said  it was boileau s lutrin said my master  you see i have brought with me my little fugitive that would have been  while you are perfecting yourself in french  i am trying to learn english  and hope soon to be master of it mine  sir  said he  is a very beautiful piece of french  but your english has no equal you are very polite  mr  williams  said my master  and he that does not think as you do  deserves no share in her  why  pamela  added he  very generously  why so strange  where you have once been so familiar  i do assure you both  that i mean not  by this interview  to insult mr williams  or confound you  then i said  mr  williams  i am very glad to see you well  and though the generous favour of my good master has happily changed the scene  since you and i last saw one another  i am nevertheless very glad of an opportunity to acknowledge  with gratitude your good intentions  not so much to serve me  as me  but as a person that then had great reason to believe herself in distress  and i hope  sir  added i  to my master  your goodness will permit me to say this you  pamela  said he  may make what acknowledgments you please to mr williams s good intentions  and i would have you speak as you think but i do not apprehend myself to be quite so much obliged to those intentions sir  said mr  williams  i beg leave to say  i knew well  that  by education  you was no libertine  nor had i reason to think you so by inclination  and  when you came to reflect  i hoped you would not be displeased with me  and this was no small motive to me  at first  to do as i did ay  but mr  williams  said my master  could you think i should have had reason to thank you  if  loving one person above all her sex  you had robbed me of her  and married her yourself and then  said he  you are to consider  that she was an old acquaintance of mine  and a quite new one to you  that i had sent her down to my own house  for better securing her  and that you  who had access to my house  could not effect your purpose  without being guilty  in some sort  of a breach of the laws of hospitality and friendship  as to my designs upon her  i own they had not the best appearance  but still i was not answerable to mr williams for those  much less could you be excused to invade a property so very dear to me  and to endeavour to gain an interest in her affections  when you could not be certain that matters would not turn out as they have actually done i own  said he  that some parts of my conduct seem exceptionable  as you state it  but  sir  i am but a young man  i meant no harm  i had no interest  i am sure  to incur your displeasure  and when you think of every thing  and the inimitable graces of person  and perfections of mind  that adorn this excellent lady  so he called me  you will perhaps  find your generosity allow something as an extenuation of a fault  which your anger would not permit as an excuse i have done  said my master  nor did i meet you here to be angry with you  pamela knew not that she should see you  and now you are both present  i would ask you  mr  williams  if  now you know my honourable designs towards this good girl  you can really be almost  i will not say quite  as well pleased with the friendship of my wife  as you could be with the favour of mrs  andrews sir  said he  i will answer you truly  i think i could have preferred with her  any condition that could have befallen me  had i considered only myself  but  sir  i was very far from having any encouragement to expect her favour  and i had much more reason to believe  that  if she could have hoped for your goodness  her heart would have been too much pre engaged to think of any body else  and give me leave further to say  sir  that  though i tell you sincerely my thoughts  were i only to consider myself  yet  when i consider her good  and her merit  i should be highly ungenerous  were it put to my choice  if i could not wish her in a condition so much superior to what i could raise her to  and so very answerable to her merit pamela  said my master  you are obliged to mr  williams  and ought to thank him  he has distinguished well  but  as for me  who had like to have lost you by his means  i am glad the matter was not left to his choice  mr  williams  added he  i give you pamela s hand  because i know it will be pleasing to her  in token of her friendship and esteem for you  and i give you mine  that i will not be your enemy  but yet i must say  that i think i owe this proper manner of your thinking more to your disappointment  than to the generosity you talk of mr  williams kissed my hand  as my master gave it him  and my master said  sir  you will go home and dine with me  and i ll shew you my little chapel  and do you  pamela  look upon yourself at liberty to number mr  williams in the list of your friends how generous  how noble  was this  mr  williams and so had i  had tears of pleasure in his eyes  i was silent  but mr  williams said  sir  i shall be taught  by your generosity  to think myself inexcusably wrong in every step i took  that could give you offence  and my future life shall shew my respectful gratitude we walked on till we came to the coach  where was my dear father pamela  said my master  tell mr  williams who that good man is  o  mr williams  said i  it is my dear father  and my master was pleased to say  one of the honestest men in england  pamela owes every thing that she is to be  as well as her being  to him  for  i think  she would not have brought me to this  nor made so great resistance  but for the good lessons  and religious education  she had imbibed from him mr  williams said  taking father s hand  you see  good mr  andrews  with inexpressible pleasure  no doubt  the fruits of your pious care  and now are in a way  with your beloved daughter  to reap the happy effects of it i am overcome  said my dear father  with his honour s goodness  but i can only say  i bless god  and bless him mr  williams and i being nearer the coach than my master  and he offering to draw back  to give way to him  he kindly said  pray  mr williams  oblige pamela with your hand  and step in yourself  he bowed and took my hand  and my master made him step in  and sit next me  all that ever he could do  and sat himself over against him  next my father who sat against me and he said  mr  andrews  i told you yesterday that the divine you saw was not mr  williams  i now tell you  this gentleman is  and though i have been telling him  i think not myself obliged to his intentions  yet i will own that pamela and you are  and though i won t promise to love him  i would have you sir  said mr  williams  you have a way of overcoming  that hardly all my reading affords an instance of  and it is the more noble  as it is on this side  as i presume  the happy ceremony  which  great as your fortune is  will lay you under an obligation to so much virtue and beauty  when the lady becomes yours  for you will then have a treasure that princes might envy you said my generous master  god bless him  mr  williams  it is impossible that you and i should long live at variance  when our sentiments agree so well together  on subjects the most material i was quite confounded  and my master  seeing it  took my hand  and said  look up  my good girl  and collect yourself don t injure mr williams and me so much  as to think we are capping compliments  as we used to do verses at school  i dare answer for us both  that we say not a syllable we don t think o sir  said i  how unequal am i to all this goodness  every moment that passes adds to the weight of the obligations you oppress me with think not too much of that  said he most generously  mr  williams s compliments to you have great advantage of mine  for  though equally sincere  i have a great deal to say  and to do  to compensate the sufferings i have made you undergo  and  at last  must sit down dissatisfied  because those will never be balanced by all i can do for you he saw my dear father quite unable to support these affecting instances of his goodness and he let go my hand  and took his  and said  seeing his tears  i wonder not  my dear pamela s father  that your honest heart springs thus to your eyes  to see all her trials at an end  i will not pretend to say  that i had formerly either power or will to act thus but since i began to resolve on the change you see  i have reaped so much pleasure in it  that my own interest will keep me steady  for  till within these few days  i knew not what it was to be happy poor mr  williams  with tears of joy in his eyes  said  how happily sir  have you been touched by the divine grace  before you have been hurried into the commission of sins  that the deepest penitence could hardly have atoned for god has enabled you to stop short of the evil and you have nothing to do  but to rejoice in the good  which now will be doubly so  because you can receive it without the least inward reproach you do well  said he  to remind me  that i owe all this to the grace of god  i bless him for it  and i thank this good man for his excellent lessons to his daughter  i thank her for following them  and i hope from her good example  and your friendship  mr  williams  in time  to be half as good as my tutoress  and that  said he  i believe you ll own will make me  without disparagement to any man  the best fox hunter in england mr  williams was going to speak  and he said  you put on so grave a look  mr  williams  that  i believe  what i have said  with you practical good folks  is liable to exception  but i see we are become quite grave  and we must not be too serious neither what a happy creature  my dear mother  is your pamela o may my thankful heart  and the good use i may be enabled to make of the blessings before me  be a means to continue this delightful prospect to a long date  for the sake of the dear good gentleman  who thus becomes the happy instrument  in the hand of providence  to bless all he smiles upon  to be sure  i shall never enough acknowledge the value he is pleased to express for my unworthiness  in that he has prevented my wishes  and  unasked  sought the occasion of being reconciled to a good man  who  for my sake  had incurred his displeasure  and whose name he could not  a few days before  permit to pass through my lips  but see the wonderful ways of providence  the very things that i most dreaded his seeing or knowing  the contents of my papers  have  as i hope satisfied all his scruples  and been a means to promote my happiness henceforth let not us poor short sighted mortals pretend to rely on our own wisdom  or vainly think  that we are absolutely to direct for ourselves  i have abundant reason  i am sure  to say  that  when i was most disappointed  i was nearer my happiness  for had i made my escape which was so often my chief point in view  and what i had placed my heart upon  i had escaped the blessings now before me  and fallen perhaps headlong  into the miseries i would have avoided  and yet  after all  it was necessary i should take the steps i did  to bring on this wonderful turn  o the unsearchable wisdom of god and how much ought i to adore the divine goodness  and humble myself  who am made a poor instrument  as i hope  not only to magnify his graciousness to this fine gentleman and myself  but also to dispense benefits to others  which god of his mercy grant in the agreeable manner i have mentioned  did we pass the time in our second happy tour  and i thought mrs  jewkes would have sunk into the ground  when she saw mr  williams brought in the coach with us  and treated so kindly  we dined together in a most pleasant  easy  and frank manner  and i found i need not  from my master s generosity  to be under any restraint  as to my conduct to this good clergyman  for he  so often as he fancied i was reserved  moved me to be free with him  and to him and several times called upon me to help my father and mr  williams  and seemed to take great delight in seeing me carve  as  indeed  he does in every thing i do after dinner we went and looked into the chapel  which is a very pretty one  and very decent  and  when finished as he designs it  against his next coming down  will be a very pretty place my heart  my dear mother  when i first set my foot in it  throbbed a good deal  with awful joy  at the thoughts of the solemnity  which  i hope  will in a few days be performed here  and when i came up towards the little pretty altar piece  while they were looking at a communion picture  and saying it was prettily done  i gently stept into a corner  out of sight  and poured out my soul to god on my knees  in supplication and thankfulness  that  after having been so long absent from divine service  the first time i entered into a house dedicated to his honour  should be with such blessed prospects before me  and begging of god to continue me humble  and to make me not unworthy of his mercies  and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my happiness  my good master i heard my master say  where s pamela  and so i broke off sooner than i would  and went up to him he said  mr  williams  i hope i have not so offended you by my conduct past  for really it is what i ought to be ashamed of  as that you will refuse to officiate  and to give us your instructions here to morrow mr  peters was so kind  for the first time  to offer it  but i knew it would be inconvenient for him  and  besides  i was willing to make this request to you an introduction to our reconciliation sir  said he  most willingly  and most gratefully  will i obey you though  if you expect a discourse  i am wholly unprepared for the occasion  i would not have it  replied he  pointed to any particular occasion  but if you have one upon the text there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth  than over ninety nine just persons that need no repentance  and if it makes me not such a sad fellow as to be pointed at by mine and the ladies  servants we shall have here  i shall be well content  tis a general subject  added he  makes me speak of that  but any one you please will do  for you cannot make a bad choice i am sure sir  said he  i have one upon that text  but i am ready to think  that a thanksgiving one  which i made on a great mercy to myself  if i may be permitted to make my own acknowledgments of your favour the subject of a discourse  will be suitable to my grateful sentiments  it is on the text now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation that text  said i  will be a very suitable one for me  not so  pamela said my master  because i don t let you depart in peace  but i hope you will stay here with content o but  sir  said i  i have seen god s salvation i am sure  added i if any body ever had reason  i have to say  with the blessed virgin  my soul doth magnify the lord  for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden and exalted one of low degree said my good father  i am sure  if there were time for it  the book of ruth would afford a fine subject for the honour done my dear child why  good mr  andrews  said my master  should you say so i know that story  and mr  williams will confirm what i say  that my good girl here will confer at least as much honour as she will receive sir  said i  you are inexpressibly generous  but i shall never think so why  my pamela  said he  that s another thing  it will be best for me to think you will  and it will be kind in you to think you shan t  and then we shall always have an excellent rule to regulate our conduct by to one another was not this finely  nobly  wisely said  my dear mother o what a blessed thing it is to be matched to a man of sense and generosity how edifying  how but what shall i say i am at loss for words mr  williams said  when we came out of the little chapel  he would go home  and look over his discourses  for one for the next day  my master said  i have one thing to say before you go when my jealousy  on account of this good girl  put me upon such a vindictive conduct to you you know i took a bond for the money i had caused you to be troubled for  i really am ashamed of the matter  because i never intended  when i presented it to you  to have it again  you may be sure  but i knew not what might happen between you and her  nor how far matters might have gone between you  and so i was willing to have that in awe over you  and i think it is no extraordinary present  therefore  to give you up your bond again cancelled  and so he took it from his pocket  and gave it him  i think  added he  all the charges attending it  and the trouble you had  were defrayed by my attorney  i ordered that they should  they were  sir  said he  and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness and the kind manner in which you do it if you will go  mr  williams said he  shall my chariot carry you home  no  sir  answered he  i thank you  my time will be so well employed all the way  in thinking of your favours  that i choose to meditate upon them  as i walk home my dear father was a little uneasy about his habit  for appearing at chapel next day  because of misses darnford and the servants  for fear poor man  he should disgrace my master  and he told me  when he was mentioning this  of my master s kind present of twenty guineas for clothes  for you both  which made my heart truly joyful  but oh  to be sure  i can never deserve the hundredth part of his goodness it is almost a hard thing to be under the weight of such deep obligations on one side  and such a sense of one s own unworthiness on the other o what a godlike power is that of doing good i envy the rich and the great for nothing else my master coming to us just then  i said  oh  sir  will your bounty know no limits  my dear father has told me what you have given him a trifle  pamela  said he  a little earnest only of my kindness say no more of it  but did i not hear the good man expressing some sort of concern for somewhat  hide nothing from me  pamela  only  sir  said i he knew not how to absent himself from divine service  and yet is afraid of disgracing you by appearing fie  mr  andrews  said he  i thought you knew that the outward appearance was nothing  i wish i had as good a habit inwardly as you have  but i ll tell you  pamela  your father is not so much thinner than i am  nor much shorter  he and i will walk up together to my wardrobe though it is not so well stored here  as in bedfordshire and so  said he  pleasantly  don t you pretend to come near us  till i call for you  for you must not yet see how men dress and undress themselves  o sir  said my father  i beg to be excused  i am sorry you were told  so am not i  said my master  pray come along with me he carried him up stairs  and shewed him several suits  and would have had him take his choice  my poor father was quite confounded  for my master saw not any he thought too good  and my father none that he thought bad enough  and my good master  at last  he fixed his eye upon a fine drab  which he thought looked the plainest  would help him to try the coat and waistcoat on himself  and  indeed  one would not have thought it  because my master is taller  and rather plumper  as i thought but  as i saw afterwards  they fitted him very well  and being plain  and lined with the same colour  and made for travelling in a coach  pleased my poor father much  he gave him the whole suit  and calling up mrs  jewkes  said  let these clothes be well aired against tomorrow morning  mr  andrews brought only with him his common apparel not thinking to stay sunday with us  and pray see for some of my stockings  and whether any of my shoes will fit him  and see also for some of my linen  for we have put the good man quite out of his course by keeping him sunday over  he was then pleased to give him the silver buckles out of his own shoes  so  my good mother  you must expect to see my dear father a great beau  wig  said my master  he wants none  for his own venerable white locks are better than all the perukes in england but i am sure i have hats enough somewhere i ll take care of every thing  sir  said mrs  jewkes and my poor father  when he came to me  could not refrain tears  i know not how  said he  to comport myself under these great favours  o my child  it is all owing to the divine goodness  and your virtue sunday this blessed day all the family seemed to take delight to equip themselves for the celebration of the sabbath in the little chapel and lady jones and mr  williams came in her chariot  and the two misses darnford in their own  and we breakfasted together in a most agreeable manner  my dear father appeared quite spruce and neat  and was quite caressed by the three ladies  as we were at breakfast  my master told mr  williams  we must let the psalms alone  he doubted  for want of a clerk  but mr  williams said  no  nothing should be wanting that he could supply  my father said  if it might be permitted him  he would  as well as he was able  perform that office  for it was always what he had taken delight in  and as i knew he had learnt psalmody formerly  in his youth  and had constantly practised it in private  at home  on sunday evenings  as well as endeavoured to teach it in the little school he so unsuccessfully set up  at the beginning of his misfortunes  before he took to hard labour  i was in no pain for his undertaking it in this little congregation  they seemed much pleased with this  and so we went to chapel  and made a pretty tolerable appearance  mrs  jewkes  and all the servants  attending  but the cook  and i never saw divine service performed with more solemnity  nor assisted at with greater devotion and decency  my master  lady jones  and the two misses  setting a lovely example my good father performed his part with great applause  making the responses  as if he had been a practised parish clerk  and giving the xxiiid psalm     the lord is only my support        and he that doth me feed      how can i then lack any thing        whereof i stand in need      in pastures green he feedeth me        where i do safely lie      and after leads me to the streams        which run most pleasantly      and when i find myself near lost        then home he doth me take      conducting me in his right paths        e en for his own name s sake      and tho  i were e en at death s door        yet would i fear no ill      for both thy rod and shepherd s crook        afford me comfort still      thou hast my table richly spread        in presence of my foe      thou hast my head with balm refresh d        my cup doth overflow      and finally  while breath doth last        thy grace shall me defend      and in the house of god will i        my life for ever spend which consisted of but three staves  we had it all  and he read the line  and began the tune with a heart so entirely affected with the duty  that he went through it distinctly  calmly  and fervently at the same time  so that lady jones whispered me  that good man were fit for all companies  and present to every laudable occasion  and miss darnford said  god bless the dear good man you must think how i rejoiced in my mind i know  my dear mother  you can say most of the shortest psalms by heart  so i need not transcribe it  especially as your chief treasure is a bible  and a worthy treasure it is  i know nobody makes more or better use of it mr  williams gave us an excellent discourse on liberality and generosity  and the blessings attending the right use of riches  from the xith chapter of proverbs  ver    there is that scattereth  and yet increaseth  and there is that withholdeth more than is meet  but it tendeth to poverty  the liberal soul shall be made fat  and he that watereth  shall be watered also himself  and he treated the subject in so handsome a manner  that my master s delicacy  who  at first  was afraid of some personal compliments  was not offended  mr  williams judiciously keeping to generals  and it was an elegant and sensible discourse  as my master said my father was in the clerk s place  just under the desk  and lady jones by her footman  whispered him to favour us with another psalm  when the sermon was ended  he thinking  as he said afterwards  that the former was rather of the longest  chose the shortest in the book  which you know is the cxviith     o all ye nations of the world        praise ye the lord always      and all ye people every where        set forth his noble praise      for great his kindness is to us        his truth doth not decay      wherefore praise ye the lord our god        praise ye the lord alway my master thanked mr  williams for his excellent discourse  and so did the ladies  as also did i most heartily  and he was pleased to take my dear father by the hand  as did also mr  williams  and thanked him the ladies  likewise  made him their compliments  and the servants all looked upon him with countenances of respect and pleasure at dinner  do what i could  i was forced to take the upper end of the table  and my master sat at the lower end  between mr  williams and my father  and he said  pamela  you are so dexterous  that i think you may help the ladies yourself  and i will help my two good friends  i should have told you  though  that i dressed myself in a flowered satin  that was my lady s  and looked quite fresh and good  and which was given me at first  by my master  and the ladies  who had not seen me out of my homespun before  made me abundance of fine compliments  as soon as they saw me first talking of the psalms just after dinner  my master was very naughty if i may so say  for he said to my father  mr  andrews  i think in the afternoon  as we shall have only prayers  we may have one longer psalm and what think you of the cxxxviith  o  good sir  said i  pray  pray not a word more  say what you will  pamela  said he  you shall sing it to us  according to your on version  before these good ladies go away my father smiled  but was half concerned for me  and said  will it bear and please your honour o ay  said he  never fear it  so long as mrs jewkes is not in the hearing this excited all the ladies  curiosity  and lady jones said  she would be loath to desire to hear any thing that would give me concern  but should be glad i would give leave for it  indeed  madam  said i  i must beg you won t insist upon it  i cannot bear it you shall see it  indeed  ladies  said my master  and pray  pamela  not always as you please  neither then  pray sir  said i  not in my hearing  i hope sure  pamela  returned he  you would not write what is not fit to be heard but  sir  said i  there are particular cases  times  and occasions  that may make a thing passable at one time  that would not be tolerable at another  o  said he  let me judge of that  as well as you pamela  these ladies know a good part of your story  and  let me tell you  what they know is more to your credit than mine  so that if i have no averseness to reviving the occasion  you may very well bear it  said he  i will put you out of your pain  pamela  here it is  and took it out of his pocket i stood up  and said  indeed  sir  i can t bear it  i hope you ll allow me to leave the room a minute  if you will read it  indeed but i won t answered he  lady jones said  pray  good sir  don t let us hear it  if mrs  andrews be so unwilling  well  pamela  said my master  i will put it to your choice  whether i shall read it now  or you will sing it by and by  that s very hard  sir  said i  it must be one  i assure you said he  why then  sir  replied i  you must do as you please  for i cannot sing it well  then  said my master  i find i must read it  and yet  added he after all  i had as well let it alone  for it is no great reputation to myself  o then  said miss darnford  pray let us hear it  to choose why then  proceeded he  the case was this  pamela  i find  when she was in the time of her confinement  that is  added he  when she was taken prisoner  in order to make me one  for that is the upshot of the matter  in the journal she kept  which was intended for nobody s perusal but her parents  tells them  that she was importuned  one sunday  by mrs  jewkes  to sing a psalm  but her spirits not permitting she declined it  but after mrs  jewkes was gone down  she says  she recollected  that the cxxxviith psalm was applicable to her own case mrs  jewkes having often  on other days  in vain  besought her to sing a song  that thereupon she turned it more to her own supposed case  and believing mrs  jewkes had a design against her honour  and looking upon her as her gaoler  she thus gives her version of this psalm  but pray mr  williams  do you read one verse of the common translation  and i will read one of pamela s  then mr  williams  pulling out his little pocket common prayer book  read the first two stanzas                  i     when we did sit in babylon       the rivers round about     then in remembrance of sion       the tears for grief burst out                 ii     we hang d our harps and instruments       the willow trees upon     for in that place  men  for that use       had planted many a one my master then read                  i     when sad i sat in b n hall       all guarded round about     and thought of ev ry absent friend       the tears for grief burst out                 ii     my joys and hopes all overthrown       my heart strings almost broke     unfit my mind for melody       much more to bear a joke the ladies said  it was very pretty  and miss darnford  that somebody else had more need to be concerned than the versifier i knew  said my master  i should get no credit by shewing this  but let us read on  mr  williams  so mr  williams read                iii     then they  to whom we pris ners were       said to us  tauntingly     now let us hear your hebrew songs       and pleasant melody now this  said my master  is very near  and read                iii     then she  to whom i prisoner was       said to me tauntingly     now cheer your heart  and sing a song       and tune your mind to joy mighty sweet  said mr  williams  but let us see how the next verse is turned  it is this                 iv     alas  said we  who can once frame       his heavy heart to sing     the praises of our living god       thus under a strange king why  said my master  it is turned with beautiful simplicity  thus                 iv     alas  said i  how can i frame       my heavy heart to sing     or tune my mind  while thus enthrall d       by such a wicked thing very pretty  said mr  williams  lady jones said  o  dear madam  could you wish that we should be deprived of this new instance of your genius and accomplishments o  said my dear father  you will make my good child proud  no  said my master very generously  pamela can t be proud  for no one is proud to hear themselves praised  but those who are not used to it but proceed mr  williams  he read                  v     but yet  if i jerusalem       out of my heart let slide     then let my fingers quite forget       the warbling harp to guide well  now  said my master  for pamela s version                  v     but yet  if from my innocence       i ev n in thought should slide     then let my fingers quite forget       the sweet spinnet to guide mr  williams read                 vi     and let my tongue  within my mouth       be ty d for ever fast     if i rejoice  before i see       thy full deliv rance past this  also  said my master  is very near                 vi     and let my tongue  within my mouth       be lock d for ever fast     if i rejoice  before i see       my full deliv rance past now  good sir  said i  oblige me  don t read any further  pray don t  o pray  madam  said mr  williams  let me beg to have the rest read  for i long to know whom you make the sons of edom  and how you turn the psalmist s execrations against the insulting babylonians well  mr  williams  replied i  you should not have said so  o  said my master  that is one of the best things of all  poor mrs  jewkes stands for edom s sons  and we must not lose this  because i think it one of my pamela s excellencies  that  though thus oppressed  she prays for no harm upon the oppressor  read  mr  williams  the next stanza  so he read                vii     therefore  o lord  remember now       the cursed noise and cry     that edom s sons against us made       when they ras d our city               viii     remember  lord  their cruel words       when  with a mighty sound     they cried  down  yea down with it       unto the very ground well  said my master  here seems  in what i am going to read  a little bit of a curse indeed  but i think it makes no ill figure in the comparison                vii     and thou  almighty  recompense       the evils i endure     from those who seek my sad disgrace       so causeless  to procure and now  said he  for edom s sons  though a little severe in the imputation               viii     remember  lord  this mrs  jewkes       when with a mighty sound     she cries  down with her chastity       down to the very ground sure  sir  said i  this might have been spared  but the ladies and mr williams said  no  by no means  and i see the poor wicked woman has no favourers among them now  said my master  read the psalmist s heavy curses  and mr  williams read                 ix     ev n so shalt thou  o babylon       at length to dust be brought     and happy shall that man be call d       that our revenge hath wrought                  x     yea  blessed shall the man be call d       that takes thy little ones     and dasheth them in pieces small       against the very stones thus he said  very kindly  has my pamela turned these lines                 ix     ev n so shalt thou  o wicked one       at length to shame be brought     and happy shall all those be call d       that my deliv rance wrought                  x     yea  blessed shall the man be call d       that shames thee of thy evil     and saves me from thy vile attempts       and thee  too  from the d l i fancy this blessed man  said my master smiling  was  at that time hoped to be you  mr  williams  if the truth was known  sir  said he whoever it was intended for then  it can be nobody but your good self now i could hardly hold up my head for the praises the kind ladies were pleased to heap upon me  i am sure  by this  they are very partial in my favour  all because my master is so good to me  and loves to hear me praised  for i see no such excellence in these lines  as they would make me believe  besides what is borrowed from the psalmist we all  as before  and the cook maid too  attended the prayers of the church in the afternoon  and my dear father concluded with the following stanzas of the cxlvth psalm  suitably magnifying the holy name of god for all mercies  but did not observe  altogether  the method in which they stand  which was the less necessary  he thought  as he gave out the lines     the lord is just in all his ways       his works are holy all     and he is near all those that do       in truth upon him call     he the desires of all them       that fear him  will fulfil     and he will hear them when they cry       and save them all he will     the eyes of all do wait on thee       thou dost them all relieve     and thou to each sufficient food       in season due  dost give     thou openest thy plenteous hand       and bounteously dost fill     all things whatever  that do live       with gifts of thy good will     my thankful mouth shall gladly speak       the praises of the lord     all flesh  to praise his holy name       for ever shall accord we walked in the garden till tea was ready  and as he went by the back door  my master said to me  of all the flowers in the garden  the sun flower is the fairest o  sir  said i  let that be now forgot mr  williams heard him say so  and seemed a little out of countenance whereupon my master said  i mean not to make you serious  mr  williams but we see how strangely things are brought about  i see other scenes hereabouts  that  in my pamela s dangers  give me more cause of concern than any thing you ever did should give you  sir  said he  you are very generous my master and mr  williams afterwards walked together for a quarter of an hour  and talked about general things  and some scholastic subjects and joined us  very well pleased with one another s conversation lady jones said  putting herself on one side of me  as my master was on the other  but pray  sir  when is the happy time to be  we want it over that we may have you with us as long afterwards as you can  said my master  i would have it to morrow  or next day at farthest  if pamela will  for i have sent for a license  and the messenger will be here to night  or early in the morning  i hope  but  added he  pray  pamela do not take beyond thursday  she was pleased to say  sure it will not be delayed by you  madam  more than needs well  said he  now you are on my side  i will leave you with her to settle it  and  i hope  she will not let little bashful niceties be important with her  and so he joined the two misses lady jones told me  i was to blame  she would take upon her to say  if i delayed it a moment  because she understood lady davers was very uneasy at the prospect  that it would be so  and if any thing should happen  it would be a sad thing madam  said i  when he was pleased to mention it to me first  he said it should be in fourteen days  and afterwards asked me if i would have it in the first or the second seven  i answered for how could i do otherwise in the second  he desired it might not be the last day of the second seven  now  madam  said i  as he was then pleased to speak his mind  no doubt  i would not  for any thing  seem too forward well  but  said she  as he now urges you in so genteel and gentlemanly a manner for a shorter day  i think  if i was in your place  i would agree to it  she saw me hesitate and blush  and said  well  you know best  but i say only what i would do  i said  i would consider of it  and if i saw he was very earnest  to be sure i should think i ought to oblige him misses darnford were begging to be at the wedding  and to have a ball and they said  pray  mrs  andrews  second our requests  and we shall be greatly obliged to you  indeed  ladies  said i  i cannot promise that if i might why so  said they because  answered i i know not what but i think one may  with pleasure  celebrate an anniversary of one s nuptials  but the day itself indeed  ladies  i think it is too solemn a business  for the parties of our sex to be very gay upon  it is a quite serious and awful affair  and i am sure  in your own cases  you would be of my mind  why  then  said miss darnford  the more need one has to be as light hearted and merry as one can i told you  said my master  what sort of an answer you d have from pamela  the younger miss said  she never heard of such grave folks in her life  on such an occasion  why  sir  said she  i hope you ll sing psalms all day  and miss will fast and pray  such sackcloth and ashes doings  for a wedding  did i never hear of she spoke a little spitefully  i thought  and i returned no answer  i shall have enough to do  i reckon  in a while  if i am to answer every one that will envy me we went in to tea  and all that the ladies could prevail upon my master for  was a dancing match before he left this county  but miss darnford said  it should then be at their house  for  truly  if she might not be at the wedding  she would be affronted  and come no more hither  till we had been there when they were gone  my master would have had my father stay till the affair was over  but he begged he might set out as soon as it was light in the morning  for  he said  my mother would be doubly uneasy at his stay  and he burned with impatience to let her know all the happy things that had befallen her daughter  when my master found him so desirous to go  he called mr  thomas  and ordered him to get a particular bay horse ready betimes in the morning  for my father  and a portmanteau  to put his things in  and to attend him a day s journey  and if  said he  mr andrews chooses it  see him safe to his own home  and  added he  since that horse will serve you  mr  andrews  to ride backwards and forwards to see us  when we go into bedfordshire  i make you a present of it with the accoutrements  and  seeing my father going to speak  he added i won t be said nay  o how good was this he also said a great many kind things at supper time  and gave him all the papers he had of mine  but desired  when he and my mother had read them  that he would return them to him again  and then he said  so affectionate a father and daughter may  perhaps  be glad to be alone together  therefore remember me to your good wife  and tell her  it will not be long  i hope  before i see you together  on a visit to your daughter  at my other house  and so i wish you good night  and a good journey  if you go before i see you  and then he shook hands  and left my dear father almost unable to speak  through the sense of his favours and goodness you may believe  my dear mother  how loath i was to part with my good father  and he was also unwilling to part with me  but he was so impatient to see you  and tell you the blessed tidings  with which his heart overflowed  that i could hardly wish to detain him mrs  jewkes brought two bottles of cherry brandy  and two of cinnamon water  and some cake  and they were put up in the portmanteau with my father s newly presented clothes  for he said  he would not for any thing  be seen in them in his neighbourhood  till i was actually known  by every body  to be married  nor would he lay out any part of the twenty guineas till then neither  for fear of reflections  and then he would consult me as to what he would buy  well  said i  as you please  my dear father  and i hope now we shall often have the pleasure of hearing from one another  without needing any art or contrivances he said  he would go to bed betimes  that he might be up as soon as it was light  and so he took leave of me  and said  he would not love me if i got up in the morning to see him go  which would but make us both loath to part  and grieve us both all day mr  thomas brought him a pair of boots  and told him  he would call him up at peep of day  and put up every thing over night  and so i received his blessing  and his prayers  and his kind promises of procuring the same from you  my dear mother  and went up to my closet with a heavy heart  and yet a half pleased one  if i may so say  for that  as he must go  he was going to the best of wives  and with the best of tidings but i begged he would not work so hard as he had done  for i was sure my master would not have given him twenty guineas for clothes  if he had not designed to do something else for him  and that he should be the less concerned at receiving benefits  from my good master  because he who had so many persons to employ in his large possessions  could make him serviceable  to a degree equivalent  without hurting any body else he promised me fair  and  pray  dear mother  see he performs  i hope my master will not see this  for i will not send it you  at present  till i can send you the best of news  and the rather  as my dear father can supply the greatest part of what i have written  since the papers he carries you  by his own observation  so good night  my dear mother  and god send my father a safe journey  and a happy meeting to you both monday mr  colbrand being returned  my master came up to me to my closet  and brought me the license  o how my heart fluttered at the sight of it now  pamela  said he  tell me  if you can oblige me with the day  your word is all that s wanting  i made bold to kiss his dear hand  and though unable to look up  said i know not what to say  sir  to all your goodness  i would not  for any consideration  that you should believe me capable of receiving negligently an honour  that all the duty of a long life  were it to be lent me  will not be sufficient to enable me to be grateful for  i ought to resign myself  in every thing i may or can  implicitly to your will  but but what  said he  with a kind impatience why  sir  said i  when from last thursday you mentioned four days  i had reason to think that term your choice  and my heart is so wholly yours  that i am afraid of nothing  but that i may be forwarder than you wish  impossible  my dear creature  said he  and folded me in his arms  impossible  if this be all  it shall be set about this moment  and this happy day shall make you mine i ll send away instantly  said the dear gentleman  and was going i said  no  pray  sir  pray  sir  hear me indeed it cannot be to day cannot  said he no  indeed  sir  said i and was ready to sink to see his generous impatience  why flattered you then my fond heart  replied he  with the hope that it might sir  said i  i will tell you what i had thought  if you ll vouchsafe me your attention  do then  said he i have  sir  proceeded i  a great desire  that  whenever the day is it may be on a thursday  on a thursday my dear father and mother were married  and  though poor  they are a very happy pair on a thursday your poor pamela was born  on a thursday my dear good lady took me from my parents into her protection  on a thursday  sir  you caused me to be carried away to this place  to which i now  by god s goodness  and your favour  owe so amazingly all my present prospects  and on a thursday it was  you named to me  that fourteen days from that you would confirm my happiness  now  sir  if you please to indulge my superstitious folly you will greatly oblige me  i was sorry  sir  for this reason  when you bid me not defer till the last day of the fourteen  that thursday in next week was that last day this  pamela  is a little superstitious  i must needs say  and i think you should begin now to make another day in the week a happy one  as for example  on a monday  may you say  my father and mother concluded to be married on the thursday following  on a monday  so many years ago my mother was preparing all her matters to be brought to bed on the thursday following  on a monday  several weeks ago  it was that you had but two days more to stay  till you was carried away on thursday  on a monday  i myself  said he  well remember  it was that i wrote you the letter  that prevailed on you so kindly to return to me  and on the same day you did return to my house here  which i hope  my girl  will be as propitious an era as any you have named  and now  lastly  will you say which will crown the work  and  on a monday i was married come  come my dear  added he  thursday has reigned long enough o conscience  let us now set monday in its place  or at least on an equality with it  since you see it has a very good title  and as we now stand in the week before us  claims priority  and then  i hope  we shall make tuesday  wednesday friday  saturday  and sunday  as happy days as monday and thursday  and so  by god s blessing  move round  as the days move  in a delightful circle  till we are at a loss what day to prefer to the rest o how charmingly was this said and how sweetly kind indeed  sir  said i  you rally my folly very agreeably  but don t let a little matter stand in the way  when you are so generously obliging in a greater  indeed i like thursday best  if i may choose well  then  said he  if you can say you have a better reason than this i will oblige you  else i ll send away for the parson this moment and so  i protest  he was going dear sirs  how i trembled  stay  stay sir  said i  we have a great deal to say first  i have a deal of silly prate to trouble you with well  say then  in a minute  replied he  the most material  for all we have to say may be talked of while the parson is coming o  but indeed  and indeed  said i  it cannot be to day well  then  shall it be to morrow  said he why  sir  if it must not be on a thursday  you have given so many pleasant distinctions for a monday  that let it then be next monday what  a week still  said he  sir  answered i  if you please  for that will be  as you enjoined within the second seven days  why  girl  said he  twill be seven months till next monday  let it  said he  if not to morrow  be on wednesday  i protest i will stay no longer then  sir  returned i  please to defer it  however  for one day more and it will be my beloved thursday  if i consent to defer it till then may i hope  my pamela  said he  that next thursday shall certainly be the happy day yes  sir  said i and i am sure i looked very foolishly and yet  my dear father and mother  why should i  with such a fine gentleman  and whom i so dearly love  and so much to my honour too but there is something greatly awful upon my mind  in the solemn circumstance  and a change of condition never to be recalled  though all the prospects are so desirable  and i can but wonder at the thoughtless precipitancy with which most young folks run into this important change of life so now  my dear parents  have i been brought to fix so near a day as next thursday  and this is monday  o dear  it makes one out of breath almost to think of it  this  though  was a great cut off  a whole week out of ten days  i hope i am not too forward  i m sure  if it obliges my dear master  i am justified  for he deserves of me all things in my poor power after this  he rode out on horseback  attended by abraham  and did not return till night  how by degrees things steal upon one  i thought even this small absence tedious  and the more  as we expected him home to dinner i wish i may not be too fond  and make him indifferent  but yet  my dear father and mother  you were always fond of one another  and never indifferent  let the world run as it would when he returned  he said  he had had a pleasant ride  and was led out to a greater distance than he intended  at supper he told me  that he had a great mind mr  williams should marry us  because  he said  it would shew a thorough reconciliation on his part  but  said he  most generously  i am apprehensive  from what passed between you  that the poor man will take it hardly  and as a sort of insult  which i am not capable of  what says my girl do you think he would  i hope not  sir said i  as to what he may think  i can t answer  but as to any reason for his thoughts  i can  for indeed  sir  said i  you have been already so generous  that he cannot  i think  mistake your goodness he then spoke with some resentment of lady davers s behaviour  and i asked  if any thing new had occurred  yes  said he  i have had a letter delivered me from her impertinent husband  professedly at her instigation  that amounted to little less than a piece of insolent bravery  on supposing i was about to marry you  i was so provoked added he  that after i had read it  i tore it in a hundred pieces  and scattered them in the air  and bid the man who brought it let his master know what i had done with his letter  and so would not permit him to speak to me  as he would fain have done i think the fellow talked somewhat of his lady coming hither  but she shall not set her foot within my doors  and i suppose this treatment will hinder her i was much concerned at this  and he said  had i a hundred sisters pamela  their opposition should have no weight with me  and i did not intend you should know it  but you can t but expect a little difficulty from the pride of my sister  who have suffered so much from that of her brother  and we are too nearly allied in mind  as well as blood  i find but this is not her business  and if she would have made it so she should have done it with more decency  little occasion had she to boast of her birth  that knows not what belongs to good manners i said  i am very sorry  sir  to be the unhappy occasion of a misunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister  don t say so  pamela  because this is an unavoidable consequence of the happy prospect before us  only bear it well yourself  because she is my sister  and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own rashness if  sir  said i  the most lowly behaviour  and humble deportment  and in every thing shewing a dutiful regard to good lady davers  will have any weight with her ladyship  assure yourself of all in my power to mollify her  no  pamela  returned he  don t imagine  when you are my wife  i will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character  i know the duty of a husband  and will protect your gentleness to the utmost  as much as if you were a princess by descent you are inexpressibly good  sir  said i  but i am far from taking a gentle disposition to shew a meanness of spirit  and this is a trial i ought to expect  and well i may bear it  that have so many benefits to set against it  which all spring from the same cause well  said he  all the matter shall be this  we will talk of our marriage as a thing to be done next week  i find i have spies upon me wherever i go  and whatever i do  but now  i am on so laudable a pursuit  that i value them not  nor those who employ them  i have already ordered my servants to have no conference with any body for ten or twelve days to come  and mrs  jewkes tells me every one names thursday come se nnight for our nuptials  so i will get mr  peters  who wants to see my little chapel  to assist mr  williams  under the notion of breakfasting with me next thursday morning  since you won t have it sooner  and there will nobody else be wanting  and i will beg of mr peters to keep it private  even from his own family  for a few days  has my girl any objection o  sir  answered i  you are so generous in all your ways  i can have no objections but i hope lady davers and you will not proceed to irreconcilable lengths  and when her ladyship comes to see you  and to tarry with you  two or three weeks  as she used to do  i will keep close up  so as not to disgust her with the sight of me well  pamela  said he  we will talk of that afterwards  you must do then as i shall think fit  and i shall be able to judge what both you and i ought to do  but what still aggravates the matter is  that she should instigate the titled ape her husband to write to me  after she had so little succeeded herself  i wish i had kept his letter  that i might have shewn you how a man  that generally acts like a fool  can take upon him to write like a lord  but i suppose it is of my sister s penning and he  poor man  is the humble copier tuesday mr  thomas is returned from you  my dear father  with the good news of your health  and your proceeding in your journey to my dear mother where i hope to hear soon you are arrived  my master has just now been making me play upon the spinnet  and sing to it  and was pleased to commend me for both  but he does so for every thing i do  so partial does his goodness make him to me one o clock we are just returned from an airing in the chariot  and i have been delighted with his conversation upon english authors  poets particularly  he entertained me also with a description of some of the curiosities he had seen in italy and france  when he made what the polite world call the grand tour  he said he wanted to be at his other seat  for he knew not well how to employ himself here  having not proposed to stay half the time  and when i get there  pamela  said he you will hardly be troubled with so much of my company  after we have settled  for i have a great many things to adjust  and i must go to london  for i have accounts that have run on longer than ordinary with my banker there  and i don t know  added he  but the ensuing winter i may give you a little taste of the diversions of the town for a month or so  i said  his will and pleasure should determine mine  and i never would  as near as i could  have a desire after those  or any other entertainments that were not in his own choice he was pleased to say  i make no doubt but that i shall be very happy in you  and hope you will be so in me  for  said he  i have no very enormous vices to gratify  though i pretend not to the greatest purity neither  my girl  sir  said i  if you can account to your own mind i shall always be easy in whatever you do  but our greatest happiness here  sir  continued i  is of very short duration  and this life  at the longest  is a poor transitory one  and i hope we shall be so happy as to be enabled to look forward  with comfort  to another  where our pleasures will be everlasting you say well  pamela  and i shall  by degrees  be more habituated to this way of thinking  as i more and more converse with you  but  at present  you must not be over serious with me all at once  though i charge you never forbear to mingle your sweet divinity in our conversation  whenever it can be brought in a propos  and with such a cheerfulness of temper  as shall not throw a gloomy cloud over our innocent enjoyments i was abashed at this  and silent  fearing i had offended  but he said if you attend rightly to what i said  i need not tell you again  pamela not to be discouraged from suggesting to me  on every proper occasion the pious impulses of your own amiable mind  sir  said i  you will be always indulgent  i make no doubt  to my imperfections  so long as i mean well my master made me dine with him  and would eat nothing but what i helped him to  and my heart is  every hour  more and more enlarged with his goodness and condescension  but still  what ails me  i wonder  a strange sort of weight hangs upon my mind  as thursday draws on  which makes me often sigh involuntarily  and damps  at times  the pleasures of my delightful prospects i hope this is not ominous  but only the foolish weakness of an over thoughtful mind  on an occasion the most solemn and important of one s life  next to the last scene  which shuts up all i could be very serious  but i will commit all my ways to that blessed providence  which hitherto has so wonderfully conducted me through real evils to this hopeful situation i only fear  and surely i have great reason  that i shall be too unworthy to hold the affections of so dear a gentleman god teach me humility  and to know my own demerit  and this will be  next to his grace  my surest guard  in the state of life to which  though most unworthy  i am going to be exalted  and don t cease your prayers for me  my dear parents  for  perhaps  this new condition may be subject to still worse hazards than those i have escaped  as would be the case were conceitedness  vanity  and pride  to take hold of my frail heart and if i was  for my sins  to be left to my own conduct  a frail bark in a tempestuous ocean  without ballast  or other pilot than my own inconsiderate will  but my master said  on another occasion  that those who doubted most  always erred least  and i hope i shall always doubt my own strength  my own worthiness i will not trouble you with twenty sweet agreeable things that passed in conversation with my excellent benefactor  nor with the civilities of m  colbrand  mrs  jewkes  and all the servants  who seem to be highly pleased with me  and with my conduct to them  and as my master hitherto  finds no fault that i go too low  nor they that i carry it too high  i hope i shall continue to have every body s good will  but yet will i not seek to gain any one s by little meannesses or debasements but aim at an uniform and regular conduct  willing to conceal involuntary errors  as i would have my own forgiven  and not too industrious to discover real ones  or to hide such  if any such should appear  as might encourage bad hearts  or unclean hands  in material cases  where my master should receive damage  or where the morals of the transgressors should appear wilfully and habitually corrupt  in short  i will endeavour  as much as i can  that good servants shall find in me a kind encourager  indifferent ones be made better  by inspiring them with a laudable emulation  and bad ones  if not too bad in nature  and quite irreclaimable  reformed by kindness  expostulation  and even proper menaces  if necessary  but most by a good example  all this if god pleases wednesday now  my dear parents  i have but this one day between me and the most solemn rite that can be performed  my heart cannot yet shake off this heavy weight  sure i am ungrateful to the divine goodness  and the favour of the best of benefactors yet i hope i am not for  at times my mind is all exultation  with the prospect of what good to morrow s happy solemnity may possibly  by the leave of my generous master  put it in my power to do  o how shall i find words to express  as i ought  my thankfulness  for all the mercies before me wednesday evening my dear master is all love and tenderness  he sees my weakness  and generously pities and comforts me  i begged to be excused supper  but he brought me down himself from my closet  and placed me by him  bidding abraham not wait  i could not eat  and yet i tried  for fear he should be angry  he kindly forbore to hint any thing of the dreadful  yet delightful to morrow  and put  now and then  a little bit on my plate and guided it to my mouth  i was concerned to receive his goodness with so ill a grace  well  said he  if you won t eat with me  drink at least with me  i drank two glasses by his over persuasions  and said  i am really ashamed of myself  why  indeed  said he  my dear girl  i am not a very dreadful enemy  i hope  i cannot bear any thing that is the least concerning to you  oh  sir  said i  all is owing to the sense i have of my own unworthiness to be sure  it cannot be any thing else he rung for the things to be taken away  and then reached a chair and sat down by me  and put his kind arms about me  and said the most generous and affecting things that ever dropt from the honey flowing mouth of love  all i have not time to repeat  some i will  and oh indulge your foolish daughter  who troubles you with her weak nonsense because what she has to say  is so affecting to her  and because  if she went to bed  instead of scribbling  she could not sleep this sweet confusion and thoughtfulness in my beloved pamela  said the kind man  on the near approach of our happy union  when i hope all doubts are cleared up  and nothing of dishonour is apprehended  shew me most abundantly  what a wretch i was to attempt such purity with a worse intention no wonder  that one so virtuous should find herself deserted of life itself on a violence so dreadful to her honour  and seek a refuge in the shadow of death but now  my dearest pamela  that you have seen a purity on my side  as nearly imitating your own  as our sex can shew to yours  and since i have  all the day long  suppressed even the least intimation of the coming days  that i might not alarm your tender mind  why all this concern  why all this affecting  yet sweet confusion  you have a generous friend  my dear girl  in me  a protector now  not a violator of your innocence  why then  once more i ask  this strange perplexity  this sweet confusion o sir  said i  and hid my face on his arm  expect not reason from a foolish creature  you should have still indulged me in my closet  i am ready to beat myself for this ungrateful return to your goodness  but i know not what i am  to be sure  a silly creature  o had you but suffered me to stay by myself above  i should have made myself ashamed of so culpable a behaviour but goodness added to goodness every moment  and the sense of my own unworthiness  quite overcome my spirits now  said the generous man  will i  though reluctantly  make a proposal to my sweet girl if i have been too pressing for the day  if another day will still be more obliging  if you have fears you will not then have  you shall say but the word  and i ll submit  yes  my pamela  for though i have  these three days past  thought every tedious hour a day till thursday comes  if you earnestly desire it  i will postpone it say  my dear girl  freely say  but accept not my proposal  without great reason  which yet i will not ask for sir  said i  i can expect nothing but superlative goodness  i have been so long used to it from you  this is a most generous instance of it  but i fear yes  i fear it will be too much the same thing  some days hence when the happy  yet  fool that i am  dreaded time  shall be equally near kind  lovely charmer  said he  now do i see you are to be trusted with power  from the generous use you make of it not one offensive word or look  from me  shall wound your nicest thoughts  but pray try to subdue this over scrupulousness  and unseasonable timidity  i persuade myself you will if you can indeed  sir  i will  said i  for i am quite ashamed of myself  with all these lovely views before me the honours you do me  the kindness you shew me i cannot forgive myself  for  oh  if i know the least of this idle foolish heart of mine  it has not a misgiving thought of your goodness  and i should abhor it  if it were capable of the least affectation but  dear good sir  leave me a little to myself  and i will take myself to a severer task than your goodness will let you do and i will present my heart before you  a worthier offering to you  than at present its wayward follies will let it seem to be but one thing is  one has no kind friend of one s own sex  to communicate one s foolish thoughts to  and to be strengthened by their comfortings  but i am left to myself  and  oh  what a weak silly thing i am he kindly withdrew  to give me time to recollect myself  and in about half an hour returned  and then  that he might not begin at once upon the subject  and say  at the same time  something agreeable to me  said your father and mother have had a great deal of talk by this time about you  pamela  o  sir  returned i  your goodness has made them quite happy  but i can t help being concerned about lady davers he said  i am vexed i did not hear the footman out  because it runs in my head he talked somewhat about her coming hither  she will meet with but an indifferent reception from me  unless she comes resolved to behave better than she writes pray  sir  said i  be pleased to bear with my good lady  for two reasons  what are they  said he  why  first  sir  answered i  because she is your sister  and  to be sure  may very well think  what all the world will  that you have much undervalued yourself in making me happy and next  because  if her ladyship finds you out of temper with her  it will still aggravate her more against me  and every time that any warm words you may have between you  come into her mind  she will disdain me more don t concern yourself about it  said he  for we have more proud ladies than she in our other neighbourhood  who  perhaps  have still less reason to be punctilious about their descent  and yet will form themselves upon her example  and say  why  his own sister will not forgive him  nor visit him  and so  if i can subdue her spirit  which is more than her husband ever could  or indeed any body else  it is a great point gained  and  if she gives me reason  i ll try for it  i assure you well  but  my dear girl  continued he  since the subject is so important  may i not say one word about to morrow sir  said i  i hope i shall be less a fool  i have talked as harshly to my heart  as lady davers can do  and the naughty thing suggests to me a better  and more grateful behaviour he smiled  and  kissing me  said  i took notice  pamela  of what you observed  that you have none of your own sex with you  i think it is a little hard upon you  and i should have liked you should have had miss darnford  but then her sister must have been asked  and i might as well make a public wedding  which  you know  would have required clothes and other preparations  besides  added he  a foolish proposal was once made me of that second sister  who has two or three thousand pounds more than the other  left her by a godmother  and she can t help being a little piqued  though  said he  it was a proposal they could not expect should succeed  for there is nothing in her person nor mind  and her fortune as that must have been the only inducement  would not do by any means and so i discouraged it at once i am thinking  sir  said i  of another mortifying thing too  that were you to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to your own  all the eve to the day would be taken up in reading  signing  and sealing of settlements  and portion  and such like  but now the poor pamela brings you nothing at all  and the very clothes she wears  so very low is she are entirely the effects of your bounty  and that of your good mother this makes me a little sad  for  alas  sir  i am so much oppressed by your favours  and the sense of the obligations i lie under  that i cannot look up with the confidence that i otherwise should  on this awful occasion there is  my dear pamela  said he  where the power is wanting  as much generosity in the will as in the action  to all that know your story and your merit  it will appear that i cannot recompense you for what i have made you suffer  you have had too many hard struggles and exercises  and have nobly overcome  and who shall grudge you the reward of the hard bought victory this affair is so much the act of my own will  that i glory in being capable of distinguishing so much excellence  and my fortune is the more pleasurable to me  as it gives me hope  that i may make you some part of satisfaction for what you have undergone this  sir  said i  is all goodness  unmerited on my side  and makes my obligations the greater  i can only wish for more worthiness but how poor is it to offer nothing but words for such generous deeds and to say  i wish for what is a wish  but the acknowledged want of power to oblige  and a demonstration of one s poverty in every thing but will and that  my dear girl  said he  is every thing  tis all i want  tis all that heaven itself requires of us  but no more of these little doubts  though they are the natural impulses of a generous and grateful heart  i want not to be employed in settlements  those are for such to regard  who make convenience and fortune the prime considerations  i have possessions ample enough for us both  and you deserve to share them with me  and you shall do it  with as little reserve  as if you had brought me what the world reckons an equivalent  for  as to my own opinion  you bring me what is infinitely more valuable  an experienced truth  a well tried virtue  and a wit and behaviour more than equal to the station you will be placed in  to say nothing of this sweet person that itself might captivate a monarch  and of the meekness of temper and sweetness of disposition  which make you superior to all the women i ever saw thus kind and soothing  and honourably affectionate  was the dear gentleman  to the unworthy  doubting  yet assured pamela  and thus patiently did he indulge  and generously pardon  my impertinent weakness  he offered to go himself to lady jones  in the morning  and reveal the matter to her  and desire her secrecy and presence  but i said  that would disoblige the young ladies darnford  no  sir  said i  i will cast myself upon your generous kindness  for why should i fear the kind protector of my weakness  and the guide and director of my future steps you cannot  said he  forgive mrs  jewkes  for she must know it  and suffer her to be with you  yes  sir  said i  i can  she is very civil to me now  and her former wickedness i will forgive  for the sake of the happy fruits that have attended it  and because you mention her well  said he  i will call her in  if you please as you please  sir said i  and he rung for her  and when she came in  he said  mrs  jewkes i am going to entrust you with a secret  sir  answered she  i will be sure to keep it as such  why  said he  we intend to morrow  privately as possible  for our wedding day  and mr  peters and mr  williams are to be here  as to breakfast with me  and to shew mr  peters my little chapel as soon as the ceremony is over  we will take a little airing in the chariot  as we have done at other times  and so it will not be wondered that we are dressed  and the two parsons have promised secrecy  and will go home  i believe you can t well avoid letting one of the maids into the secret  but that i ll leave to you sir  replied she  we all concluded it would be in a few days  and i doubt it won t be long a secret  no  said he  i don t desire it should but you know we are not provided for a public wedding  and i shall declare it when we go to bedfordshire  which won t be long  but the men who lie in the outhouses  need not know it  for  by some means or other my sister davers knows all that passes do you know  sir  said she  that her ladyship intends to be down here with you in a few days  her servant told me so  who brought you the letter you were angry at i hope  said he  we shall be set out for t other house first  and shall be pleased she loses her labour  sir  continued she  her ladyship proposes to be here time enough to hinder your nuptials  which she takes  as we did  will be the latter end of next week  well  said he let her come  but yet i desire not to see her mrs  jewkes said to me  give me leave  madam  to wish you all manner of happiness  but i am afraid i have too well obeyed his honour  to be forgiven by you  indeed  mrs  jewkes  returned i  you will be more your own enemy than i will be  i will look all forward  and shall not presume  so much as by a whisper  to set my good master against any one he pleases to approve of  and as to his old servants  i shall always value them  and never offer to dictate to his choice  or influence it by my own caprices mrs  jewkes  said my master  you find you have no cause to apprehend any thing  my pamela is very placable  and as we have both been sinners together  we must both be included in one act of grace such an example of condescension  as i have before me  mrs  jewkes  said i  may make you very easy  for i must be highly unworthy  if i did not forego all my little resentments  if i had any  for the sake of so much goodness to myself you are very kind  madam  said she  and you may depend upon it  i will atone for all my faults  by my future duty and respect to you  as well as to my master that s well said on both sides  said he  but  mrs  jewkes  to assure you  that my good girl here has no malice  she chooses you to attend her in the morning at the ceremony  and you must keep up her spirits i shall  replied she  be very proud of the honour  but i cannot  madam but wonder to see you so very low spirited  as you have been these two or three days past  with so much happiness before you why  mrs  jewkes  answered i  there can be but one reason given and that is  that i am a sad fool but  indeed  i am not ungrateful neither  nor would i put on a foolish affectation  but my heart  at times  sinks within me  i know not why  except at my own unworthiness and because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself under  as i should do  it is an honour  mrs  jewkes  added i  i was not born to  and no wonder  then  i behave so awkwardly  she made me a fine compliment upon it  and withdrew  repeating her promises of care secrecy  etc he parted from me with very great tenderness  and i came up and set to writing  to amuse my thoughts  and wrote thus far  and mrs  jewkes being come up  and it being past twelve  i will go to bed  but not one wink  i fear  shall i get this night i could beat myself for anger  sure there is nothing ominous in this strange folly but i suppose all young maidens are the same  so near so great a change of condition  though they carry it off more discreetly than i thursday  six o clock in the morning i might as well have not gone to bed last night  for what sleep i had mrs  jewkes often was talking to me  and said several things that would have been well enough from any body else of our sex  but the poor woman has so little purity of heart  that it is all say from her  and goes no farther than the ear i fancy my master has not slept much neither  for i heard him up  and walking about his chamber  ever since break of day  to be sure  good gentleman  he must have some concern  as well as i  for here he is going to marry a poor foolish unworthy girl  brought up on the charity  as one may say  at least bounty  of his worthy family  and this foolish girl must be  to all intents and purposes  after twelve o clock this day  as much his wife  as if he were to marry a duchess and here he must stand the shocks of common reflection  the great mr  b  has done finely  he has married his poor servant wench  will some say  the ridicule and rude jests of his equals  and companions too  he must stand  and the disdain of his relations  and indignation of lady davers  his lofty sister  dear good gentleman  he will have enough to do  to be sure  o how shall i merit all these things at his hand  i can only do the best i can  and pray to god to reward him  and resolve to love him with a pure heart and serve him with a sincere obedience  i hope the dear gentleman will continue to love me for this  for  alas  i have nothing else to offer but  as i can hardly expect so great a blessing  if i can be secure from his contempt  i shall not be unfortunate  and must bear his indifference  if his rich friends should inspire him with it  and proceed with doing my duty with cheerfulness half an hour past eight o clock my good dear master  my kind friend  my generous benefactor  my worthy protector  and  oh  all the good words in one  my affectionate husband that is soon to be be curbed in  my proud heart  know thy self  and be conscious of thy unworthiness has just left me  with the kindest tenderest expressions  and gentlest behaviour  that ever blest a happy maiden  he approached me with a sort of reined in rapture  my pamela said he  may i just ask after your employment  don t let me chide my dear girl this day  however  the two parsons will be here to breakfast with us at nine  and yet you are not a bit dressed  why this absence of mind  and sweet irresolution why  indeed  sir  said i  i will set about a reformation this instant he saw the common prayer book lying in the window  i hope  said he  my lovely maiden has been conning the lesson she is by and by to repeat have you not  pamela  and clasped his arms about me  and kissed me indeed  sir  said i  i have been reading over the solemn service and what thinks my fairest for so he called me  of it o sir  tis very awful  and makes one shudder  to reflect upon it no wonder  said he  it should affect my sweet pamela  i have been looking into it this morning  and i can t say but i think it a solemn  but very suitable service  but this i tell my dear love  continued he  and again clasped me to him  there is not a tittle in it that i cannot joyfully subscribe to  and that  my dear pamela  should make you easy  and join cheerfully in it with me  i kissed his dear hand  o my generous  kind protector said i  how gracious is it to confirm thus the doubting mind of your poor servant  which apprehends nothing so much as her own unworthiness of the honour and blessing that await her he was pleased to say  i know well  my dearest creature  that  according to the liberties we people of fortune generally give ourselves  i have promised a great deal  when i say so  but i would not have said it  if  deliberately i could not with all my heart  so banish from your mind all doubt and uneasiness  let a generous confidence in me take place  and let me see it does  by your cheerfulness in this day s solemn business  and then i will love you for ever may god almighty  sir  said i  reward all your goodness to me that is all i can say  but  oh  how kind it is in you  to supply the want of the presence and comfortings of a dear mother  of a loving sister  or of the kind companions of my own sex  which most maidens have  to soothe their anxieties on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity you  sir are all these tender relations in one to me  your condescensions and kindness shall  if possible  embolden me to look up to you without that sweet terror  that must confound poor bashful maidens  on such an occasion  when they are surrendered up to a more doubtful happiness  and to half strange men  whose good faith  and good usage of them  must be less experienced  and is all involved in the dark bosom of futurity  and only to be proved by the event this  my dear pamela  said he  is most kindly said  it shews me that you enter gratefully into my intention  for i would  by my conduct  supply all these dear relations to you  and i voluntarily promise  from my heart  to you  what i think i could not  with such assured resolutions of performance  to the highest born lady in the kingdom  for let me tell my sweet girl  that  after having been long tossed by the boisterous winds of a more culpable passion  i have now conquered it  and am not so much the victim of your beauty  all charming as you are  as of your virtue  and therefore may more boldly promise for myself  having so stable a foundation for my affection  which  should this outward beauty fail  will increase with your virtue  and shine forth the brighter as that is more illustriously displayed by the augmented opportunities which the condition you are now entering into will afford you o the dear charming man  how nobly  how encouragingly kind  was all this i could not suitably express myself  and he said  i see my girl is at a loss for words  i doubt not your kind acceptance of my declarations  and when i have acted too much the part of a libertine formerly  for you to look back without some anxiety  i ought not  being now happily convicted  to say less but why loses my girl her time  i will now only add  that i hope for many happy years to make good  by my conduct  what so willingly flows from my lips he kissed me again  and said  but  whatever you do  pamela  be cheerful for else  may be  of the small company we shall have  some one  not knowing how to account for your too nice modesty  will think there is some other person in the world  whose addresses would be still more agreeable to you this he said with an air of sweetness and pleasantry  but it alarmed me exceedingly  and made me resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as possible  for this was  indeed  a most affecting expression  and enough to make me  if any thing can  behave as i ought  and to force my idle fears to give way to hopes so much better grounded and i began almost on this occasion  to wish mr  williams were not to marry me  lest i should behave like a fool  and so be liable to an imputation  which i should be most unworthy  if i deserved so i set about dressing me instantly  and he sent mrs  jewkes to assist me  but i am never long a dressing  when i set about it  and my master has now given me a hint  that will  for half an hour more  at least keep my spirits in a brisk circulation  yet it concerns me a little too lest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt  that i am not  mind and person  entirely his and so being now ready  and not called to breakfast  i sat down and wrote thus far i might have mentioned  that i dressed myself in a rich white satin night gown  that had been my good lady s  and my best head clothes  etc i have got such a knack of writing  that when i am by myself  i cannot sit without a pen in my hand but i am now called to breakfast  i suppose the gentlemen are come now  courage  pamela  remember thou art upon thy good behaviour fie upon it  my heart begins to flutter again foolish heart  be still  never  sure  was any maiden s perverse heart under so little command as mine it gave itself away  at first without my leave  it has been  for weeks  pressing me with its wishes and yet now  when it should be happy itself  and make me so  it is throb  throb  throb  like a little fool  and filling me with such unseasonable misgivings  as abate the rising comforts of all my better prospects thursday  near three o clock i thought i should have found no time nor heart to write again this day but here are three gentlemen come  unexpectedly  to dine with my master and so i shall not appear  he has done all he could  civilly  to send them away  but they will stay  though i believe he had rather they would not  and so i have nothing to do but to write till i go to dinner myself with mrs  jewkes  for my master was not prepared for this company  and it will be a little latish to day  so i will begin with my happy story where i left off when i came down to breakfast  mr  peters and mr  williams were both there  and as soon as my master heard me coming down  he met me at the door  and led me in with great tenderness  he had kindly spoken to them as he told me afterwards  to mention no more of the matter to me  than needs must  i paid my respects to them  i believe a little awkwardly and was almost out of breath  but said  i had come down a little too fast when abraham came in to wait  my master said  that the servants should not mistrust  tis well  gentlemen  you came as you did  for my good girl and i were going to take an airing till dinner time  i hope you ll stay and dine with me  sir  said mr  peters  we won t hinder your airing  i only came  having a little time upon my hands  to see your chapel  but must be at home at dinner  and mr  williams will dine with me  well then  said my master  we will pursue our intention  and ride out for an hour or two  as soon as i have shewn mr  peters my little chapel  will you  pamela  after breakfast  walk with us to it  if if  said i  and had like to have stammered  foolish that i was  if you please  sir  i could look none of them in the face  abraham looking at me  why  child  said my master  you have hardly recovered your fright yet  how came your foot to slip  tis well you did not hurt yourself said mr  peters  improving the hint  you ha n t sprained your ancle madam  i hope  no  sir  said i  i believe not  but tis a little painful to me  and so it was  for i meant my foolishness  abraham  said my master  bid robin put the horses to the coach  instead of the chariot and if these gentlemen will go  we can set them down  no matter  sir said mr  peters  i had as lieve walk  if mr  williams chooses it  well then  said my master  let it be the chariot  as i told him i could eat nothing  though i attempted it  and my hand shook so  i spilled some of my chocolate  and so put it down again  and they were all very good  and looked another way  my master said  when abraham was out  i have a quite plain ring here  mr  peters  and i hope the ceremony will dignify the ring  and that i shall give my girl reason to think it  for that cause  the most valuable one that can be presented her  mr peters said  he was sure i should value it more than the richest diamond in the world i had bid mrs  jewkes not to dress herself  lest she should give cause of mistrust  and she took my advice when breakfast was over  my master said  before abraham  well gentlemen  we will step into the chapel  and you must give me your advice  as to the alterations i design  i am in the more haste  because the survey you are going to take of it  for the alterations  will take up a little time  and we shall have but a small space between that and dinner  for the little tour i design to make pamela  you ll give us your opinion  won t you  yes  sir  said i  i ll come after you so they went out  and i sat down in the chair again  and fanned myself i am sick at heart  said i  i think  mrs  jewkes  said she  shall i fetch you a little cordial no  said i  i am a sad fool  i want spirits  that s all  she took her smelling bottle  and would have given it me  but i said  keep it in your hand  may be i shall want it  but i hope not she gave me very good words  and begged me to go  and i got up  but my knees beat so against one another  i was forced to sit down again  but at last  i held by her arm  and passing by abraham  i said  this ugly slip  coming down stairs  has made me limp  though  so i must hold by you  mrs  jewkes  do you know what alterations there are to be in the chapel  that we must all give our opinions of them nan  she told me  was let into the secret  and she had ordered her to stay at the chapel door  to see that nobody came in  my dear master came to me  at entering the chapel  and took my hand  and led me up to the altar  remember  my dear girl  whispered he  and be cheerful  i am i will  sir  said i  but i hardly knew what i said  and so you may believe  when i said to mrs  jewkes  don t leave me  pray  mrs  jewkes don t leave me  as if i had all confidence in her  and none where it was most due  so she kept close to me  god forgive me  but i never was so absent in my life  as at first  even till mr  williams had gone on in the service  so far as to the awful words about requiring us  as we should answer at the dreadful day of judgment  and then the solemn words  and my master s whispering  mind this  my dear  made me start said he  still whispering  know you any impediment  i blushed  and said softly  none  sir  but my great unworthiness then followed the sweet words  wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife  etc  and i began to take heart a little  when my dearest master answered  audibly  to this question  i will  but i could only make a courtesy  when they asked me  though  i am sure  my heart was readier than my speech  and answered to every article of obey  serve  love  and honour mr  peters gave me away  and i said  after mr  williams  as well as i could  as my dear master did with a much better grace  the words of betrothment  and the ceremony of the ring passing next  i received the dear favour at his worthy hands with a most grateful heart  and he was pleased to say afterwards in the chariot  that when he had done saying with this ring i thee wed  etc  i made a courtesy  and said  thank you sir  may be i did  for i am sure it was a most grateful part of the service  and my heart was overwhelmed with his goodness  and the tender grace wherewith he performed it  i was very glad  that the next part was the prayer  and kneeling  for i trembled so  i could hardly stand betwixt fear and joy the joining of our hands afterwards  the declaration of our being married to the few witnesses present  for  reckoning nan  whose curiosity would not let her stay at the door  there were but mr  peters mrs  jewkes  and she  the blessing  the psalm  and the subsequent prayers  and the concluding exhortation  were so many beautiful welcome  and lovely parts of this divine office  that my heart began to be delighted with them  and my spirits to be a little freer and thus  my dearest  dear parents  is your happy  happy  thrice happy pamela  at last married  and to whom why  to her beloved  gracious master  the lord of her wishes  and thus the dear  once naughty assailer of her innocence  by a blessed turn of providence  is become the kind the generous protector and rewarder of it  god be evermore blessed and praised  and make me not wholly unworthy of such a transcendent honour and bless and reward the dear  dear  good gentleman  who has thus exalted his unworthy servant  and given her a place  which the greatest ladies would think themselves happy in my master saluted me most ardently  and said  god give you  my dear love  as much joy on this occasion  as i have  and he presented me to mr  peters  who saluted me  and said  you may excuse me  dear madam for i gave you away  and you are my daughter  and mr  williams modestly withdrawing a little way  mr  williams  said my master  pray accept my thanks  and wish your sister joy  so he saluted me too  and said  most heartily  madam  i do  and i will say  that to see so much innocence and virtue so eminently rewarded  is one of the greatest pleasures i have ever known  this my master took very kindly mrs  jewkes would have kissed my hand at the chapel door  but i put my arms about her neck  for i had got a new recruit of spirits just then and kissed her  and said  thank you  mrs  jewkes  for accompanying me  i have behaved sadly  no  madam  said she  pretty well  pretty well mr  peters walked out with me  and mr  williams and my master came out after us  talking together mr  peters  when we came into the parlour  said  i once more  madam must wish you joy on this happy occasion  i wish every day may add to your comforts  and may you very long rejoice in one another  for you are the loveliest couple i ever saw joined  i told him  i was highly obliged to his kind opinion  and good wishes  and hoped my future conduct would not make me unworthy of them my good benefactor came in with mr  williams  so  my dear life  said he how do you do  a little more composed  i hope  well  you see this is not so dreadful an affair as you apprehended sir  said mr  peters  very kindly  it is a very solemn circumstance  and i love to see it so reverently and awfully entered upon  it is a most excellent sign  for the most thoughtful beginnings make the most prudent proceedings mrs  jewkes  of her own accord  came in with a large silver tumbler filled with sack  and a toast  and nutmeg  and sugar  and my master said  that s well thought of  mrs  jewkes  for we have made but sorry breakfasting  and he would make me  take some of the toast  as they all did  and drank pretty heartily  and i drank a little  and it cheered my heart  i thought  for an hour after my master took a fine diamond ring from his finger  and presented it to mr  peters  who received it very kindly  and to mr  williams he said my old acquaintance  i have reserved for you  against a variety of solicitations  the living i always designed for you  and i beg you ll prepare to take possession of it  and as the doing it may be attended with some expense  pray accept of this towards it  and so he gave him as he told me afterwards it was  a bank note of l so did this generous good gentleman bless us all  and me in particular for whose sake he was as bounteous as if he had married one of the noblest fortunes so he took his leave of the gentlemen  recommending secrecy again  for a few days  and they left him  and none of the servants suspected any thing  as mrs  jewkes believes  and then i threw myself at his feet blessed god  and blessed him for his goodness  and he overwhelmed me with kindness  calling me his sweet bride  and twenty lovely epithets that swell my grateful heart beyond the power of utterance he afterwards led me to the chariot  and we took a delightful tour round the neighbouring villages  and he did all he could to dissipate those still perverse anxieties that dwell upon my mind  and  do what i can spread too thoughtful an air  as he tells me  over my countenance we came home again by half an hour after one  and he was pleasing himself with thinking  not to be an hour out of my company this blessed day  that as he was so good as to say  he might inspire me with a familiarity that should improve my confidence in him  when he was told that a footman of sir charles hargrave had been here  to let him know that his master  and two other gentlemen  were on the road to take a dinner with him  in their way to nottingham he was heartily vexed at this  and said to me  he should have been glad of their companies at any other time  but that it was a barbarous intrusion now  and he wished they had been told he would not be at home at dinner  and besides  said he  they are horrid drinkers  and i shan t be able to get them away to night  perhaps  for they have nothing to do but to travel round the country  and beat up their friends  quarters all the way  and it is all one to them  whether they stay a night or a month at a place  but  added he  i ll find some way  if i can  to turn them off  after dinner confound them  said he  in a violent pet  that they should come this day  of all the days in the year we had hardly alighted  and got in  before they came  three mad rakes they seemed to be  as i looked through the window  setting up a hunting note  as soon as they came to the gate  that made the court yard echo again  and smacking their whips in concert so i went up to my chamber  and saw what made my heart throb  mrs jewkes s officious pains to put the room in order for a guest  that however welcome  as now my duty teaches me to say  is yet dreadful to me to think of  so i took refuge in my closet  and had recourse to pen and ink  for my amusement  and to divert my anxiety of mind if one s heart is so sad  and one s apprehension so great  where one so extremely loves  and is so extremely obliged  what must be the case of those poor maidens  who are forced  for sordid views  by their tyrannical parents or guardians  to marry the man they almost hate  and  perhaps  to the loss of the man they most love  o that is a sad thing  indeed and what have not such cruel parents to answer for  and what do not such poor innocent victims suffer but  blessed be god  this lot is far from being mine my good master for i cannot yet have the presumption to call him by a more tender name  came up to me  and said  well  i just come to ask my dear bride o the charming  charming word  how she does  i see you are writing  my dear  said he  these confounded rakes are half mad  i think and will make me so  however  said he  i have ordered my chariot to be got ready  as if i was under an engagement five miles off  and will set them out of the house  if possible  and then ride round  and come back as soon as i can get rid of them  i find  said he  lady davers is full of our affairs  she has taken great freedoms with me before sir charles and they have all been at me  without mercy  and i was forced to be very serious with them  or else they would have come up to have seen you since i would not call you down he kissed me  and said  i shall quarrel with them  if i can t get them away  for i have lost two or three precious hours with my soul s delight  and so he went down mrs  jewkes asked me to walk down to dinner in the little parlour  i went down  and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at table  and would not be persuaded  without difficulty  to sit down with me  but i insisted she should  for  said i  it would be very extraordinary  if one should so soon go into such distance  mrs jewkes whatever my new station may require of me  added i  i hope i shall always conduct myself in such a manner  that pride and insolence shall bear no part in my character you are very good  madam  said she  but i will always know my duty to my master s lady why then  replied i  if i must take state upon me so early  mrs  jewkes  let me exact from you what you call your duty  and sit down with me when i desire you this prevailed upon her  and i made shift to get down a bit of apple pye  and a little custard  but that was all my good master came in again  and said  well  thank my stars  these rakes are going now  but i must set out with them  and i choose my chariot  for if i took horse  i should have difficulty to part with them  for they are like a snowball  and intend to gather company as they go  to make a merry tour of it for some days together we both got up  when he came in  fie  pamela  said he  why this ceremony now sit still  mrs  jewkes nay  sir  said she  i was loath to sit down  but my lady would have me she is very right  mrs  jewkes  said my master  and tapped me on the cheek  for we are but yet half married and so she is not above half your lady yet don t look so down  don t be so silent  my dearest  said he  why  you hardly spoke twenty words to me all the time we were out together  something i will allow for your bashful sweetness  but not too much mrs  jewkes  have you no pleasant tales to tell my pamela  to make her smile  till i return yes  sir said she  i could tell twenty pleasant stories  but my lady is too nice to hear them  and yet  i hope  i should not be shocking neither  ah poor woman  thought i  thy chastest stories will make a modest person blush  if i know thee  and i desire to hear none of them my master said  tell her one of the shortest you have  in my hearing why  sir  said she  i knew a bashful young lady  as madam may be married to dear mrs  jewkes  interrupted i  no more of your story  i beseech you  i don t like the beginning of it  go on  mrs  jewkes  said my master  no  pray  sir  don t require it  said i  pray don t  well said he  then we ll have it another time  mrs  jewkes abraham coming in to tell him the gentlemen were going  and that his chariot was ready  i am glad of that  said he  and went to them  and set out with them i took a turn in the garden with mrs  jewkes  after they were gone  and having walked a while  i said  i should be glad of her company down the elm walk  to meet the chariot  for  o  i know not how to look up at him when he is with me  nor how to bear his absence  when i have reason to expect him  what a strange contradiction there is in this unaccountable passion what a different aspect every thing in and about this house bears now to my thinking  to what it once had  the garden  the pond  the alcove the elm walk  but  oh  my prison is become my palace  and no wonder every thing wears another face we sat down upon the broad stile  leading towards the road  and mrs jewkes was quite another person to me  to what she was the last time i sat there at last my best beloved returned  and alighted there  what  my pamela and mrs  jewkes then left me  what said he  and kissed me  brings you this way  i hope to meet me yes  sir  said i  that s kind  indeed said he  but why that averted eye that downcast countenance  as if you was afraid of me  you must not think so  sir  said i  revive my heart then  said he  with a more cheerful aspect  and let that over anxious solicitude  which appears in the most charming face in the world  be chased from it have you  my dear girl any fears that i can dissipate any doubts that i can obviate  any hopes that i can encourage  any request that i can gratify speak  my dear pamela  and if i have power but speak  and to purchase one smile  it shall be done i cannot  sir  said i  have any fears  any doubts  but that i shall never be able to deserve all your goodness  i have no hopes  but that my future conduct may be agreeable to you  and my determined duty well accepted  nor have i any request to make  but that you will forgive all my imperfections and  among the rest  this foolish weakness  that makes me seem to you  after all the generous things that have passed  to want this further condescension  and these kind assurances  but indeed  sir i am oppressed by your bounty  my spirits sink under the weight of it and the oppression is still the greater  as i see not how  possibly in my whole future life  by all i can do  to merit the least of your favours i know your grateful heart  said he  but remember  my dear  what the lawyers tell us  that marriage is the highest consideration which the law knows  and this  my sweet bride  has made you mine  and me yours and you have the best claim in the world to share my fortune with me but  set that consideration aside  what is the obligation you have to me  your mind is pure as that of an angel  and as much transcends mine your wit  and your judgment  to make you no compliment  are more than equal to mine  you have all the graces that education can give a woman improved by a genius which makes those graces natural to you  you have a sweetness of temper  and a noble sincerity  beyond all comparison  and in the beauty of your person  you excel all the ladies i ever saw  where then  my dearest  is the obligation  if not on my side to you but  to avoid these comparisons  let us talk of nothing henceforth but equality although  if the riches of your mind  and your unblemished virtue  be set against my fortune  which is but an accidental good  as i may call it  and all i have to boast of  the condescension will be yours  and i shall not think i can possibly deserve you  till  after your sweet example  my future life shall become nearly as blameless as yours o  sir  said i  what comfort do you give me  that  instead of my being in danger of being ensnared by the high condition to which your goodness has exalted me  you make me hope  that i shall be confirmed and approved by you  and that we may have a prospect of perpetuating each other s happiness  till time shall be no more but  sir  i will not  as you once cautioned me  be too serious  i will resolve  with these sweet encouragements  to be  in every thing  what you would have me be  and i hope i shall  more and more  shew you that i have no will but yours  he kissed me very tenderly  and thanked me for this kind assurance  as he called it and so we entered the house together eight o clock at night now these sweet assurances  my dear father and mother  you will say must be very consolatory to me  and being voluntary on his side  were all that could be wished for on mine  and i was resolved  if possible to subdue my idle fears and apprehensions ten o clock at night as we sat at supper  he was generously kind to me  as well in his actions  as expressions  he took notice  in the most delicate manner  of my endeavour to conquer my foibles  and said  i see  with pleasure  my dear girl strives to comport herself in a manner suitable to my wishes i see  even through the sweet tender struggles of your over nice modesty  how much i owe to your intentions of obliging me  as i have once told you  that i am the conquest more of your virtue than your beauty  so not one alarming word or look shall my beloved pamela hear or see  to give her reason to suspect the truth of what i aver  you may the rather believe me  continued he  as you may see the pain i have to behold any thing that concerns you  even though your concern be causeless  and yet i will indulge my dear girl s bashful weakness so far  as to own  that so pure a mind may suffer from apprehension  on so important a change as this  and i can therefore be only displeased with such part of your conduct  as may make your sufferings greater than my own  when i am resolved  through every stage of my future life  in all events  to study to make them less after supper  of which  with all his sweet persuasions  i could hardly taste  he made me drink two glasses of champaign  and  afterwards  a glass of sack  which he kindly forced upon me  by naming your healths and as the time of retiring drew on  he took notice  but in a very delicate manner  how my colour went and came  and how foolishly i trembled  nobody  surely  in such delightful circumstances  ever behaved so silly and he said  my dearest girl  i fear you have had too much of my company for so many hours together  and would better recollect yourself  if you retired for half an hour to your closet i wished for this  but durst not say so much  lest he should be angry for  as the hours grew on  i found my apprehensions increase  and my silly heart was the unquieter  every time i could lift up my eyes to his dear face  so sweetly terrible did he appear to my apprehensions  i said  you are all goodness  dear sir  and i boldly kissed his dear hand  and pressed it to my lips with both mine  and saluting me very fervently  he gave me his hand  seeing me hardly able to stand  and led me to my chamber door  and then most generously withdrew i went to my closet  and the first thing i did  on my knees  again thanked god for the blessing of the day  and besought his divine goodness to conduct my future life in such a manner  as should make me a happy instrument of his glory  after this  being now left to my own recollection  i grew a little more assured and lightsome  and the pen and paper being before me  i amused myself with writing thus far eleven o clock thursday night mrs  jewkes being come up with a message  desiring to know  whether her master may attend upon me in my closet  and hinting to me  that however  she believed he did not expect to find me there  i have sent word  that i beg he would indulge me one quarter of an hour so committing myself to the mercies of the almighty  who has led me through so many strange scenes of terror and affrightment  to this happy  yet awful moment  i will wish you  my dear parents  a good night  and though you will not see this in time  yet i know i have your hourly prayers and therefore cannot fail of them now  so  good night  good night  god bless you  and god bless me  amen  amen  if it be his blessed will subscribes                                             your ever dutiful daughter friday evening o how this dear excellent man indulges me in every thing  every hour he makes me happier  by his sweet condescension  than the former  he pities my weakness of mind  allows for all my little foibles  endeavours to dissipate my fears  his words are so pure  his ideas so chaste  and his whole behaviour so sweetly decent  that never  surely  was so happy a creature as your pamela  i never could have hoped such a husband could have fallen to my lot  and much less  that a gentleman  who had allowed himself in attempts  that now i will endeavour to forget for ever should have behaved with so very delicate and unexceptionable a demeanour  no light frothy jests drop from his lips  no alarming railleries  no offensive expressions  nor insulting airs  reproach or wound the ears of your happy  thrice happy daughter  in short  he says every thing that may embolden me to look up  with pleasure  upon the generous author of my happiness at breakfast  when i knew not how to see him  he emboldened me by talking of you  my dear parents  a subject  he generously knew  i could talk of  and gave me assurances  that he would make you both happy he said  he would have me send you a letter to acquaint you with my nuptials  and  as he could make business that way  thomas should carry it purposely  as to morrow  nor will i  said he  my dear pamela  desire to see your writings  because i told you i would not  for now i will  in every thing  religiously keep my word with my dear spouse  o the dear delightful word  and you may send all your papers to them  from those they have  down to this happy moment  only let me beg they will preserve them  and let me have them when they have read them  as also those i have not seen  which  however  i desire not to see till then  but then shall take it for a favour  if you will grant it it will be my pleasure  as well as my duty  sir  said i  to obey you in every thing  and i will write up to the conclusion of this day  that they may see how happy you have made me i know you will both join with me to bless god for his wonderful mercies and goodness to you  as well as to me  for he was pleased to ask me particularly after your circumstances  and said  he had taken notice that i had hinted  in some of my first letters  that you owed money in the world  and he gave me fifty guineas  and bid me send them to you in my packet  to pay your debts  as far as they would go  and that you would quit your present business  and put yourself  and my dear mother into a creditable appearance  and he would find a better place of abode for you than that you had  when he returned to bedfordshire  o how shall i bear all these exceeding great and generous favours i send them wrapt up  five guineas in a parcel  in double papers to me he gave no less than one hundred guineas more  and said  i would have you  my dear  give mrs  jewkes  when you go away from hence  what you think fit out of these  as from yourself nay  good dear sir  said i  let that be what you please  give her  then  said he  twenty guineas as a compliment on your nuptials  give colbrand ten guineas give  the two coachmen five guineas each  to the two maids at this house five guineas each  give abraham five guineas  give thomas five guineas  and give the gardeners  grooms  and helpers  twenty guineas among them  and when  said he  i return with you to the other house  i will make you a suitable present  to buy you such ornaments as are fit for my beloved wife to appear in  for now  my pamela  continued he  you are not to mind  as you once proposed  what other ladies will say  but to appear as my wife ought to do  else it would look as if what you thought of  as a means to avoid the envy of others of your sex  was a wilful slight in me  which  i hope  i never shall be guilty of  and i will shew the world  that i value you as i ought  and as if i had married the first fortune in the kingdom  and why should it not be so  when i know none of the first quality that matches you in excellence he saw i was at a loss for words  and said  i see  my dearest bride  my spouse  my wife  my pamela  your grateful confusion  and kissing me  as i was going to speak  i will stop your dear mouth  said he  you shall not so much as thank me  for when i have done ten times more than this i shall but poorly express my love for so much beauty of mind  and loveliness of person  which thus  said he  and clasped me to his generous bosom  i can proudly now call my own o how  my dear parents can i think of any thing  but redoubled love  joy  and gratitude and thus generously did he banish from my mind those painful reflections  and bashful apprehensions  that made me dread to see him for the first time this day  when i was called to attend him at breakfast  and made me all ease  composure  and tranquillity he then  thinking i seemed somewhat thoughtful  proposed a little turn in the chariot till dinner time  and this was another sweet relief to me  and he diverted me with twenty agreeable relations  of what observations he had made in his travels  and gave me the characters of the ladies and gentlemen in his other neighbourhood  telling me whose acquaintance he would have me most cultivate  and when i mentioned lady davers with apprehension  he said  to be sure i love my sister dearly notwithstanding her violent spirit  and i know she loves me  and i can allow a little for her pride  because i know what my own so lately was and because she knows not my pamela  and her excellencies  as i do but you must not  my dear  forget what belongs to your character  as my wife  nor meanly stoop to her  though i know you will choose  by softness  to try to move her to a proper behaviour  but it shall be my part to see  that you do not yield too much however  continued he  as i would not publicly declare my marriage here i hope she won t come near us till we are in bedfordshire  and then when she knows we are married  she will keep away  if she is not willing to be reconciled  for she dares not  surely  come to quarrel with me when she knows it is done  for that would have a hateful and wicked appearance  as if she would try to make differences between man and wife but we will have no more of this subject  nor talk of any thing added he  that shall give concern to my dearest  and so he changed the talk to a more pleasing subject  and said the kindest and most soothing things in the world when we came home  which was about dinner time  he was the same obliging  kind gentleman  and  in short  is studious to shew  on every occasion  his generous affection to me  and  after dinner  he told me  he had already written to his draper  in town  to provide him new liveries  and to his late mother s mercer  to send him down patterns of the most fashionable silks  for my choice  i told him  i was unable to express my gratitude for his favours and generosity  and as he knew best what befitted his own rank and condition  i would wholly remit myself to his good pleasure  but  by all his repeated bounties to me  of so extraordinary a nature  i could not but look forward with awe upon the condition to which he had exalted me  and now i feared i should hardly be able to act up to it in such a manner as should justify the choice he had condescended to make  but that  i hoped  i should have not only his generous allowance for my imperfections  which i could only assure him should not be wilful ones  but his kind instructions  and that as often as he observed any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely approve  he would let me know it  and i would think his reproofs of beginning faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the world because they would keep me from committing greater  and be a means to continue to me the blessing of his good opinion he answered me in the kindest manner  and assured me  that nothing should ever lie upon his mind which he would not reveal  and give me an opportunity either of convincing him  or being convinced myself he then asked me  when i should be willing to go to the bedfordshire house  i said  whenever he pleased  we will come down hither again before the winter  said he  if you please  in order to cultivate the acquaintance you have begun with lady jones  and sir simon s family and  if it please god to spare us to one another  in the winter i will give you  as i promised for two or three months  the diversions of london  and i think  added he  if my dear pleases  we will set out next week  about tuesday  for t other house  i can have no objection  sir said i  to any thing you propose  but how will you avoid miss darnford s solicitation for an evening to dance  why  said he  we can make monday evening do for that purpose  if they won t excuse us  but  if you please  said he  i will invite lady jones  mr  peters and his family and sir simon and his family  to my little chapel  on sunday morning and to stay dinner with me  and then i will declare my marriage to them because my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason for a possibility of any body s doubting that it is so  o  how good was this  but  indeed  his conduct is all of a piece  noble  kind  and considerate  what a happy creature am i and then  may be  said he they will excuse us till we return into this country again  as to the ball  is there any thing  added he  that my beloved pamela has still to wish  if you have  freely speak hitherto  my dearest sir  replied i  you have not only prevented my wishes  but my hopes  and even my thoughts  and yet i must own  since your kind command of speaking my mind seems to shew  that you expect from me i should say something  that i have only one or two things to wish more  and then i shall be too happy  say  said he  what they are sir  proceeded i  i am  indeed  ashamed to ask any thing  lest it should not be agreeable to you  and lest it should look as if i was taking advantage of your kind condescensions to me  and knew not when to be satisfied i will only tell you  pamela  said he  that you are not to imagine that these things  which i have done  in hopes of obliging you  are the sudden impulses of a new passion for you  but  if i can answer for my own mind  they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of obliging you  which  i hope  will last as long as your merit lasts  and that  i make no doubt  will be as long as i live  and i can the rather answer for this  because i really find so much delight in myself in my present way of thinking and acting  as infinitely overpays me  and which  for that reason  i am likely to continue  for both our sakes  my beloved wife  therefore  said he  for methinks i am grown fond of a name i once despised  may venture to speak her mind  and i will promise  that  so far as it is agreeable to me  and i cheerfully can  i will comply  and you will not insist upon it  if that should not be the case to be sure  sir  said i  i ought not  neither will i  and now you embolden me to become an humble petitioner  and that  as i ought  upon my knees  for the reinstating such of your servants  as i have been the unhappy occasion of their disobliging you  he raised me up  and said my beloved pamela has too often been in this suppliant posture to me to permit it any more  rise  my fairest  and let me know whom  in particular  you would reinstate  and he kindly held me in his arms  and pressed me to his beloved bosom  mrs  jervis  sir  said i  in the first place  for she is a good woman  and the misfortunes she has had in the world  must make your displeasure most heavy to her well  said he  who next  mr  longman  sir  said i  and i am sure  kind as they have been to me  yet would i not ask it  if i could not vouch for their integrity  and if i did not think it was my dear master s interest to have such good servants have you any thing further  said he sir  said i  your good old butler who has so long been in your family before the day of your happy birth i would  if i might  become an advocate for well  said he  i have only to say  that had not mr  longman and mrs jervis  and jonathan too  joined in a body  in a bold appeal to lady davers  which has given her the insolent handle she has taken to intermeddle in my affairs  i could easily have forgiven all the rest of their conduct  though they have given their tongues no little license about me  but i could have forgiven them  because i desire every body should admire you  and it is with pride that i observe not only their opinion and love  but that of every body else that knows you  justify my own but yet  i will forgive even this  because my pamela desires it and i will send a letter myself  to tell longman what he owes to your interposition  if the estate he has made in my family does not set him above the acceptance of it  and  as to mrs  jervis  do you  my dear write a letter to her  and give her your commands  instantly  on  the receipt of it  to go and take possession of her former charge  for now my dearest girl  she will be more immediately your servant  and i know you love her so well  that you ll go thither with the more pleasure to find her there but don t think  added he  that all this compliance is to be for nothing  ah  sir  said i  tell me but what i can do  poor as i am in power  but rich in will  and i will not hesitate one moment  why then  said he  of your own accord  reward me for my cheerful compliance with one sweet kiss i instantly said  thus  then  dear sir  will i obey  and  oh  you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world to make that a condition  which gives me double honour  and adds to my obligations  and so i clasped my arms about his neck  and was not ashamed to kiss him once and twice  and three times  once for every forgiven person now  my dearest pamela  said he  what other things have you to ask  mr williams is already taken care of  and  i hope  will be happy have you nothing to say for john arnold why  dear sir  said i  you have seen the poor fellow s penitence in my letters yes  my dear  so i have  but that is his penitence for his having served me against you  and  i think  when he would have betrayed me afterwards  he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either but  dear sir  said i  this is a day of jubilee  and the less he deserves  poor fellow  the more will be your goodness  and let me add one word  that as he was divided in his inclinations between his duty to you and good wishes to me  and knew not how to distinguish between the one and the other  when he finds us so happily united by your great goodness to me  he will have no more puzzles in his duty  for he has not failed in any other part of it  but  i hope  will serve you faithfully for the future well  then  suppose i put mrs  jewkes in a good way of business  in some inn  and give her john for a husband  and then your gipsy story will be made out  that she will have a husband younger than herself you are all goodness  sir  said i  i can freely forgive poor mrs jewkes  and wish her happy  but permit me  sir  to ask  would not this look like a very heavy punishment to poor john  and as if you could not forgive him  when you are so generous to every body else he smiled and said  o my pamela  this  for a forgiving spirit  is very severe upon poor jewkes  but i shall never  by the grace of god  have any more such trying services  to put him or the rest upon  and if you can forgive him  i think i may  and so john shall be at your disposal and now let me know what my pamela has further to wish o  my dearest sir  said i  not a single wish more has your grateful pamela  my heart is overwhelmed with your goodness  forgive these tears of joy  added i  you have left me nothing to pray for  but that god will bless you with life  and health  and honour  and continue to me the blessing of your esteem  and i shall then be the happiest creature in the world he clasped me in his arms  and said  you cannot  my dear life  be so happy in me  as i am in you  o how heartily i despise all my former pursuits  and headstrong appetites  what joys  what true joys  flow from virtuous love  joys which the narrow soul of the libertine cannot take in  nor his thoughts conceive  and which i myself  whilst a libertine had not the least notion of but  said he  i expected my dear spouse  my pamela  had something to ask for herself  but since all her own good is absorbed in the delight her generous heart takes in promoting that of others  it shall be my study to prevent her wishes  and to make her care for herself unnecessary  by my anticipating kindness in this manner  my dear parents  is your happy daughter blessed in a husband  o how my exulting heart leaps at the dear  dear word and i have nothing to do  but to be humble  and to look up with gratitude to the all gracious dispenser of these blessings so  with a thousand thanks  i afterwards retired to my closet  to write you thus far  and having completed what i purpose for this packet  and put up the kind obliging present  i have nothing more to say  but that i hope soon to see you both  and receive your blessings on this happy thrice happy occasion  and so  hoping for your prayers  that i may preserve an humble and upright mind to my gracious god  a dutiful gratitude to my dear master and husband that i may long rejoice in the continuance of these blessings and favours  and that i may preserve at the same time  an obliging deportment to every one else  i conclude myself  your ever dutiful and most happy daughter                                                         pamela b o think it not my pride  my dear parents  that sets me on glorying in my change of name  yours will be always dear to me  and what i shall never be ashamed of  i m sure  but yet for such a husband what shall i say since words are too faint to express my gratitude and my joy i have taken copies of my master s letter to mr  longman  and mine to mrs  jervis  which i will send with the further occurrences  when i go to the other dear house  or give you when i see you  as i now hope soon to do saturday morning  the third of my happy nuptials i must still write on  till i come to be settled in the duty of the station to which i am so generously exalted  and to let you participate with me the transporting pleasures that rise from my new condition  and the favours that are hourly heaped upon me by the best of husbands  when i had got my packet for you finished  i then set about writing  as he had kindly directed me  to mrs  jervis  and had no difficulty till i came to sign my name  and so i brought it down with me  when i was called to supper  unsigned my good master for i delight  and always shall  to call him by that name  had been writing to mr  longman  and he said  pleasantly  see here  my dearest  what i have written to your somebody  i read as follows mr  longman i have the pleasure to acquaint you  that last thursday i was married to my beloved pamela  i have had reason to be disobliged with you  and mrs  jervis and jonathan  not for your kindness to  and regard for  my dear spouse  that now is  but for the manner  in which you appealed to my sister davers  which has made a very wide breach between her and me but as it was one of her first requests  that i would overlook what had passed  and reinstate you in all your former charges  i think myself obliged  without the least hesitation  to comply with it  so  if you please  you may enter again upon an office which you have always executed with unquestionable integrity  and to the satisfaction of yours etc friday afternoon i shall set out next tuesday or wednesday for bedfordshire  and desire to find jonathan  as well as you  in your former offices  in which i dare say  you ll have the more pleasure  as you have such an early instance of the sentiments of my dear wife  from whose goodness you may expect every agreeable thing  she writes herself to mrs  jervis i thanked him most gratefully for his goodness  and afterwards took the above copy of it  and shewed him my letter to mrs  jervis  as follows my dear mrs  jervis i have joyful tidings to communicate to you  for yesterday i was happily married to the best of gentlemen  yours and my beloved master i have only now to tell you  that i am inexpressibly happy  that my generous benefactor denies me nothing  and even anticipates my wishes you may be sure i could not forget my dear mrs  jervis  and i made it my request  and had it granted  as soon as asked  that you might return to the kind charge  which you executed with so much advantage to our master s interest  and so much pleasure to all under your direction  all the power that is put into my hands  by the most generous of men  shall be exerted to make every thing easy and agreeable to you  and as i shall soon have the honour of attending my beloved to bedfordshire  it will be a very considerable addition to my delight  and to my unspeakable obligations to the best of men  to see my dear mrs  jervis  and to be received by her with that pleasure  which i promise myself from her affection  for i am  my dear good friend  and always will be                    yours  very affectionately  and gratefully                                                         pamela he read this letter  and said  tis yours  my dear  and must be good but don t you put your name to it  sir  said i  your goodness has given me a right to a very honourable one but as this is the first occasion of the kind  except that to my dear father and mother  i think i ought to shew it you unsigned  that i may not seem over forward to take advantage of the honour you have done me however sweetly humble and requisite  said he  this may appear to my dear pamela s niceness  it befits me to tell you  that i am every moment more and more pleased with the right you have to my name  and  my dear life  added he  i have only to wish i may be half as worthy as you are of the happy knot so lately knit  he then took a pen himself  and wrote  after pamela  his most worthy sirname  and i under wrote thus o rejoice with me  my dear mrs  jervis  that i am enabled  by god s graciousness  and my dear master s goodness  thus to write myself these letters  and the packet to you  were sent away by mr  thomas early this morning my dearest master is just gone to take a ride out  and intends to call upon lady jones  mr  peters  and sir simon darnford  to invite them to chapel and dinner to morrow  and says  he chooses to do it himself because the time is so short  they will  perhaps  deny a servant i forgot to mention  that mr  williams was here yesterday  to ask leave to go to see his new living  and to provide for taking possession of it and seemed so pleased with my master s kindness and fondness for me  as well as his generous deportment to himself  that he left us in such a disposition  as shewed he was quite happy  i am very glad of it  for it would rejoice me to be an humble means of making all mankind so  and oh what returns ought i not to make to the divine goodness  and how ought i to strive to diffuse the blessings i experience  to all in my knowledge for else  what is it for such a worm as i to be exalted what is my single happiness  if i suffer it  niggard like  to extend no farther than to myself but then  indeed  do god almighty s creatures act worthy of the blessings they receive  when they make  or endeavour to make  the whole creation  so far as is in the circle of their power happy great and good god  as thou hast enlarged my opportunities  enlarge also my will  and make me delight in dispensing to others a portion of that happiness  which i have myself so plentifully received at the hand of thy gracious providence  then shall i not be useless in my generation then shall i not stand a single mark of thy goodness to a poor worthless creature  that in herself is of so small account in the scale of beings  a mere cipher on the wrong side of a figure  but shall be placed on the right side  and  though nothing worth in myself  shall give signification by my place  and multiply the blessings i owe to thy goodness  which has distinguished me by so fair a lot this  as i conceive  is the indispensable duty of a high condition  and how great must be the condemnation of poor creatures  at the great day of account  when they shall be asked  what uses they have made of the opportunities put into their hands  and are able only to say  we have lived but to ourselves  we have circumscribed all the power thou hast given us into one narrow  selfish  compass  we have heaped up treasures for those who came after us  though we knew not whether they would not make a still worse use of them than we ourselves did  and how can such poor selfish pleaders expect any other sentence  than the dreadful depart  ye cursed but sure  my dear father and mother  such persons can have no notion of the exalted pleasures that flow from doing good  were there to be no after account at all there is something so satisfactory and pleasing to reflect on the being able to administer comfort and relief to those who stand in need of it as infinitely  of itself  rewards the beneficent mind  and how often have i experienced this in my good lady s time  though but the second hand dispenser of her benefits to the poor and sickly  when she made me her almoner how have i been affected with the blessings which the miserable have heaped upon her for her goodness  and upon me for being but the humble conveyer of her bounty to them and how delighted have i been  when the moving report i have made of a particular distress  has augmented my good lady s first intentions in relief of it this i recall with pleasure  because it is now  by the divine goodness become my part to do those good things she was wont to do  and oh  let me watch myself  that my prosperous state do not make me forget to look up  with due thankfulness  to the providence which has entrusted me with the power  that so i may not incur a terrible woe by the abuse or neglect of it forgive me these reflections  my dear parents  and let me have your prayers  that i may not find my present happiness a snare to me  but that i may consider  that more and more will be expected from me  in proportion to the power given me  and that i may not so unworthily act as if i believed i ought to set up my rest in my mean self  and think nothing further to be done  with the opportunities put into my hand  by the divine favour  and the best of men saturday  seven o clock in the evening my master returned home to dinner  in compliment to me  though much pressed to dine with lady jones  as he was  also  by sir simon  to dine with him  but mr  peters could not conveniently provide a preacher for his own church tomorrow morning  at so short a notice  mr  williams being gone  as i said  to his new living  but believed he could for the afternoon  and so he promised to give us his company to dinner  and to read afternoon service  and this made my master invite all the rest  as well as him  to dinner  and not to church  and he made them promise to come  and told mr  peters  he would send his coach for him and his family miss darnford told him pleasantly  she would not come  unless he would promise to let her be at his wedding  by which i find mr  peters has kept the secret  as my master desired he was pleased to give me an airing after dinner in the chariot  and renewed his kind assurances to me  and  if possible  is kinder than ever  this is sweetly comfortable to me  because it shews me he does not repent of his condescensions to me  and it encourages me to look up to him with more satisfaction of mind  and less doubtfulness i begged leave to send a guinea to a poor body in the town  that i heard  by mrs  jewkes  lay very ill  and was very destitute  he said send two  my dear  if you please  said i  sir  i will never do any thing of this kind without letting you know what i do  he most generously answered  i shall then  perhaps  have you do less good than you would otherwise do  from a doubt of me  though  i hope  your discretion  and my own temper  which is not avaricious  will make such doubt causeless now  my dear  continued he  i ll tell you how we will order this point to avoid even the shadow of uneasiness on one side  or doubt on the other as to your father and mother  in the first place  they shall be quite out of the question  for i have already determined in my mind about them  and it is thus  they shall go down  if they and you think well of it  to my little kentish estate  which i once mentioned to you in such a manner  as made you reject it with a nobleness of mind  that gave me pain then  but pleasure since  there is a pretty little farm  and house untenanted  upon that estate  and tolerably well stocked  and i will further stock it for them  for such industrious folks won t know how to live without some employment  and it shall be theirs for both their lives  without paying any rent  and i will allow them l  per annum besides  that they may keep up the stock  and be kind to any other of their relations  without being beholden to you or me for small matters and for greater  where needful  you shall always have it in your power to accommodate them  for i shall never question your prudence  and we will  so long as god spares our lives  go down  once a year  to see them  and they shall come up  as often as they please  it cannot be too often  to see us  for i mean not this  my dear  to send them from us before i proceed  does my pamela like this o  sir  said i  the english tongue affords not words  or  at least  i have them not  to express sufficiently my gratitude  teach me  dear sir continued i  and pressed his dear hand to my lips  teach me some other language  if there be any  that abounds with more grateful terms  that i may not thus be choked with meanings  for which i can find no utterance my charmer  says he  your language is all wonderful  as your sentiments and you most abound  when you seem most to want all that i wish  is to find my proposals agreeable to you  and if my first are not  my second shall be  if i can but know what you wish did i say too much  my dearest parents  when i said  he was  if possible  kinder and kinder o the blessed man  how my heart is overwhelmed with his goodness well  said he  my dearest  let me desire you to mention this to them  to see if they approve it  but  if it be your choice  and theirs  to have them nearer to you  or even under the same roof with you  i will freely consent to it o no  sir  said i  and i fear almost sinned in my grateful flight  i am sure they would not choose that  they could not  perhaps  serve god so well if they were to live with you  for  so constantly seeing the hand that blesses them  they would  it may be  as must be my care to avoid  be tempted to look no further in their gratitude  than to the dear dispenser of such innumerable benefits excellent creature  said he  my beloved wants no language  nor sentiments neither  and her charming thoughts  so sweetly expressed would grace any language  and this is a blessing almost peculiar to my fairest your so kind acceptance  my pamela  added he  repays the benefit with interest  and leaves me under obligation to your goodness but now  my dearest  i will tell you what we will do  with regard to points of your own private charity  for far be it from me  to put under that name the subject we have been mentioning  because that  and more than that  is duty to persons so worthy  and so nearly related to my pamela  and  as such  to myself o how the sweet man outdoes me  in thoughts  words  power  and every thing and this  said he  lies in very small compass  for i will allow you two hundred pounds a year  which longman shall constantly pay you  at fifty pounds a quarter  for your own use  and of which i expect no account to commence from the day you enter into my other house  i mean  said he that the first fifty pounds shall then be due  because you shall have something to begin with  and  added the dear generous man  if this be pleasing to you  let it  since you say you want words  be signified by such a sweet kiss as you gave me yesterday  i hesitated not a moment to comply with these obliging terms  and threw my arms about his dear neck though in the chariot  and blessed his goodness to me  but  indeed  sir said i  i cannot bear this generous treatment  he was pleased to say don t be uneasy  my dear  about these trifles  god has blessed me with a very good estate  and all of it in a prosperous condition  and generally well tenanted  i lay up money every year  and have  besides  large sums in government and other securities  so that you will find  what i have hitherto promised  is very short of that proportion of my substance which  as my dearest wife  you have a right to in this sweet manner did we pass our time till evening  when the chariot brought us home  and then our supper succeeded in the same agreeable manner  and thus  in a rapturous circle  the time moves on  every hour bringing with it something more delightful than the past sure nobody was ever so blest as i sunday  the fourth day of my happiness not going to chapel this morning  the reason of which i told you  i bestowed the time  from the hour of my beloved s rising  to breakfast in prayer and thanksgiving  in my closet  and now i begin to be quite easy  cheerful  and free in my spirits  and the rather  as i find myself encouraged by the tranquillity  and pleasing vivacity  in the temper and behaviour of my beloved  who thereby shews he does not repent of his goodness to me i attended him to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom  and he seemed quite pleased with me  and said  now does my dearest begin to look upon me with an air of serenity and satisfaction  it shall be always  added he  my delight to give you occasion for this sweet becoming aspect of confidence and pleasure in me my heart  dear sir said i  is quite easy  and has lost all its foolish tumults  which combating with my gratitude  might give an unacceptable appearance to my behaviour  but now your goodness  sir  has enabled it to get the better of its uneasy apprehensions  and my heart is all of one piece  and devoted to you  and grateful tranquillity  and could i be so happy as to see you and my good lady davers reconciled  i have nothing in this world to wish for more  but the continuance of your favour  he said  i wish this reconciliation  my dearest  as well as you  and i do assure you more for your sake than my own  and if she would behave tolerably  i would make the terms easier to her  for that reason he said  i will lay down one rule for you  my pamela  to observe in your dress  and i will tell you every thing i like or dislike  as it occurs to me  and i would have you do the same  on your part  that nothing may be upon either of our minds that may occasion the least reservedness i have often observed  in married folks  that  in a little while  the lady grows careless in her dress  which  to me  looks as if she would take no pains to secure the affection she had gained  and shews a slight to her husband  that she had not to her lover  now  you must know  this has always given me great offence  and i should not forgive it  even in my pamela  though she would have this excuse for herself  that thousands could not make  that she looks lovely in every thing  so  my dear i shall expect of you always to be dressed by dinner time  except something extraordinary happens  and this  whether you are to go abroad or stay at home  for this  my love  will continue to you that sweet ease in your dress and behaviour  which you are so happy a mistress of  and whomsoever i bring home with me to my table  you ll be in readiness to receive them  and will not want to make those foolish apologies to unexpected visitors  that carry with them a reflection on the conduct of those who make them  and  besides  will convince me  that you think yourself obliged to appear as graceful to your husband  as you would to persons less familiar to your sight this  dear sir  said i  is a most obliging injunction  and i most heartily thank you for it  and will always take care to obey it why my dear  said he  you may better do this than half your sex  because they too generally act in such a manner  as if they seemed to think it the privilege of birth and fortune  to turn day into night  and night into day  and are seldom stirring till it is time to sit down to dinner and so all the good old family rules are reversed  for they breakfast when they should dine  dine  when they should sup  and sup  when they should go to bed  and  by the help of dear quadrille  sometimes go to bed when they should rise in all things but these  my dear  continued he  i expect you to be a lady  and my good mother was one of this oldfashioned cut  and  in all other respects  as worthy a lady as any in the kingdom  and so you have not been used to the new way  and may the easier practise the other dear sir  said i  pray give me more of your sweet injunctions  why then  continued he  i shall  in the usual course  and generally  if not hindered by company  like to go to bed with my dearest by eleven  and if i don t  shan t hinder you  i ordinarily now rise by six in summer  i will allow you to be half an hour after me  or so then you ll have some time you may call your own  till you give me your company to breakfast  which may be always so  as that we may have done at a little after nine then will you have several hours again at your disposal  till two o clock  when i shall like to sit down at table you will then have several useful hours more to employ yourself in  as you shall best like  and i would generally go to supper by eight  and when we are resolved to stick to these oldfashioned rules  as near as we can  we shall have our visitors conform to them too  and expect them from us  and suit themselves accordingly  for i have always observed that it is in every one s power to prescribe rules to himself  it is only standing a few ridiculous jests at first  and that too from such generally  as are not the most worthy to be minded  and  after a while they will say  it signifies nothing to ask him  he will have his own way  there is no putting him out of his bias  he is a regular piece of clock work  they will joke  and all that  and why  my dear  should we not be so  for man is as frail a piece of machinery as any clock work whatever  and  by irregularity  is as subject to be disordered then  my dear  continued the charming man  when they see they are received  at my own times  with an open countenance and cheerful heart when they see plenty and variety at my board  and meet a kind and hearty welcome from us both  they will not offer to break in upon my conditions  nor grudge me my regular hours  and as most of these people have nothing to do  except to rise in a morning  they may as well come to breakfast with us at half an hour after eight  in summer  as at ten or eleven  to dinner at two  as at four  five  or six  and to supper at eight  as at ten or eleven  and then our servants  too  will know generally  the times of their business  and the hours of their leisure or recess  and we  as well as they  shall reap the benefits of this regularity  and who knows  my dear  but we may revive the good oldfashion in our neighbourhood  by this means at least it will be doing our parts towards it  and answering the good lesson i learned at school  every one mend one  and the worst that will happen will be  that when some of my brother rakes  such as those who broke in upon us  so unwelcomely  last thursday  are got out of the way  if that can ever be and begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in their rambles they will only say  we must not go to him  for his dinner time is over and so they ll reserve me for another time  when they happen to suit it better  or  perhaps  they will take a supper and a bed with me instead of it now  my dearest  continued the kind man  you see here are more of my injunctions  as you call them  and though i will not be so set  as to quarrel  if they are not always exactly complied with  yet  as i know you won t think them unreasonable  i shall be glad they may  as often as they can  and you will give your orders accordingly to your mrs  jervis who is a good woman  and will take pleasure in obeying you o dearest  dear sir  said i  have you nothing more to honour me with you oblige and improve me at the same time what a happy lot is mine why  let me see  my dearest  said he but i think of no more at present for it would be needless to say how much i value you for your natural sweetness of temper  and that open cheerfulness of countenance  which adorns you  when nothing has given my fairest apprehensions for her virtue  a sweetness  and a cheerfulness  that prepossesses in your favour  at first sight  the mind of every one that beholds you i need not  i hope  say  that i would have you diligently preserve this sweet appearance  let no thwarting accident  no cross fortune  for we must not expect to be exempt from such  happy as we now are in each other deprive this sweet face of this its principal grace  and when any thing unpleasing happens  in a quarter of an hour  at farthest  begin to mistrust yourself  and apply to your glass  and if you see a gloom arising  or arisen  banish it instantly  smooth your dear countenance resume your former composure  and then  my dearest  whose heart must always be seen in her face  and cannot be a hypocrite  will find this a means to smooth her passions also  and if the occasion be too strong for so sudden a conquest  she will know how to do it more effectually  by repairing to her closet  and begging that gracious assistance  which has never yet failed her  and so shall i  my dear  who  as you once but too justly observed  have been too much indulged by my good mother  have an example from you  as well as a pleasure in you  which will never be palled one thing  continued he  i have frequently observed at the house of many a gentleman  that when we have unexpectedly visited  or broken in upon the family order laid down by the lady  and especially if any of us have lain under the suspicion of having occasionally seduced our married companion into bad hours  or given indifferent examples  the poor gentleman has been oddly affected at our coming  though the good breeding of the lady has made her just keep up appearances  he has looked so conscious  has been so afraid  as it were  to disoblige  has made so many excuses for some of us  before we had been accused  as have always shewn me how unwelcome we have been  and how much he is obliged to compound with his lady for a tolerable reception of us  and  perhaps she too  in proportion to the honest man s concern to court her smiles has been more reserved  stiff  and formal  and has behaved with an indifference and slight that has often made me wish myself out of her house  for too plainly have i seen that it was not his this  my dear  you will judge  by my description  has afforded me subject for animadversion upon the married life  for a man may not though  in the main  he is willing to flatter himself that he is master of his house  and will assert his prerogative upon great occasions  when it is strongly invaded  be always willing to contend  and such women as those i have described  are always ready to take the field  and are worse enemies than the old parthians  who annoy most when they seem to retreat  and never fail to return to the charge again  and carry on the offensive war  till they have tired out resistance  and made the husband willing  like a vanquished enemy  to compound for small matters  in order to preserve something  at least the poor man does not care to let his friends see his case  and so will not provoke a fire to break out that he sees and so do his friends too  the meek lady has much ado to smother  and which  very possibly  burns with a most comfortable ardour after we are gone you smile  my pamela  said he  at this whimsical picture  and  i am sure  i never shall have reason to include you in these disagreeable outlines  but yet i will say  that i expect from you  whoever comes to my house  that you accustom yourself to one even  uniform complaisance that no frown take place on your brow  that however ill or well provided we may be for their reception  you shew no flutter or discomposure  that whoever you may have in your company at the time  you signify not by the least reserved look  that the stranger is come upon you unseasonably  or at a time you wished he had not  but be facetious kind  obliging to all  and  if to one more than another  to such as have the least reason to expect it from you  or who are most inferior at the table  for thus will you  my pamela  cheer the doubting mind  quiet the uneasy heart  and diffuse ease  pleasure  and tranquillity  around my board and be sure  my dear  continued he  let no little accidents ruffle your temper  i shall never forget once that i was at lady arthur s  and a footman happened to stumble  and let fall a fine china dish  and broke it all to pieces  it was grievous to see the uneasiness it gave the poor lady  and she was so sincere in it  that she suffered it to spread all over the company  and it was a pretty large one too  and not a person in it but turned either her consoler  or fell into stories of the like misfortunes  and so we all became  for the rest of the evening  nothing but blundering footmen  and careless servants  or were turned into broken jars  plates  glasses  tea cups  and such like brittle substances  and it affected me so much  that  when i came home  i went to bed  and dreamt  that robin  with the handle of his whip  broke the fore glass of my chariot  and i was so solicitous  methought  to keep the good lady in countenance for her anger  that i broke his head in revenge  and stabbed one of my coach horses  and all the comfort i had when it was done  methought  was  that i had not exposed myself before company  and there were no sufferers  but guilty robin  and one innocent coach horse i was exceedingly diverted with the facetious hints  and the pleasant manner in which he gave them  and i promised to improve by the excellent lessons contained in them i then went up and dressed myself  as like a bride as i could  in my best clothes  and  on inquiry  hearing my dearest master was gone to walk in the garden  i went to find him out  he was reading in the little alcove  and i said  sir  am i licensed to intrude upon you no  my dear  said he  because you cannot intrude  i am so wholly yours  that wherever i am  you have not only a right to join me  but you do me a very acceptable favour at the same time i have  sir  said i  obeyed your first kind injunction  as to dressing myself before dinner  but may be you are busy  sir  he put up the papers he was reading  and said  i can have no business or pleasure of equal value to your company  my dear  what were you going to say only  sir to know if you have any more kind injunctions to give me i could hear you talk a whole day together you are very obliging  pamela  said he but you are so perfectly what i wish  that i might have spared those i gave you  but i was willing you should have a taste of my freedom with you  to put you upon the like with me  for i am confident there can be no friendship lasting  without freedom  and without communicating to one another even the little caprices  if my pamela can have any such  which may occasion uneasiness to either now  my dear  said he  be so kind as to find some fault with me  and tell me what you would wish me to do  to appear more agreeable to you o sir  said i  and i could have kissed him  but for shame  to be sure i shall grow a sad fond hussy  i have not one single thing to wish for no  not one he saluted me very kindly  and said  he should be sorry if i had  and forbore to speak it  do you think  my dear sir  said i  that your pamela has no conscience  do you think  that because you so kindly oblige her  and delight in obliging her  that she must rack her invention for trials of your goodness  and knows not when she s happy o my dearest sir  added i  less than one half of the favours you have so generously conferred upon me  would have exceeded my utmost wishes my dear angel  said he  and kissed me again  i shall be troublesome to you with my kisses  if you continue thus sweetly obliging in your actions and expressions  o sir  said i  i have been thinking  as i was dressing myself  what excellent lessons you teach me when you commanded me  at your table to cheer the doubting mind and comfort the uneasy heart  and to behave most kindly to those who have least reason to expect it  and are most inferior  how sweetly  in every instance that could possibly occur  have you done this yourself by your poor  unworthy pamela  till you have diffused  in your own dear words ease  pleasure  and tranquillity  around my glad heart then again  sir  when you bid me not be disturbed by little accidents or by strangers coming in upon me unexpectedly  how noble an instance did you give me of this  when  on our happy wedding day  the coming of sir charles hargrave  and the other two gentlemen  for which you were quite unprovided  and which hindered our happiness of dining together on that chosen day  did not so disturb you  but that you entertained the gentlemen pleasantly  and parted with them civilly and kindly  what charming instances are these  i have been recollecting with pleasure  of your pursuing the doctrine you deliver my dear  said he  these observations are very kind in you  and much to my advantage  but if i do not always for i fear these were too much accidents  so well pursue the doctrines i lay down  my pamela must not expect that my imperfections will be a plea for her nonobservance of my lessons  as you call them  for  i doubt i shall never be half so perfect as you  and so i cannot permit you to recede in your goodness  though i may find myself unable to advance as i ought in my duty i hope  sir  said i  by god s grace  i never shall  i believe it  said he  but i only mention this  knowing my own defects  lest my future lessons should not be so well warranted by my practice  as in the instances you have kindly recollected he was pleased to take notice of my dress  and spanning my waist with his hands  said  what a sweet shape is here  it would make one regret to lose it  and yet  my beloved pamela  i shall think nothing but that loss wanting  to complete my happiness i put my bold hand before his mouth and said  hush  hush  o fie  sir the freest thing you have ever yet said  since i have been yours he kissed my hand  and said  such an innocent wish  my dearest  may be permitted me  because it is the end of the institution but say  would such a case be unwelcome to my pamela i will say  sir  said i  and hid my blushing face on his bosom that your wishes  in every thing  shall be mine  but  pray  sir  say no more  he kindly saluted me  and thanked me  and changed the subject i was not too free  i hope thus we talked  till we heard the coaches  and then he said  stay here in the garden  my dear  and i ll bring the company to you  and when he was gone  i passed by the back door  kneeled down against it  and blessed god for not permitting my then so much desired escape  i went to the pond  and kneeled down on the mossy bank  and again blessed god there  for his mercy in my escape from myself  my then worst enemy though i thought i had none but enemies  and no friend near me  and so i ought to do in almost every step of this garden  and every room in this house and i was bending my steps to the dear little chapel  to make my acknowledgment there  but i saw the company coming towards me miss darnford said  so  miss andrews  how do you do now  o  you look so easy  so sweetly  so pleased  that i know you ll let me dance at your wedding  for i shall long to be there  lady jones was pleased to say i looked like an angel  and mrs  peters said  i improved upon them every time they saw me  lady darnford was also pleased to make me a fine compliment  and said  i looked freer and easier every time she saw me dear heart  i wish  thought i  you would spare these compliments  for i shall have some joke  i doubt  passed on me by and by  that will make me suffer for all these fine things mr  peters said  softly  god bless you  dear daughter but not so much as my wife knows it sir simon came in last  and took me by the hand and said  mr  b  by your leave  and kissed my hand five or six times  as if he was mad  and held it with both his  and made a very free jest  by way of compliment  in his way  well  i think a young rake is hardly tolerable  but an old rake  and an old beau  are two very sad things and all this before daughters  women grown i whispered my dearest  a little after  and said  i fear i shall suffer much from sir simon s rude jokes  by and by  when you reveal the matter tis his way  my dear  said he  you must now grow above these things miss nanny darnford said to me  with a sort of half grave  ironical air well miss andrews  if i may judge by your easy deportment now  to what it was when i saw you last  i hope you will let my sister  if you won t me  see the happy knot tied  for she is quite wild about it i courtesied and only said  you are all very good to me  ladies mr  peters s niece said  well  miss andrews  i hope  before we part  we shall be told the happy day  my good master heard her  and said  you shall  you shall madam that s pure  said miss darnford he took me aside  and said softly  shall i lead them to the alcove and tell them there  or stay till we go in to dinner neither  sir  i think  said i  i fear i shan t stand it nay  said he  they must know it  i would not have invited them else why then  sir  said i  let it alone till they are going away then  replied he  you must pull off your ring  no  no  sir  said i  that i must not well  said he  do you tell miss darnford of it yourself indeed  sir  answered i  i cannot mrs  jewkes came officiously to ask my master  just then  if she should bring a glass of rhenish and sugar before dinner  for the gentlemen and ladies  and he said  that s well thought of  bring it  mrs  jewkes and she came  with nan attending her  with two bottles and glasses  and a salver  and must needs  making a low courtesy  offered first to me saying  will your ladyship begin  i coloured like scarlet  and said no my master  to be sure but they all took the hint  and miss darnford said  i ll be hanged if they have not stolen a wedding  said mrs  peters  it must certainly be so  ah  mr  peters i ll assure you  said he  i have not married them  where were you  said she  and mr  williams  last thursday morning  said sir simon  let me alone  let me alone  if any thing has been stolen  i ll find it out i m a justice of the peace  you know  and so he took me by the hand and said  come  madam  answer me  by the oath you have taken  are you married or not my master smiled  to see me look so like a fool  and i said  pray  sir simon ay  ay  said he  i thought you did not look so smirking upon us for nothing well  then  pamela  said my master  since your blushes discover you  don t be ashamed  but confess the truth now  said miss darnford  i am quite angry  and  said lady darnford  i am quite pleased  let me give you joy  dear madam  if it be so  and so they all said  and saluted me all round i was vexed it was before mrs jewkes  for she shook her fat sides  and seemed highly pleased to be a means of discovering it nobody  said my master  wishes me joy  no  said lady jones  very obligingly  nobody need  for  with such a peerless spouse  you want no good wishes and he saluted them  and when he came last to me  said before them all  now  my sweet bride  my pamela  let me conclude with you  for here i began to love  and here i desire to end loving  but not till my life ends this was sweetly said  and taken great notice of  and it was doing credit to his own generous choice  and vastly more than i merited but i was forced to stand many more jokes afterwards  for sir simon said  several times  come  come  madam  now you are become one of us  i shall be a little less scrupulous than i have been  i ll assure you when we came in to dinner  i made no difficulty of what all offered me the upper end of the table  and performed the honours of it with pretty tolerable presence of mind  considering  and  with much ado  my good benefactor promising to be down again before winter  we got off the ball  but appointed tuesday evening  at lady darnford s  to take leave of all this good company  who promised to be there  my master designing to set out on wednesday morning for bedfordshire we had prayers in the little chapel  in the afternoon  but they all wished for the good clerk again  with great encomiums upon you  my dear father  and the company staid supper also  and departed exceeding well satisfied  and with abundance of wishes for the continuance of our mutual happiness  and my master desired mr  peters to answer for him to the ringers at the town  if they should hear of it  till our return into this country  and that then he would be bountiful to them  because he would not publicly declare it till he had first done so in bedfordshire monday  the fifth day i have had very little of my dear friend s company this day  for he only staid breakfast with me  and rode out to see a sick gentleman about eighteen miles off  who begged by a man and horse on purpose  to speak with him  believing he should not recover  and upon part of whose estate my master has a mortgage  he said  my dearest  i shall be very uneasy if i am obliged to tarry all night from you  but  lest you should be alarmed  if i don t come home by ten  don t expect me  for poor mr carlton and i have pretty large concerns together  and if he should be very ill  and would be comforted by my presence  as i know he loves me and his family will be more in my power  if he dies  than i wish for charity will not let me refuse it is now ten o clock at night  and i fear he will not return  i fear for the sake of his poor sick friend  who  i doubt  is worse  though i know not the gentleman  i am sorry for his own sake  for his family s sake  and for my dear master s sake  who  by his kind expressions  i find  loves him  and  methinks  i should be sorry any grief should touch his generous heart  though yet there is no living in this world  without too many occasions for concern  even in the most prosperous state  and it is fit it should be so  or else  poor wretches  as we are  we should look no farther  but be like sensual travellers on a journey homeward who  meeting with good entertainment at some inn on the way  put up their rest there  and never think of pursuing their journey to their proper home this  i remember  was often a reflection of my good lady s  to whom i owe it eleven o clock mrs  jewkes has been with me  and asked if i will have her for a bed fellow  in want of a better  i thanked her  but i said  i would see how it was to be by myself one night i might have mentioned  that i made mrs  jewkes dine and sup with me and she was much pleased with it  and my behaviour to her  and i could see  by her manner  that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her former conduct to me  but  poor wretch  it is much  i fear  because i am what i am  for she has otherwise very little remorse i doubt  her talk and actions are entirely different from what they used to be  quite circumspect and decent  and i should have thought her virtuous  and even pious  had i never known her in another light by this we may see  my dear father and mother  of what force example is and what is in the power of the heads of families to do  and this shews that evil examples  in superiors  are doubly pernicious  and doubly culpable  because such persons are bad themselves  and not only do no good  but much harm to others  and the condemnation of such must  to be sure  be so much the greater and how much the greater still must my condemnation be  who have had such a religious education under you and been so well nurtured by my good lady  if i should forget  with all these mercies heaped upon me  what belongs to the station i am preferred to o how i long to be doing some good  for all that is past yet  is my dear  dear master s  god bless him  and return him safe to my wishes for methinks  already  tis a week since i saw him  if my love would not be troublesome and impertinent  i should be nothing else  for i have a true grateful spirit  and i had need to have such a one  for i am poor in every thing but will tuesday morning  eleven o clock my dear  dear master i m sure i should still say  but i will learn to rise to a softer epithet  now and then  is not yet come  i hope he is safe and well so mrs  jewkes and i went to breakfast  but i can do nothing but talk and think of him  and all his kindness to me  and to you  which is still me  more intimately i have just received a letter from him  which he wrote overnight  as i find by it  and sent early this morning  this is a copy of it to mrs  andrews my dearest pamela  monday night i hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you  you may believe i can t help it  my poor friend is so very ill  that i doubt he can t recover  his desires to have me stay with him are so strong  that i shall sit up all night with him  as it is now near one o clock in the morning  for he can t bear me out of his sight  and i have made him and his distressed wife and children so easy  in the kindest assurances i could give him of my consideration for him and them  that i am looked upon as the poor disconsolate widow  as she  i doubt  will soon be tells me  as their good angel  i could have wished we had not engaged to the good neighbourhood at sir simon s for to morrow night  but i am so desirous to set out on wednesday for the other house  that  as well as in return for the civilities of so many good friends  who will be there on purpose  i would not put it off  what i beg of you  therefore my dear  is  that you would go in the chariot to sir simon s  the sooner in the day the better  because you will be diverted with the company who all so much admire you  and i hope to join you there by your tea time in the afternoon  which will be better than going home  and returning with you  as it will be six miles difference to me  and i know the good company will excuse my dress  on the occasion  i count every hour of this little absence for a day  for i am  with the utmost sincerity                                  my dearest love  for ever yours  etc if you could go to dine with them  it will be a freedom that would be very pleasing to them  and the more  as they don t expect it i begin to have a little concern  lest his fatigue should be too great and for the poor sick gentleman and family  but told mrs  jewkes  that the least intimation of his choice should be a command to me  and so i would go to dinner there  and ordered the chariot to be got ready to carry me  when a messenger came up  just as i was dressed  to tell her she must come down immediately  i see at the window  that visitors are come  for there is a chariot and six horses  the company gone out of it and three footmen on horseback  and i think the chariot has coronets who can it be  i wonder but here i will stop  for i suppose i shall soon know good sirs  how unlucky this is  what shall i do here is lady davers come  her own self  and my kind protector a great  great many miles off mrs  jewkes  out of breath  comes and tells me this  and says she is inquiring for my master and me  she asked her  it seemed  naughty lady as she is  if i was whored yet  there s a word for a lady s mouth mrs  jewkes says  she knew not what to answer  and my lady said  she is not married  i hope  and said she  i said  no  because you have not owned it yet publicly  my lady said  that was well enough  said i  i will run away  mrs  jewkes  and let the chariot go to the bottom of the elm walk  and i will steal out of the door unperceived  but she is inquiring for you  madam  replied she  and i said you was within  but going out  and she said  she would see you presently  as soon as she could have patience  what did she call me  said i  the creature  madam i will see the creature  said she  as soon as i can have patience  ay but  said i  the creature won t let her  if she can help it pray  mrs  jewkes  favour my escape  for this once  for i am sadly frighted said she  i ll bid the chariot go down  as you order  and wait till you come  and i ll step down and shut the hall door  that you may pass unobserved  for she sits cooling herself in the parlour  over against the staircase  that s a good mrs  jewkes  said i  but who has she with her  her woman  answered she  and her nephew  but he came on horseback  and is going into the stables  and they have three footmen and i wish  said i  they were all three hundred miles off what shall i do so i wrote thus far  and wait impatiently to hear the coast is clear mrs  jewkes tells me i must come down  or she will come up  what does she call me now  said i  wench  madam  bid the wench come down to me and her nephew and her woman are with her said i  i can t go  and that s enough you might contrive it that i might get out  if you would indeed  madam  said she  i cannot  for i went to shut the door  and she bid me let it stand open  and there she sits over against the staircase  then  said i  i ll get out of the window  i think and fanned myself  for i am sadly frightened  laud madam  said she  i wonder you so much disturb yourself you re on the right side the hedge  i m sure  and i would not be so discomposed for any body  ay  said i  but who can help constitution  i dare say you would no more be so discomposed  that i can help it said she  indeed madam  if it was to me  i would put on an air as mistress of the house as you are  and go and salute her ladyship  and bid her welcome  ay  ay replied i  fine talking but how unlucky this is  your good master is not at home what answer shall i give her  said she  to her desiring to see you tell her  said i  i am sick a bed  i m dying  and must not be disturbed  i m gone out or any thing but her woman came up to me just as i had uttered this  and said  how do you do  mrs  pamela  my lady desires to speak to you  so i must go sure she won t beat me oh that my dear protector was at home well  now i will tell you all that happened in this frightful interview and very bad it was i went down  dressed as i was  and my gloves on  and my fan in my hand to be just ready to step into the chariot  when i could get away  and i thought all my trembling fits had been over now  but i was mistaken  for i trembled sadly  yet resolved to put on as good an air as i could so i went to the parlour  and said  making a very low courtesy  your servant  my good lady  and your servant again  said she  my lady  for i think you are dressed out like one a charming girl  though  said her rakish nephew  and swore a great oath dear aunt  forgive me  but i must kiss her  and was coming to me  and i said  forbear  uncivil gentleman  i won t be used freely  jackey  said my lady  sit down  and don t touch the creature she s proud enough already  there s a great difference in her air  i ll assure you  since i saw her last well  child  said she  sneeringly  how dost find thyself  thou rt mightily come on  of late i hear strange reports about thee thou rt almost got into fool s paradise  i doubt and wilt find thyself terribly mistaken in a little while  if thou thinkest my brother will disgrace his family  to humour thy baby face i see  said i  sadly vexed  her woman and nephew smiling by  your ladyship has no very important commands for me  and i beg leave to withdraw  beck  said she to her woman  shut the door  my young lady and i must not have done so soon where s your well mannered deceiver gone  child says she said i when your ladyship is pleased to speak intelligibly  i shall know how to answer well  but my dear child  said she  in drollery  don t be too pert neither  i beseech thee  thou wilt not find thy master s sister half so ready to take thy freedoms  as thy mannerly master is so  a little of that modesty and humility that my mother s waiting maid used to shew will become thee better than the airs thou givest thyself  since my mother s son has taught thee to forget thyself i would beg  said i  one favour of your ladyship  that if you would have me keep my distance  you will not forget your own degree why  suppose miss pert  i should forget my degree  wouldst thou not keep thy distance then if you  madam  said i  lessen the distance yourself  you will descend to my level  and make an equality  which i don t presume to think of  for i can t descend lower than i am at least in your ladyship s esteem did i not tell you  jackey  said she  that i should have a wit to talk to he  who swears like a fine gentleman at every word  rapped out an oath  and said  drolling  i think  mrs  pamela  if i may be so bold as to say so  you should know you are speaking to lady davers sir  said i  i hope there was no need of your information  and so i can t thank you for it  and am sorry you seem to think it wants an oath to convince me of the truth of it he looked more foolish than i  at this  if possible  not expecting such a reprimand and said  at last  why  mrs  pamela  you put me half out of countenance with your witty reproof sir  said i  you seem quite a fine gentleman  and it will not be easily done  i dare say how now  pert one  said my lady  do you know whom you talk to i think i do not  madam  replied i  and for fear i should forget myself more i ll withdraw  your ladyship s servant  said i  and was going  but she rose  and gave me a push  and pulled a chair  and  setting the back against the door  sat down in it well  said i  i can bear anything at your ladyship s hands  but i was ready to cry though  and i went  and sat down  and fanned myself  at the other end of the room her woman  who stood all the time  said softly  mrs  pamela  you should not sit in my lady s presence  and my lady  though she did not hear her said  you shall sit down  child  in the room where i am  when i give you leave so i stood up  and said  when your ladyship will hardly permit me to stand  one might be indulged to sit down  but i ask you  said she whither your master is gone  to one mr  carlton  madam  about eighteen miles off  who is very sick  and when does he come home this evening madam  and where are you going  to a gentleman s house in the town madam and how was you to go  in the chariot  madam why  you must be a lady in time  to be sure i believe you d become a chariot mighty well  child was you ever out in it with your master pray  your ladyship  said i  a little too pertly  perhaps  be pleased to ask half a dozen such questions together  because one answer may do for all why  bold face  said she  you ll forget your distance  and bring me to your level before my time i could no longer refrain tears  but said  pray your ladyship  let me ask what i have done  to be thus severely treated  i never did your ladyship any harm  and if you think i am deceived  as you was pleased to hint  i should be more entitled to your pity  than your anger she rose  and took me by the hand  and led me to her chair  and then sat down  and still holding my hand  said  why pamela  i did indeed pity you while i thought you innocent  and when my brother seized you  and brought you down hither  without your consent  i was concerned for you and i was still more concerned for you  and loved you  when i heard of your virtue and resistance  and your laudable efforts to get away from him  but when  as i fear  you have suffered yourself to be prevailed upon  and have lost your innocence  and added another to the number of the fools he has ruined  this shocked me a little  i cannot help shewing my displeasure to you madam  replied i  i must beg no hasty judgment  i have not lost my innocence take care  take care  pamela  said she  don t lose your veracity  as well as your honour why are you here  when you are at full liberty to go whither you please i will make one proposal to you and if you are innocent  i am sure you ll accept it  will you go and live with me i will instantly set out with you in my chariot  and not stay half an hour longer in this house  if you ll go with me now  if you are innocent  and willing to keep so  deny me  if you can i am innocent  madam  replied i  and willing to keep so  and yet i cannot consent to this  then  said she  very mannerly  thou liest child  that s all  and i give thee up and so she arose  and walked about the room in great wrath  her nephew and her woman said  your ladyship s very good  tis a plain case  a very plain case i would have removed the chair  to have gone out  but her nephew came and sat in it  this provoked me  for i thought i should be unworthy of the honour i was raised to  though i was afraid to own it  if i did not shew some spirit  and i said  what  sir  is your pretence in this house to keep me a prisoner here  because  said he i like it do you so sir  replied i  if that is the answer of a gentleman to such an one as i  it would not  i dare say  be the answer of a gentleman to a gentleman my lady  my lady  said he  a challenge  a challenge  by gad no  sir  said i  i am of a sex that gives no challenges  and you think so too  or you would not give this occasion for the word said my lady  don t be surprised  nephew  the wench could not talk thus if she had not been her master s bed fellow pamela  pamela  said she and tapped me upon the shoulder two or three times  in anger  thou hast lost thy innocence  girl  and thou hast got some of thy bold master s assurance  and art fit to go any where then  and please your ladyship said i  i am unworthy of your presence  and desire i may quit it no  replied she  i will know first what reason you can give for not accepting my proposal  if you are innocent  i can give  said i  a very good one  but i beg to be excused  i will hear it  said she  why  then answered i  i should perhaps have less reason to like this gentleman than where i am well then  said she  i ll put you to another trial  i ll set out this moment with you to your father and mother  and give you up safe to them what do you say to that ay  mrs  pamela  said her nephew  now what does your innocence say to that fore gad  madam  you have puzzled her now be pleased  madam  said i  to call off this fine gentleman  your kindness in these proposals makes me think you would not have me baited i ll be d d  said he  if she does not make me a bull dog  why she ll toss us all by and by  sir  said i  you indeed behave as if you were in a bear garden jackey  be quiet  said my lady  you only give her a pretence to evade my questions  come  answer me  pamela  i will  madam  said i  and it is thus  i have no occasion to be beholden to your ladyship for this honour  for i am to set out to morrow morning on the way to my parents now again thou liest  wench i am not of quality  said i  to answer such language once again  said she  provoke me not  by these reflections  and this pertness  if thou dost  i shall do something by thee unworthy of myself  that  thought i  you have done already  but i ventured not to say so  but who is to carry you  said she  to your father and mother  who my master pleases  madam  said i  ay  said she  i doubt not thou wilt do every thing he pleases  if thou hast not already why now tell me  pamela  from thy heart  hast thou not been in bed with thy master  ha  wench i was quite shocked at this  and said  i wonder how your ladyship can use me thus i am sure you can expect no answer and my sex  and my tender years  might exempt me from such treatment from a person of your ladyship s birth and quality  and who  be the distance ever so great  is of the same sex with me thou art a confident wench  said she  i see pray  madam  said i  let me beg you to permit me to go  i am waited for in the town  to dinner no  replied she  i can t spare you  and whomsoever you are to go to will excuse you  when they are told tis i that command you not to go and you may excuse it too  young lady would be  if you consider that it is the unexpected coming of your late lady s daughter  and your master s sister  that commands your stay but a pre engagement  your ladyship will consider  is something ay so it is  but i know not what reason waiting maids have to assume these airs of pre engagements  oh  pamela  pamela  i am sorry for thy thus aping thy betters  and giving thyself such airs  i see thou rt quite spoiled  of a modest  innocent girl  that thou wast  and humble too thou art now fit for nothing in the world  but what i fear thou art why  please your ladyship  said her kinsman  what signifies all you say the matter s over with her  no doubt  and she likes it  and she is in a fairy dream  and tis pity to awaken her before her dream s out bad as you take me to be  madam  said i  i am not used to such language or reflections as this gentleman bestows upon me  and i won t bear it well  jackey  said she  be silent  and  shaking her head  poor girl said she what a sweet innocence is here destroyed a thousand pities i could cry over her  if that would do her good  but she is quite lost  quite undone  and then has assumed a carriage upon it  that all those creatures are distinguished by i cried sadly for vexation  and said  say what you please  madam  if i can help it  i will not answer another word mrs  jewkes came in  and asked if her ladyship was ready for dinner  she said  yes  i would have gone out with her but my lady said  taking my hand  she could not spare me  and  miss  said she  you may pull off your gloves  and lay your fan by  for you shan t go  and  if you behave well you shall wait upon me at dinner  and then i shall have a little further talk with you mrs  jewkes said to me  madam  may i speak one word with you i can t tell  mrs  jewkes  said i  for my lady holds my hand  and you see i am a kind of prisoner what you have to say  mrs  jewkes  said she  you may speak before me but she went out  and seemed vexed for me  and she says  i looked like the very scarlet the cloth was laid in another parlour  and for three persons  and she led me in  come  my little dear  said she  with a sneer  i ll hand you in  and i would have you think it as well as if it was my brother what a sad case  thought i  should i be in  if i were as naughty as she thinks me  it was bad enough as it was jackey  said my lady  come  let us go to dinner  she said to her woman  do you  beck  help pamela to tend us  we will have no men fellows come  my young lady  shall i help you off with your white gloves  i have not  madam  said i  deserved this at your ladyship s hands mrs  jewkes  coming in with the first dish  she said  do you expect any body else  mrs  jewkes  that you lay the cloth for three  said she  i hoped your ladyship and madam would have been so well reconciled  that she would have sat down too what means the clownish woman  said my lady  in great disdain  could you think the creature should sit down with me  she does  madam  and please your ladyship  with my master i doubt it not  good woman  said she  and lies with him too  does she not answer me  fat face how these ladies are privileged if she does  madam  said she  there may be a reason for it  perhaps and went out so  said she  has the wench got thee over too  come my little dear  pull off thy gloves  i say  and off she pulled my left glove herself  and spied my ring  o my dear god  said she  if the wench has not got a ring well  this is a pretty piece of foolery  indeed dost know  my friend  that thou art miserably tricked  and so  poor innocent  thou hast made a fine exchange  hast thou not  thy honesty for this bauble  and  i ll warrant  my little dear has topped her part  and paraded it like any real wife  and so mimics still the condition why said she  and turned me round  thou art as mincing as any bride  no wonder thou art thus tricked out  and talkest of thy pre engagements pr ythee  child  walk before me to that glass  survey thyself  and come back to me  that i may see how finely thou can st act the theatrical part given thee i was then resolved to try to be silent  although most sadly vexed so i went and sat me down in the window  and she took her place at the upper end of the table  and her saucy jackey  fleering at me most provokingly  sat down by her  said he  shall not the bride sit down by us  madam  ay  well thought of  said my lady  pray  mrs  bride  your pardon for sitting down in your place i said nothing said she  with a poor pun  thou hast some modesty  however  child  for thou can st not stand it  so must sit down  though in my presence i still kept my seat  and said nothing thought i  this is a sad thing that i am hindered too from shewing my duty where it is most due  and shall have anger there too  may be  if my dear master should be there before me so she ate some soup  as did her kinsman  and then  as she was cutting up a fowl  said  if thou longest  my little dear  i will help thee to a pinion  or breast  or any thing  but may be  child  said he  thou likest the rump  shall i bring it thee  and then laughed like an idiot  for all he is a lord s son  and may be a lord himself for he is the son of lord  and his mother  who was lord davers s sister being dead  he has received what education he has  from lord davers s direction  poor wretch  for all his greatness  he ll ne er die for a plot at least of his own hatching  if i could then have gone up  i would have given you his picture  but  for one of  or  years of age much about the age of my dear master  he is a most odd mortal pamela  said my lady  help me to a glass of wine  no  beck  said she you shan t  for she was offering to do it  i will have my lady bride confer that honour upon me  and then i shall see if she can stand up  i was silent  and never stirred dost hear  chastity  said she  help me to a glass of wine  when i bid thee what  not stir  then i ll come and help thee to one  still i stirred not  and  fanning myself  continued silent  said she  when i have asked thee  meek one  half a dozen questions together  i suppose thou wilt answer them all at once  pretty creature  is not that it i was so vexed  i bit a piece of my fan out  not knowing what i did  but still i said nothing  and did nothing but flutter it  and fan myself i believe  said she  my next question will make up half a dozen  and then  modest one  i shall be entitled to an answer he rose and brought the bottle and glass  come  said he  mrs  bride  be pleased to help my lady  and i will be your deputy  sir  replied i  it is in a good hand  help my lady yourself why  creature  said she  dost thou think thyself above it and then flew into a passion insolence continued she  this moment  when i bid you  know your duty  and give me a glass of wine  or so i took a little spirit then thought i  i can but be beat if  said i  to attend your ladyship at table  or even kneel at your feet  was required of me  i would most gladly do it  were i only the person you think me  but  if it be to triumph over one who has received honours that she thinks require her to act another part  not to be utterly unworthy of them  i must say  i cannot do it she seemed quite surprised  and looked now upon her kinsman  and then upon her woman i m astonished quite astonished well  then  i suppose you would have me conclude you my brother s wife  could you not your ladyship  said i  compels me to say this well  returned she  but dost thou thyself think thou art so silence  said her kinsman  gives consent  tis plain enough she does  shall i rise  madam  and pay my duty to my new aunt tell me  said my lady  what  in the name of impudence  possesses thee to dare to look upon thyself as my sister madam  replied i  that is a question will better become your most worthy brother to answer  than me she was rising in great wrath  but her woman said  good your ladyship you ll do yourself more harm than her  and if the poor girl has been deluded so  as you have heard  with the sham marriage  she ll be more deserving of your ladyship s pity than anger  true  beck  very true said my lady  but there s no bearing the impudence of the creature in the mean time i would have gone out at the door  but her kinsman ran and set his back against it  i expected bad treatment from her pride  and violent temper but this was worse than i could have thought of  and i said to him  sir when my master comes to know your rude behaviour  you will  may be  have cause to repent it  and went and sat down in the window again another challenge  by gad  said he  but i am glad she says her master you see  madam  she herself does not believe she is married and so has not been so much deluded as you think for  and  coming to me with a most barbarous air of insult  he said  kneeling on one knee before me  my new aunt  your blessing or your curse  i care not which but quickly give me one or other  that i may not lose my dinner i gave him a most contemptuous look  tinselled toy  said i  for he was laced all over  twenty or thirty years hence  when you are at age  i shall know how to answer you better  mean time  sport with your footman and not with me  and so i removed to another window nearer the door  and he looked like a sad fool  as he is beck  beck  said my lady  this is not to be borne  was ever the like heard  is my kinsman and lord davers s to be thus used by such a slut and was coming to me  and indeed i began to be afraid  for i have but a poor heart  after all  but mrs  jewkes hearing high words  came in again  with the second course  and said  pray your ladyship  don t so discompose yourself  i am afraid this day s business will make matters wider than ever between your good ladyship and your brother  for my master doats upon madam woman  said she  do thou be silent  sure  i that was born in this house may have some privilege in it  without being talked to by the saucy servants in it i beg pardon  madam  replied mrs  jewkes  and  turning to me  said madam  my master will take it very ill if you make him wait for you thus  so i rose to go out  but my lady said  if it was only for that reason she shan t go and went to the door and shut it  and said to mrs  jewkes  woman  don t come again till i call you  and coming to me took my hand  and said  find your legs  miss  if you please i stood up  and she tapped my cheek  oh  says she  that scarlet glow shews what a rancorous little heart thou hast  if thou durst shew it but come this way  and so led me to her chair  stand there  said she and answer me a few questions while i dine  and i ll dismiss thee  till i call thy impudent master to account  and then i ll have you face to face  and all this mystery of iniquity shall be unravelled  for  between you  i will come to the bottom of it when she had sat down  i moved to the window on the other side of the parlour  looking into the private garden  and her woman said  mrs pamela  don t make my lady angry  stand by her ladyship  as she bids you  said i  pray  good now  let it suffice you to attend your lady s commands  and don t lay yours upon me your pardon  sweet mrs  pamela said she  times are much altered with you  i ll assure you  said i  her ladyship has a very good plea to be free in the house that she was born in  but you may as well confine your freedoms to the house in which you had your breedings  why  how now  mrs  pamela  said she  since you provoke me to it  i ll tell you a piece of my mind  hush  hush  good woman  said i  alluding to my lady s language to mrs  jewkes  my lady wants not your assistance besides  i can t scold the woman was ready to flutter with vexation  and lord jackey laughed as if he would burst his sides  g d d n me  beck  said he  you d better let her alone to my lady here for she ll be too many for twenty such as you and i and then he laughed again  and repeated i can t scold quoth a  but  by gad  miss  you can speak d d spiteful words  i can tell you that poor beck  poor beck fore gad  she s quite dumbfoundered well  but pamela  said my lady  come hither  and tell me truly  dost thou think thyself really married said i  and approached her chair  my good lady  i ll answer all your commands  if you ll have patience with me  and not be so angry as you are  but i can t bear to be used thus by this gentleman  and your ladyship s woman  child  said she  thou art very impertinent to my kinsman  thou can st not be civil to me  and my ladyship s woman is much thy betters  but that s not the thing dost thou think thou art really married i see  madam  said i  you are resolved not to be pleased with any answer i shall return  if i should say  i am not  then your ladyship will call me hard names  and  perhaps  i should tell a fib  if i should say  i am  your ladyship will ask  how i have the impudence to be so and will call it a sham marriage  i will  said she  be answered more directly why  what  madam  does it signify what i think  your ladyship will believe as you please but can st thou have the vanity  the pride  the folly  said she  to think thyself actually married to my brother  he is no fool  child  and libertine enough of conscience  and thou art not the first in the list of his credulous harlots well  well  said i  and was in a sad flutter  as i am easy  and pleased with my lot  pray  madam  let me continue so  as long as i can  it will be time enough for me to know the worst  when the worst comes  and if it should be so bad  your ladyship should pity me  rather than thus torment me before my time well  said she  but dost not think i am concerned  that a young wench whom my poor dear mother loved so well  should thus cast herself away and suffer herself to be deluded and undone  after such a noble stand as thou madst for so long a time i think myself far from being deluded and undone  and am as innocent and virtuous as ever i was in my life  thou liest  child  said she so your ladyship told me twice before she gave me a slap on the hand for this  and i made a low courtesy  and said  i humbly thank your ladyship  but i could not refrain tears  and added  your dear brother  madam  however  won t thank your ladyship for this usage of me  though i do  come a little nearer me  my dear  said she  and thou shalt have a little more than that to tell him of  if thou think st thou hast not made mischief enough already between a sister and brother  but  child  if he was here  i would serve thee worse  and him too  i wish he was  said i dost thou threaten me  mischief maker  and insolent as thou art now  pray  madam  said i  but got to a little distance  be pleased to reflect upon all that you have said to me  since i have had the honour or rather misfortune  to come into your presence  whether you have said one thing befitting your ladyship s degree to me  even supposing i was the wench and the creature you imagine me to be come hither  my pert dear  replied she  come but within my reach for one moment  and i ll answer thee as thou deservest to be sure she meant to box my ears  but i should not be worthy my happy lot if i could not shew some spirit when the cloth was taken away  i said  i suppose i may now depart your presence  madam  i suppose not  said she  why  i ll lay thee a wager child  thy stomach s too full to eat  and so thou may st fast till thy mannerly master comes home pray your ladyship  said her woman  let the poor girl sit down at table with mrs  jewkes and me said i  you are very kind  mrs  worden  but times  as you said  are much altered with me  and i have been of late so much honoured with better company  that i can t stoop to yours was ever such confidence  said my lady poor beck  poor beck  said her kinsman  why she beats you quite out of the pit will your ladyship said i  be so good as to tell me how long i am to tarry  for you ll please to see by that letter  that i am obliged to attend my master s commands  and so i gave her the dear gentleman s letter from mr carlton s  which i thought would make her use me better  as she might judge by it of the honour done me by him  ay  said she  this is my worthy brother s hand  it is directed to mrs  andrews  that s to you  i suppose  child  and so she ran on  making remarks as she went along  in this manner my dearest pamela mighty well i hope my not coming home this night  will not frighten you vastly tender  indeed and did it frighten you  child you may believe i can t help it  no  to be sure a person in thy way of life  is more tenderly used than an honest wife  but mark the end of it i could have wished pr ythee  jackey mind this we mind the significant we had not engaged to the good neighbourhood  at sir simon s  for to morrow night why  does the good neighbourhood  and does sir simon  permit thy visits  child  they shall have none of mine  then  i ll assure them but i am so desirous to set out on wednesday for the other house so  jackey  but we just nicked it  i find that  as well as in return for the civilities of so many good friends  who will be there on purpose  i would not put it off now mind  jackey what i beg of you mind the wretch  that could use me and your uncle as he has done  he is turned beggar to this creature i beg of you  therefore  my dear my dear  there s for you i wish i may not be quite sick before i get through what i beg of you  therefore  my dear  and then she looked me full in the face is  that you will go in the chariot to sir simon s  the sooner in the day the better dear heart  and why so  when we were not expected till night  why  pray observe the reason hem  said she because you will be diverted with the company mighty kind  indeed who all jackey jackey  mind this who all so much admire you  now he d ha  been hanged before he would have said so complaisant a thing  had he been married  i m sure very true  aunt  said he  a plain case that thought i  that s hard upon poor matrimony  though i hope my lady don t find it so  but i durst not speak out who all so much admire you  said she  i must repeat that pretty miss i wish thou wast as admirable for thy virtue  as for that baby face of thine and i hope to join you there by your tea time in the afternoon so  you re in very good time  child  an hour or two hence  to answer all your important pre engagements which will be better than going home  and returning with you  as it will be six miles difference to me  and i know the good company will excuse my dress on this occasion very true  any dress is good enough  i m sure  for such company as admire thee  child for a companion  in thy ruined state jackey  jackey  mind  mind again  more fine things still i count every hour of this little absence for a day there s for you  let me repeat it i count every hour of this little absence for a day mind  too  the wit of the good man  one may see love is a new thing to him  here is a very tedious time gone since he saw his deary  no less than  according to his amorous calculation  a dozen days and nights  at least  and yet  tedious as it is  it is but a little absence  well said  my good  accurate  and consistent brother but wise men in love are always the greatest simpletons but now cones the reason why this little absence  which  at the same time  is so great an absence  is so tedious for i am ay now for it with the utmost sincerity  my dearest love out upon dearest love  i shall never love the word again  pray bid your uncle never call me dearest love  jackey for ever yours but  brother thou liest thou knowest thou dost and so  my good lady andrews  or what shall i call you  your dearest love will be for ever yours  and hast thou the vanity to believe this but stay  here is a postscript the poor man knew not when to have done to his dearest love he s sadly in for t  truly  why  his dearest love  you are mighty happy in such a lover if you could go to dine with them cry you mercy  my dearest love  now comes the pre engagement it will be a freedom that will be very pleasing to them  and the more  as they don t expect it well  so much for this kind letter  but you see you cannot honour this admiring company with this little expected  and  but in complaisance to his folly  i dare say  little desired freedom  and i cannot forbear admiring you so much myself  my dearest love  that i will not spare you at all  this whole evening  for tis a little hard  if thy master s sister may not be blest a little bit with thy charming company so i found i had shewn her my letter to very little purpose  and repented it several times  as she read on well  then  said i  i hope your ladyship will give me leave to send my excuses to your good brother  and say  that your ladyship is come  and is so fond of me  that you will not let me leave you pretty creature  said she  and wantest thou thy good master to come  and quarrel with his sister on thy account but thou shalt not stir from my presence  and i would now ask thee  what it is thou meanest by shewing me this letter why  madam said i  to shew your ladyship how i was engaged for this day and evening and for nothing else  said she  why  i can t tell  madam  said i  but if you can collect from it any other circumstances  i might hope i should not be the worse treated i saw her eyes began to sparkle with passion  and she took my hand and said  grasping it very hard  i know  confident creature  that thou shewedst it me to insult me you shewed it me  to let me see  that he could be civiller to a beggar born  than to me  or to my good lord davers you shewed it me  as if you d have me to be as credulous a fool as yourself  to believe your marriage true  when i know the whole trick of it  and have reason to believe you do too  and you shewed it me  to upbraid me with his stooping to such painted dirt  to the disgrace of a family  ancient and untainted beyond most in the kingdom  and now will i give thee one hundred guineas for one bold word  that i may fell thee at my foot was not this very dreadful  to be sure  i had better have kept the letter from her  i was quite frightened and this fearful menace and her fiery eyes  and rageful countenance  made me lose all my courage so i said  weeping  good your ladyship  pity me indeed i am honest  indeed i am virtuous  indeed i would not do a bad thing for the world though i know  said she  the whole trick of thy pretended marriage  and thy foolish ring here  and all the rest of the wicked nonsense  yet i should not have patience with thee  if thou shouldst but offer to let me know thy vanity prompts thee to believe thou art married to my brother i could not bear the thought so take care  pamela  take care  beggarly brat  take care good madam  said i  spare my dear parents  they are honest and industrious  they were once in a very creditable way  and never were beggars  misfortunes may attend any body  and i can bear the cruellest imputations on myself  because i know my innocence  but upon such honest  industrious parents  who went through the greatest trials without being beholden to any thing but god s blessing  and their own hard labour  i cannot bear reflection what  art thou setting up for a family  creature as thou art  god give me patience with thee  i suppose my brother s folly  and his wickedness together  will  in a little while  occasion a search at the heralds office  to set out thy wretched obscurity  provoke me  i desire thou wilt  one hundred guineas will i give thee  to say but thou thinkest thou art married to my brother your ladyship  i hope  won t kill me  and since nothing i can say will please you  but your ladyship is resolved to quarrel with me  since i must not say what i think  on one hand nor another  whatever your ladyship designs by me  be pleased to do  and let me depart your presence she gave me a slap on the hand  and reached to box my ear  but mrs jewkes hearkening without  and her woman too  they both came in at that instant  and mrs  jewkes said  pushing herself in between us  your ladyship knows not what you do  indeed you don t  my master would never forgive me  if i suffered  in his house  one he so dearly loves  to be so used  and it must not be  though you are lady davers  her woman too interposed  and told her  i was not worth her ladyship s anger  but she was like a person beside herself i offered to go out  and mrs  jewkes took my hand to lead me out  but her kinsman set his back against the door  and put his hand to his sword  and said  i should not go  till his aunt permitted it  he drew it half way  and i was so terrified  that i cried out  oh  the sword the sword  and  not knowing what i did  i ran to my lady herself  and clasped my arms about her  forgetting  just then  how much she was my enemy  and said  sinking on my knees  defend me  good your ladyship  the sword  the sword mrs  jewkes said  oh  my lady will fall into fits but lady davers was herself so startled at the matter being carried so far  that she did not mind her words  and said  jackey  don t draw your sword you see  as great as her spirit is  she can t bear that come  said she  be comforted  he shan t frighten you i ll try to overcome my anger  and will pity you  so  wench  rise up  and don t be foolish  mrs  jewkes held her salts to my nose  and i did not faint  and my lady said  mrs  jewkes  if you would be forgiven  leave pamela and me by ourselves  and  jackey  do you withdraw  only you  beck  stay so i sat down in the window  all in a sad fluster  for  to be sure  i was sadly frightened said her woman  you should not sit in my lady s presence  mrs  pamela  yes  let her sit till she is a little recovered of her fright  said my lady  and do you set my chair by her  and so she sat over against me  and said  to be sure  pamela  you have been very provoking with your tongue  to be sure you have  as well upon my nephew who is a man of quality too  as me  and palliating her cruel usage and beginning  i suppose  to think herself she had carried it further than she could answer it to her brother  she wanted to lay the fault upon me  own  said she  you have been very saucy  and beg my pardon and beg jackey s pardon  and i will try to pity you  for you are a sweet girl  after all  if you had but held out  and been honest tis injurious to me  madam  said i  to imagine i am not honest said she  have you not been a bed with my brother  tell me that  your ladyship  replied i  asks your questions in a strange way  and in strange words o  your delicacy is wounded  i suppose  by my plain questions this niceness will soon leave you  wench  it will  indeed  but answer me directly  then your ladyship s next question  said i  will be  am i married  and you won t bear my answer to that and will beat me again i han t beat you yet  have i  beck  said she  so you want to make out a story  do you but  indeed  i can t bear thou shouldst so much as think thou art my sister  i know the whole trick of it  and so  tis my opinion  dost thou  it is only thy little cunning  that it might look like a cloak to thy yielding  and get better terms from him  pr ythee pr ythee  wench  thou seest i know the world a little almost as much at thirty two  as thou dost at sixteen remember that i rose from the window  and walking to the other end of the room  beat me again  if you please  said i  but i must tell your ladyship  i scorn your words  and am as much married as your ladyship at that she ran to me  but her woman interposed again  let the vain wicked creature go from your presence  madam  said she  she is not worthy to be in it  she will but vex your ladyship  stand away  beck said she  that s an assertion that i would not take from my brother  i can t bear it  as much married as i is that to be borne  but if the creature believes she is  madam  said her woman  she is to be as much pitied for her credulity  as despised for her vanity i was in hopes to have slipt out at the door  but she caught hold of my gown  and pulled me back  pray your ladyship  said i  don t kill me i have done no harm but she locked the door  and put the key in her pocket  so  seeing mrs  jewkes before the window  i lifted up the sash and said  mrs  jewkes  i believe it would be best for the chariot to go to your master  and let him know  that lady davers is here  and i cannot leave her ladyship she was resolved to be displeased  let me say what i would said she  no  no  he ll then think  that i make the creature my companion  and know not how to part with her  i thought your ladyship replied i  could not have taken exceptions at this message  thou knowest nothing  wench  said she  of what belongs to people of condition  how shouldst thou  nor  thought i  do i desire it  at this rate what shall i say  madam  said i  nothing at all  replied she  let him expect his dearest love  and be disappointed  it is but adding a few more hours  and he will make every one a day  in his amorous account mrs  jewkes coming nearer me  and my lady walking about the room  being then at the end  i whispered  let robert stay at the elms i ll have a struggle for t by and by as much married as i  repeated she the insolence of the creature and so she walked about the room  talking to herself  to her woman  and now and then to me  but seeing i could not please her  i thought i had better be silent  and then it was  am i not worthy an answer  if i speak  said i  your ladyship is angry at me  though ever so respectfully  if i do not  i cannot please  would your ladyship tell me but how i shall oblige you  and i would do it with all my heart confess the truth  said she  that thou art an undone creature  hast been in bed with thy master  and art sorry for it  and for the mischief thou hast occasioned between him and me  and then i ll pity thee  and persuade him to pack thee off  with a hundred or two of guineas  and some honest farmer may take pity of thee  and patch up thy shame  for the sake of the money  and if nobody will have thee  thou must vow penitence  and be as humble as i once thought thee i was quite sick at heart  at all this passionate extravagance  and to be hindered from being where was the desire of my soul  and afraid too of incurring my dear master s displeasure  and  as i sat  i saw it was no hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard  the parlour being even with the yard  and so have a fair run for it  and after i had seen my lady at the other end of the room again  in her walks  having not pulled down the sash  when i spoke to mrs  jewkes  i got upon the seat  and whipped out in a minute  and ran away as hard as i could drive  my lady calling after me to return  and her woman at the other window  but two of her servants appearing at her crying out  and she bidding them to stop me  i said  touch me at your peril  fellows but their lady s commands would have prevailed on them  had not mr colbrand  who  it seems  had been kindly ordered  by mrs  jewkes  to be within call  when she saw how i was treated  come up  and put on one of his deadly fierce looks  the only time  i thought  it ever became him and said  he would chine the man  that was his word  who offered to touch his lady  and so he ran alongside of me  and i heard my lady say the creature flies like a bird  and  indeed  mr  colbrand  with his huge strides  could hardly keep pace with me  and i never stopped  till i got to the chariot  and robert had got down  seeing me running at a distance  and held the door in his hand  with the step ready down  and in i jumped  without touching the step  saying  drive me  drive me  as fast as you can  out of my lady s reach  and he mounted  and colbrand said  don t be frightened  madam  nobody shall hurt you and shut the door  and away robert drove  but i was quite out of breath  and did not recover it  and my fright  all the way mr  colbrand was so kind  but i did not know it till the chariot stopped at sir simon s  to step up behind the carriage  lest  as he said  my lady should send after me  and he told mrs  jewkes  when he got home that he never saw such a runner as me in his life when the chariot stopped  which was not till six o clock  so long did this cruel lady keep me  miss darnford ran out to me  o madam  said she ten times welcome  but you ll be beat  i can tell you  for here has been mr  b  come these two hours  and is very angry with you that s hard indeed  said i indeed i can t afford it for i hardly knew what i said  having not recovered my fright  let me sit down  miss any where  said i  for i have been sadly off  so i sat down  and was quite sick with the hurry of my spirits  and leaned upon her arm said she  your lord and master came in very moody  and when he had staid an hour  and you not come  he began to fret  and said  he did not expect so little complaisance from you  and he is now sat down  with great persuasion  to a game at loo come  you must make your appearance  lady fair  for he is too sullen to attend you  i doubt you have no strangers  have you miss  said i only two women relations from stamford  replied she  and an humble servant of one of them only all the world  miss  said i what shall i do  if he be angry  i can t bear that just as i had said so  came in lady darnford and lady jones to chide me as they said  for not coming sooner  and before i could speak  came in my dear master  i ran to him  how dy e pamela  said he  and saluting me with a little more formality than i could well bear i expected half a word from me  when i was so complaisant to your choice  would have determined you  and that you d have been here to dinner and the rather  as i made my request a reasonable one  and what i thought would be agreeable to you  o dear sir  said i  pray  pray  hear me  and you ll pity me  and not be displeased  mrs  jewkes will tell you  that as soon as i had your kind commands  i said  i would obey you  and come to dinner with these good ladies  and so prepared myself instantly  with all the pleasure in the world  lady darnford and miss said i was their dear look you  said miss  did i not tell you  stately one  that something must have happened  but  o these tyrants  these men why  what hindered it  my dear  said he  give yourself time  you seem out of breath o sir  said i  out of breath  well i may for  just as i was ready to come away  who should drive into the court yard  but lady davers lady davers  nay  then  my sweet dear  said he  and saluted me more tenderly  hast thou had a worse trial than i wish thee  from one of the haughtiest women in england  though my sister for  she too  my pamela  was spoiled by my good mother but have you seen her yes  sir  said i  and more than seen her why sure  said he  she has not had the insolence to strike my girl sir  said i  but tell me you forgive me  for indeed i could not come sooner  and these good ladies but excuse me  and i ll tell you all another time  for to take up the good company s attention now  will spoil their pleasantry  and be to them  though more important to me  like the broken china you cautioned me about that s a dear girl  said he  i see my hints are not thrown away upon you  and i beg pardon for being angry with you  and  for the future will stay till i hear your defence  before i judge you  said miss darnford  this is a little better  to own a fault is some reparation and what every lordly husband will not do  he said  but tell me  my dear  did lady davers offer you any incivility  o sir  replied i  she is your sister  and i must not tell you all  but she has used me very severely  did you tell her  said he  you were married  yes  sir  i did at last  but she will have it tis a sham marriage  and that i am a vile creature  and she was ready to beat me  when i said so  for she could not have patience  that i should be deemed her sister  as she said how unlucky it was  replied he  i was not at home why did you not send to me here  send  sir  i was kept prisoner by force  they would not let me stir  or do you think i would have been hindered from obeying you nay  i told them  that i had a pre engagement  but she ridiculed me  and said  waiting maids talk of pre engagements  and then i shewed her your kind letter  and she made a thousand remarks upon it  and made me wish i had not  in short  whatever i could do or say  there was no pleasing her  and i was a creature and wench  and all that was naught  but you must not be angry with her on my account well  but  said he  i suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her  for she came before dinner  i presume  if it was soon after you had received my letter  no  sir  dine with my lady  no  indeed  why  she would make me wait at table upon her  with her woman  because she would not expose herself and me before the men servants  which you know  sir  was very good of her ladyship well  said he  but did you wait upon her  would you have had me sir  said i only  pamela  replied he  if you did  and knew not what belonged to your character  as my wife  i shall be very angry with you sir  said i  i did not  but refused it  out of consideration to the dignity you have raised me to  else  sir  i could have waited on my knees upon your sister now  said he  you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment  she is an insolent woman  and shall dearly repent it  but  sir  she is to be excused  because she won t believe i am indeed married  so don t be too angry at her ladyship he said  ladies  pray don t let us keep you from the company  i ll only ask a question or two more  and attend you  said lady jones  i so much long to hear this story of poor madam s persecution  that  if it was not improper  i should be glad to stay  miss darnford would stay for the same reason  my master saying  he had no secrets to ask  and that it was kind of them to interest themselves in my grievances but lady darnford went into the company  and told them the cause of my detention  for  it seems  my dear master loved me too well  to keep to himself the disappointment my not being here to receive him  was to him  and they had all given the two misses boroughs and mr  perry the stamford guests  such a character of me  that they said they were impatient to see me said my master  but  pamela  you said they and them  who had my sister with her besides her woman  her nephew  sir  and three footmen on horseback  and she and her woman were in her chariot and six that s a sad coxcomb  said he  how did he behave to you not extraordinarily  sir  but i should not complain  for i was even with him  because i thought i ought not to bear with him as with my lady by heaven  said he  if i knew he behaved unhandsomely to my jewel  i d send him home to his uncle without his ears  indeed  sir  returned i i was as hard upon him as he was upon me  said he  tis kind to say so but i believe i shall make them dearly repent their visit  if i find their behaviour to call for my resentment but  sure  my dear  you might have got away when you went to your own dinner  indeed  sir  said i  her ladyship locked me in  and would not let me stir so you ha nt ate any dinner  no  indeed  sir  nor had a stomach for any  my poor dear  said he  but then  how got you away at last  o sir  replied i  i jumped out of the parlour window  and ran away to the chariot  which had waited for me several hours  by the elm walk from the time of my lady s coming for i was just going  as i said  and mr  colbrand conducted me through her servants  whom she called to  to stop me  and was so kind to step behind the chariot  unknown to me  and saw me safe here i m sure  said he  these insolent creatures must have treated you vilely  but tell me  what part did mrs  jewkes act in this affair  a very kind part  sir  said i  in my behalf  and i shall thank her for it sweet creature  said he  thou lovest to speak well of every body  but i hope she deserves it  for she knew you were married but come  we ll now join the company  and try to forget all you have suffered  for two or three hours  that we may not tire the company with our concerns and resume the subject as we go home  and you shall find i will do you justice  as i ought  but you forgive me  sir  said i  and are not angry forgive you  my dear  returned he i hope you forgive me  i shall never make you satisfaction for what you have suffered from me  and for me and with those words he led me into the company he very kindly presented me to the two stranger ladies  and the gentleman  and them to me  and sir simon  who was at cards  rose from table  and saluted me  adad  madam  said he  i m glad to see you here what  it seems you have been a prisoner  twas well you was  or your spouse and i should have sat in judgment upon you  and condemned you to a fearful punishment for your first crime of laesae majestatis  i had this explained to me afterwards  as a sort of treason against my liege lord and husband  for we husbands hereabouts  said he  are resolved to turn over a new leaf with our wives  and your lord and master shall shew us the way  i can tell you that  but i see by your eyes  my sweet culprit  added he  and your complexion  you have had sour sauce to your sweet meat miss darnford said  i think we are obliged to our sweet guest  at last for she was forced to jump out at a window to come to us  indeed  said mrs  peters and my master s back being turned  says she  lady davers when a maiden  was always vastly passionate  but a very good lady when her passion was over  and she d make nothing of slapping her maids about  and begging their pardons afterwards  if they took it patiently otherwise she used to say the creatures were even with her ay  said i  i have been a many creatures and wenches  and i know not what  for these were the names she gave me  and i thought i ought to act up to the part her dear brother has given me  and so i have but just escaped a good cuffing miss boroughs said to her sister  as i overheard  but she did not design i should  what a sweet creature is this  and then she takes so little upon her  is so free  so easy  and owns the honour done her  so obligingly  said mr  perry  softly  the loveliest person i ever saw  who could have the heart to be angry with her one moment says miss darnford  here  my dearest neighbour  these gentry are admiring you strangely  and mr  perry says  you are the loveliest lady he ever saw  and he says it to his own mistress s face too  i ll assure you or else  says miss boroughs  i should think he much flattered me o  madam  you are exceedingly obliging  but your kind opinion ought to teach me humility  and to reverence so generous a worth as can give a preference against yourself  where it is so little due  indeed  madam said miss nanny boroughs  i love my sister well  but it would be a high compliment to any lady  to be deemed worthy a second or third place after you there is no answering such politeness  said i  i am sure lady davers was very cruel to keep me from such company  twas our loss  madam  says miss darnford  i ll allow it  said i  in degree  for you have all been deprived  several hours  of an humble admirer mr  perry said  i never before saw so young a lady shine forth with such graces of mind and person  alas  sir  said i  my master coming up  mine is but a borrowed shine  like that of the moon  here is the sun  to whose fervent glow of generosity i owe all the faint lustre  that your goodness is pleased to look upon with so much kind distinction mr  perry was pleased to hold up his hands  and the ladies looked upon one another  and my master said  hearing part of the last sentence what s the pretty subject  that my pamela is displaying so sweetly her talents upon oh  sir  said mr  perry  i will pronounce you the happiest man in england  and so said they all my master said  most generously  thank ye  thank ye  thank ye  all round  my dear friends  i know not your subject  but if you believe me so  for a single instance of this dear girl s goodness  what must i think myself  when blessed with a thousand instances  and experiencing it in every single act and word  i do assure you my pamela s person all lovely as you see it  is far short of her mind  that  indeed first attracted my admiration  and made me her lover  but they were the beauties of her mind  that made me her husband  and proud  my sweet dear  said he  pressing my hand  am i of that title well  said mr  perry  very kindly and politely  excellent as your lady is  i know not the gentleman that could deserve her  but that one who could say such just and such fine things i was all abashed  and took miss darnford s hand  and said  save me dear miss  by your sweet example  from my rising pride  but could i deserve half these kind things  what a happy creature should i be  said miss darnford  you deserve them all  indeed you do the greatest part of the company having sat down to loo  my master being pressed  said he would take one game at whist  but had rather be excused too  having been up all night  and i asked how his friend did  we ll talk of that  said he  another time  which  and his seriousness  made me fear the poor gentleman was dead  as it proved we cast in  and miss boroughs and my master were together  and mr  perry and i  and i had all four honours the first time  and we were up at one deal  said my master  an honourable hand  pamela  should go with an honourable heart  but you d not have been up  if a knave had not been one  whist  sir  said mr  perry  you know  was a court game originally and the knave  i suppose  signified always the prime minister tis well  said my master  if now there is but one knave in a court  out of four persons  take the court through the king and queen  sir  said mr  perry  can do no wrong  you know  so there are two that must be good out of four  and the ace seems too plain a card to mean much hurt we compliment the king  said my master  in that manner  and tis well to do so  because there is something sacred in the character  but yet  if force of example be considered  it is going a great way  for certainly a good master makes a good servant  generally speaking one thing  added he  i will say  in regard to the ace  i have always looked upon that plain and honest looking card in the light you do  and have considered whist as an english game in its original  which has made me fonder of it than of any other  for by the ace i have always thought the laws of the land denoted  and as the ace is above the king or queen and wins them  i think the law should be thought so too  though  may be i shall be deemed a whig for my opinion i shall never play whist  said mr  perry  without thinking of this and shall love the game the better for the thought  though i am no party man  nor i  said my master  for i think the distinctions of whig and tory odious  and love the one or the other only as they are honest and worthy men  and have never nor never shall  hope  given a vote  but according to what i thought was for the public good  let either whig or tory propose it i wish  sir  replied mr  perry  all gentlemen in your station would act so  if there was no undue influence  said my master  i am willing to think so well of all mankind  that i believe they generally would but you see  said he  by my pamela s hand  when all the court cards get together  and are acted by one mind  the game is usually turned accordingly  though now and then  too  it may be so circumstanced  that honours will do them no good  and they are forced to depend altogether upon tricks i thought this way of talking prettier than the game itself  but i said  though i have won the game  i hope i am no trickster  no  said my master  god forbid but court cards should sometimes win with honour  but you see  for all that  your game is as much owing to the knave as the king  and you  my fair one  lost no advantage  when it was put into your power else  sir  said i  i should not have done justice to my partner  you are certainly right  pamela  replied he  though you thereby beat your husband  sir  said i  you may be my partner next  and i must do justice you know  well  said he  always choose so worthy a friend  as chance has given you for a partner  and i shall never find fault with you  do what you will mr  perry said  you are very good to me  sir  and miss boroughs  i observed  seemed pleased with the compliment to her humble servant  by which i saw she esteemed him  as he appears to deserve  dear sir  said i  how much better is this  than to be locked in by lady davers the supper was brought in sooner on my account  because i had had no dinner  and there passed very agreeable compliments on the occasion lady darnford would help me first  because i had so long fasted  as she said  sir simon would have placed himself next me  and my master said he thought it was best  where there was an equal number of ladies and gentlemen  that they should sit  intermingled  that the gentlemen might be employed in helping and serving the ladies  lady darnford said she hoped sir simon would not sit above any ladies at his own table especially  well  said he  i shall sit over against her  however  and that s as well my dearest sir could not keep his eyes off me  and seemed generously delighted with all i did  and all i said  and every one was pleased to see his kind and affectionate behaviour to me lady jones brought up the discourse about lady davers again  and my master said  i fear  pamela  you have been hardly used  more than you ll say  i know my sister s passionate temper too well  to believe she could be over civil to you  especially as it happened so unluckily that i was out  if  added he  she had no pique to you  my dear  yet what has passed between her and me  has so exasperated her  that i know she would have quarrelled with my horse  if she had thought i valued it  and nobody else was in her way  dear sir  said i  don t say so of good lady davers why  my dear  said he  i know she came on purpose to quarrel  and had she not found herself under a very violent uneasiness  after what had passed between us  and my treatment of her lord s letter  she would not have offered to come near me  what sort of language had she for me pamela  o sir  very good  only her well mannered brother  and such as that only  said he  tis taking up the attention of the company disagreeably or i could tell you almost every word she said  lady jones wished to hear a further account of my lady s conduct  and most of the company joined with her  particularly mrs  peters  who said  that as they knew the story  and lady davers s temper  though she was very good in the main  they could wish to be so agreeably entertained  if he and i pleased  because they imagined i should have no difficulties after this tell me  then  pamela  said he  did she lift up her hand at you  did she strike you  but i hope not  a little slap of the hand  said i  or so insolent woman  she did not  i hope  offer to strike your face why  said i  i was a little saucy once or twice  and she would have given me a cuff on the ear  if her woman and mrs  jewkes had not interposed  why did you not come out at the door  because  said i her ladyship sat in the chair against it  one while  and another while locked it  else i offered several times to get away she knew i expected you here  you say  you shewed her my letter to you  yes  sir  said i  but i had better not  for she as then more exasperated  and made strange comments upon it  i doubt it not  said he but  did she not see  by the kind epithets in it  that there was no room to doubt of our being married  o  sir  replied i  and made the company smile  she said  for that very reason she was sure i was not married that s like my sister  said he  exactly like her  and yet she lives very happily herself  for her poor lord never contradicts her  indeed he dares not you were a great many wenches  were you not  my dear  for that s a great word with her yes  sir  said i  wenches and creatures out of number and worse than all that  what  tell me  my dear  sir  said i  i must not have you angry with lady davers  while you are so good to me  tis all nothing  only the trouble i have that i cannot be suffered to shew how much i honoured her ladyship  as your sister well  said he  you need not be afraid to tell me  i must love her after all  though i shall not be pleased with her on this occasion  i know it is her love for me  though thus oddly expressed  that makes her so uneasy  and  after all  she comes  i m sure  to be reconciled to me though it must be through a good hearty quarrel first  for she can shew a good deal of sunshine  but it must be always after a storm  and i ll love her dearly  if she has not been  and will not be  too hard upon my dearest mr  peters said  sir  you are very good  and very kind  i love to see this complaisance to your sister  though she be in fault  so long as you can shew it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit in the world  by all that s good  mr  peters  said he  i d present my sister with a thousand pounds  if she would kindly take my dear pamela by the hand  and wish her joy  and call her sister and yet i should be unworthy of the dear creature that smiles upon me there  if it was not principally for her sake  and the pleasure it would give her  that i say this  for i will never be thoroughly reconciled to my sister till she does  for i most sincerely think  as to myself  that my dear wife  there she sits  does me more honour in her new relation  than she receives from me sir  said i  i am overwhelmed with your goodness and my eyes were filled with tears of joy and gratitude  and all the company with one voice blessed him  and lady jones was pleased to say  the behaviour of you two happy ones  to each other  is the most edifying i ever knew  i am always improved when i see you  how happy would every good lady be with such a gentleman  and every good gentleman with such a lady in short  you seem made for one another o madam  said i  you are so kind  so good to me  that i know not how to thank you enough said she  you deserve more than i can express  for to all that know your story  you are a matchless person  you are an ornament to our sex and your virtue  though mr  b  is so generous as he is  has met with no more than its due reward  god long bless you together you are  said my dearest sir  very good to me  madam  i am sure  i have taken liberties in my former life  that deserved not so much excellence i have offended extremely  by trials glorious to my pamela  but disgraceful to me  against a virtue that i now consider as almost sacred  and i shall not think i deserve her  till i can bring my manners  my sentiments  and my actions  to a conformity with her own in short  my pamela  continued he  i want you to be nothing but what you are  and have been  you cannot be better  and if you could  it would be but filling me with despair to attain the awful heights of virtue at which you have arrived  perhaps  added the dear gentleman  the scene i have beheld within these twelve hours  has made me more serious than otherwise i should have been  but i ll assure you  before all this good company  i speak the sentiments of my heart  and those not of this day only what a happy daughter is yours  o my dear father and mother  i owe it all to god s grace  and to yours and my good lady s instructions  and to these let me always look back with grateful acknowledgments  that i may not impute to myself  and be proud  my inexpressible happiness the company were so kindly pleased with our concern  and my dear master s goodness  that he  observing their indulgence  and being himself curious to know the further particulars of what had passed between my lady and me  repeated his question  what she had called me besides wench and creature  and i said  my lady  supposing i was wicked lamented over me  very kindly  my depravity and fall  and said  what a thousand pities it was  so much virtue  as she was pleased to say  was so destroyed  and that i had yielded  after so noble a stand  as she said excuse me  gentlemen and ladies  said i  you know my story  it seems and i am commanded  by one who has a title to all my obedience  to proceed they gave all of them bows of approbation  that they might not interrupt me  and i continued my story the men servants withdrawing  at a motion of mr  b  on my looking towards them  and then  at lady darnford s coming in  i proceeded i told her ladyship  that i was still innocent  and would be so  and it was injurious to suppose me otherwise  why  tell me  wench  said she but i think i must not tell you what she said  yes  do  said my master  to clear my sister  we shall think it very bad else i held my hand before my face why  she said  tell me  wench  hast thou not been hesitating a very free creature with thy master  that she said  or to that effect and when i said  she asked strange questions and in strange words  she ridiculed my delicacy  as she called it  and said  my niceness would not last long  she said  i must know i was not really married  that my ring was only a sham  and all was my cunning to cloak my yielding  and get better terms  she said  she knew the world as much at thirty two  as i did at sixteen  and bid me remember that i took the liberty to say  but i got a good way off  that i scorned her ladyship s words  and was as much married as her ladyship  and then i had certainly been cuffed  if her woman had not interposed  and told her i was not worthy her anger  and that i was as much to be pitied for my credulity  as despised for my vanity my poor pamela  said my master  this was too  too hard upon you  o sir said i  how much easier it was to me than if it had been so that would have broken my heart quite for then i should have deserved it all  and worse  and these reproaches  added to my own guilt  would have made me truly wretched lady darnford  at whose right hand i sat  kissed me with a kind of rapture  and called me a sweet exemplar for all my sex  mr  peters said very handsome things  so did mr  perry and sir simon  with tears in his eyes  said to my master  why  neighbour  neighbour  this is excellent by my troth  i believe there is something in virtue  that we had not well considered  on my soul  there has been but one angel come down for these thousand years  and you have got her well  my dearest  said my master  pray proceed with your story until  we have done supper  since the ladies seem pleased with it  why  sir  said i  her ladyship went on in the same manner  but said  one time  and held me by the hand  she would give me an hundred guineas for one provoking word  or  if i would but say i believed myself married  that she might fell me at her foot  but  sir  you must not be angry with her ladyship  she called me painted dirt  baby face  waiting maid  beggar s brat  and beggar born  but i said  as long as i knew my innocence  i was easy in every thing  but to have my dear parents abused  they were never beggars  nor beholden to any body  nor to any thing but god s grace and their own labour  that they once lived in credit  that misfortunes might befall any body  and that i could not bear they should be treated so undeservedly then her ladyship said  ay  she supposed my master s folly would make us set up for a family  and that the heralds  office would shortly be searched to make it out exactly my sister again  said he  so you could not please her any way no  indeed  sir  when she commanded me to fill her a glass of wine and would not let her woman do it  she asked  if i was above it  i then said  if to attend your ladyship at table  or even kneel at your feet was required of me  i would most gladly do it  were i only the person you think me  but if it be to triumph over one  who has received honours which she thinks require from her another part  that she may not be utterly unworthy of them  i must say  i cannot do it  this quite astonished her ladyship  and a little before  her kinsman brought me the bottle and glass  and required me to fill it for my lady  at her command  and called himself my deputy  and i said  tis in a good hand help my lady yourself  so  sir  added i  you see i could be a little saucy upon occasion you please me well  my pamela  said he  this was quite right  but proceed her ladyship said  she was astonished  adding  she supposed i would have her look upon me as her brother s wife  and asked me  what  in the name of impudence  possessed me  to dare to look upon myself as her sister and i said  that was a question better became her most worthy brother to answer  than me  and then i thought i should have had her ladyship upon me  but her woman interposed i afterwards told mrs  jewkes  at the window  that since i was hindered from going to you  i believed it was best to let robert go with the chariot  and say  lady davers was come  and i could not leave her ladyship  but this did not please  and i thought it would too  for she said  no  no  he ll think i make the creature my companion  and know not how to part with her exactly  said he  my sister again and she said  i knew nothing what belonged to people of condition  how should i what shall i say  madam  said i  nothing at all  answered she  let him expect his dearest love  alluding to your kind epithet in your letter  and be disappointed  it is but adding a few more hours to this heavy absence  and every one will become a day in his amorous account so  to be short  i saw nothing was to be done  and i feared  sir  you would wonder at my stay  and be angry  and i watched my opportunity till my lady  who was walking about the room  was at the further end and the parlour being a ground floor  in a manner  i jumped out at the window  and ran for it her ladyship called after me  so did her woman  and i heard her say  i flew like a bird  and she called two of her servants in sight to stop me  but i said  touch me at your peril  fellows  and mr  colbrand having been planted at hand by mrs  jewkes  who was very good in the whole affair  and incurred her ladyship s displeasure  once or twice  by taking my part  seeing how i was used  put on a fierce look  cocked his hat with one hand  and put t other on his sword  and said  he would chine the man who offered to touch his lady  and so he ran alongside of me  and could hardly keep pace with me and here  my dear sir concluded i  i am  at yours and the good company s service they seemed highly pleased with my relation  and my master said  he was glad mrs  jewkes behaved so well  as also mr  colbrand  yes  sir  said i  when mrs  jewkes interposed once  her ladyship said  it was hard she  who was born in that house  could not have some privilege in it  without being talked to by the saucy servants  and she called her another time fat face  and womaned her most violently well  said my master  i am glad  my dear  you have had such an escape my sister was always passionate  as mrs  peters knows  and my poor mother had enough to do with us both  for we neither of us wanted spirit  and when i was a boy  i never came home from school or college for a few days  but though we longed to see one another before  yet ere the first day was over  we had a quarrel  for she  being seven years older than i  was always for domineering over me  and i could not bear it  and i used  on her frequently quarrelling with the maids  and being always at a word and a blow  to call her captain bab  for her name is barbara  and when my lord davers courted her  my poor mother has made up quarrels between them three times in a day  and i used to tell her  she would certainly beat her husband  marry whom she would  if he did not beat her first  and break her spirit yet has she  continued he  very good qualities  she was a dutiful daughter  is a good wife  she is bountiful to her servants  firm in her friendships  charitable to the poor  and  i believe  never any sister better loved a brother  than she me  and yet she always loved to vex and tease me  and as i would bear a resentment longer than she  she d be one moment the most provoking creature in the world  and the next would do any thing to be forgiven  and i have made her  when she was the aggressor  follow me all over the house and garden to be upon good terms with me but this case piques her more  because she had found out a match for me in the family of a person of quality  and had set her heart upon bringing it to effect  and had even proceeded far in it  without my knowledge  and brought me into the lady s company  unknowing of her design  but i was then averse to matrimony upon any terms  and was angry at her proceeding in it so far without my privity or encouragement  and she cannot  for this reason  bear the thoughts of my being now married and to her mother s waiting maid too  as she reminds my dear pamela when i had declined her proposal with the daughter of a noble earl this is the whole case  said he  and  allowing for the pride and violence of her spirit  and that she knows not  as i do  the transcendent excellencies of my dear pamela  and that all her view  in her own conception  is mine and the family honour  she is a little to be allowed for  though  never fear  my pamela  but that i  who never had a struggle with her  wherein i did not get the better  will do you justice  and myself too this account of lady davers pleased every body  and was far from being to her ladyship s disadvantage in the main  and i would do any thing in the world to have the honour to be in her good graces  yet i fear it will not be easily  if at all  effected  but i will proceed after supper  nothing would serve miss darnford and miss boroughs  but we must have a dance  and mr  peters  who plays a good fiddle  urged it forward  my dear master  though in a riding dress  took out miss boroughs sir simon  for a man of his years  danced well  and took me out  but put on one of his free jokes  that i was fitter to dance with a younger man  and he would have it  though i had not danced since my dear lady s death to signify  except once or twice to please mrs  jervis  and indeed  believed all my dancing days over  that as my master and i were the best dancers  we should dance once together  before folks  as the odd gentleman said  and my dear sir was pleased to oblige him  and afterwards danced with miss darnford  who has much more skill and judgment than i  though they compliment me with an easier shape and air we left the company with great difficulty at about eleven  my dear master having been up all night before  and we being at the greatest distance from home  though they seemed inclinable not to break up so soon  as they were neighbours  and the ladies said  they longed to hear what would be the end of lady davers s interview with her brother my master said  he feared we must not now think of going next day to bedfordshire  as we had intended  and perhaps might see them again  and so we took leave  and set out for home  where we arrived not till twelve o clock  and found lady davers had gone to bed about eleven  wanting sadly that we should come home first  but so did not i mrs  jewkes told us  that my lady was sadly fretted that i had got away so  and seemed a little apprehensive of what i would say of the usage i had received from her  she asked mrs  jewkes  if she thought i was really married  and mrs  jewkes telling her yes  she fell into a passion  and said  begone  bold woman  i cannot bear thee  see not my face till i send for thee  thou hast been very impudent to me once or twice to day already  and art now worse than ever  she said  she would not have told her ladyship  if she had not asked her  and was sorry she had offended she sent for her at supper time  said she  i have another question to ask thee  woman  and tell me yes  if thou darest  was ever any thing so odd why then  said mrs  jewkes  i will say no  before your ladyship speaks my master laughed  poor woman  said he she called her insolent  and assurance  and said  begone  bold woman as thou art but come hither  dost thou know if that young harlot is to be with my brother to night she said she knew not what to answer  because she had threatened her if she said yes  but at last my lady said  i will know the bottom of this iniquity  i suppose they won t have so much impudence to be together while i m in the house  but i dare say they have been bed fellows said she  i will lie to night in the room i was born in  so get that bed ready  that room being our bedchamber  mrs  jewkes  after some hesitation  replied  madam  my master lies there  and has the key  i believe  woman  said she  thou tellest me a story  indeed  madam  said she  he does  and has some papers there he will let nobody see  for mrs jewkes said  she feared she would beat her if she went up  and found by my clothes  and some of my master s  how it was so she said  i will then lie in the best room  as it is called  and jackey shall lie in the little green room adjoining to it  has thy master got the keys of those no  madam  said mrs  jewkes  i will order them to be made ready for your ladyship and where dost thou lay the pursy sides  said she  up two pair of stairs  madam  next the garden  and where lies the young harlotry continued she  sometimes with me  madam  said she  and sometimes with thy virtuous master  i suppose  said my lady ha  woman  what sayest thou  i must not speak  said mrs  jewkes  well  thou mayest go  said she  but thou hast the air of a secret keeper of that sort i dare say thoul t set the good work forward most cordially  poor mrs  jewkes  said my master  and laughed most heartily this talk we had whilst we were undressing  so she and her woman lay together in the room my master lay in before i was happy i said  dear sir  pray  in the morning let me lock myself up in the closet  as soon as you rise  and not be called down for ever so much for i am afraid to see her ladyship  and i will employ myself about my journal  while these things are in my head  don t be afraid  my dear said he  am not i with you mrs  jewkes pitied me for what i had undergone in the day  and i said we won t make the worst of it to my dear master  because we won t exasperate where we would reconcile  but  added i  i am much obliged to you  mrs  jewkes  and i thank you  said my master  i hope she did not beat your lady  mrs  jewkes  not much  sir  said she  but i believe i saved my lady once  yet  added she  i was most vexed at the young lord  ay  mrs  jewkes  said my master  let me know his behaviour  i can chastise him  though i cannot my sister  who is a woman  let me therefore know the part he acted nothing  my dear sir  said i  but impertinence  if i may so say  and foolishness  that was very provoking  but i spared him not  and so there is no room  sir  for your anger  no  sir  said mrs  jewkes  nothing else indeed how was her woman  said my master  pretty impertinent  replied mrs jewkes  as ladies  women will be  but  said i  you know she saved me once or twice  very true  madam  returned mrs  jewkes  and she said to me at table  that you were a sweet creature  she never saw your equal but that you had a spirit  and she was sorry you answered her lady so who never bore so much contradiction before  i told her  added mrs jewkes  that if i was in your ladyship s place  i should have taken much more upon me  and that you were all sweetness  and she said  i was got over  she saw tuesday morning  the sixth of my happiness my master had said to mrs  jewkes  that he should not rise till eight or nine  as he had sat up all the night before  but it seems  my lady knowing he usually rose about six  got up soon after that hour  raised her woman and her nephew  having a whimsical scheme in her head  to try to find whether we were in bed together  and  about half an hour after six  she rapped at our chamber door my master was waked at the noise  and asked  who was there  open the door  said she  open it this minute  i said  clinging about his neck dear  dear sir  pray  pray don t o save me  save me  don t fear pamela  said he  the woman s mad  i believe but he called out  who are you  what do you want you know my voice well enough  said she i will come in pray  sir  said i  don t let her ladyship in don t be frightened  my dear  said he  she thinks we are not married  and are afraid to be found a bed together  i ll let her in  but she shan t come near my dearest so he slipt out of bed  and putting on some of his clothes  and gown and slippers  he said  what bold body dare disturb my repose thus  and opened the door  in rushed she  i ll see your wickedness  said she  i will  in vain shall you think to hide it from me what should i hide said he  how dare you set a foot into my house  after the usage i have received from you i had covered myself over head and ears  and trembled every joint  he looked  and spied her woman and kinsman in the room  she crying out  bear witness  jackey  bear witness  beck  the creature is now in his bed  and not seeing the young gentleman before who was at the feet of the bed  he said  how now  sir  what s your business in this apartment  begone this moment and he went away directly beck  said my lady  you see the creature is in his bed  i do  madam answered she  my master came to me  and said  ay  look  beck  and bear witness  here is my pamela my dear angel  my lovely creature  don t be afraid  look up  and see how frantickly this woman of quality behaves at that  i just peeped  and saw my lady  who could not bear this  coming to me  and she said  wicked abandoned wretch  vile brother  to brave me thus  i ll tear the creature out of bed before your face  and expose you both as you deserve at that he took her in his arms  as if she had been nothing  and carrying her out of the room  she cried out  beck  beck  help me  beck the wretch is going to fling me down stairs  her woman ran to him and said  good sir  for heaven s sake do no violence to my lady  her ladyship has been ill all night he sat her down in the chamber she lay in  and she could not speak for passion  take care of your lady  said he  and when she has rendered herself more worthy of my attention  i ll see her  till then  at her peril  and yours too  come not near my apartment  and so he came to me and  with all the sweet soothing words in the world  pacified my fears and gave me leave to go to write in my closet  as soon as my fright was over  and to stay there till things were more calm  and so he dressed himself  and went out of the chamber  permitting me  at my desire  to fasten the door after him at breakfast time my master tapped at the door  and i said  who s there  i  my dearest  said he  oh  then  replied i  i will open it with pleasure  i had written on a good deal  but i put it by  when i ran to the door  i would have locked it again  when he was in  but he said  am not i here  don t be afraid  said he  will you come down to breakfast my love  o no  dear sir  said i  be pleased to excuse me  said he i cannot bear the look of it  that the mistress of my house should breakfast in her closet  as if she durst not come down  and i at home o  dearest sir  replied i  pray pass that over  for my sake  and don t let my presence aggravate your sister  for a kind punctilio  then my dear  said he  i will breakfast with you here  no  pray  dear sir answered i  breakfast with your sister  that  my dear  replied he  will too much gratify her pride  and look like a slight to you dear sir said i  your goodness is too great  for me to want punctilious proofs of it  pray oblige her ladyship  she is your guest surely  sir  you may be freest with your dutiful wife she is a strange woman  said he  how i pity her she has thrown herself into a violent fit of the colic  through passion  and is but now  her woman says  a little easier  i hope  sir  said i  when you carried her ladyship out  you did not hurt her  no  replied he  i love her too well i set her down in the apartment she had chosen  and she but now desires to see me  and that i will breakfast with her  or refuses to touch any thing  but  if my dearest please  i will insist it shall be with you at the same time o  no  no  dear sir  said i  i should not forgive myself  if i did  i would on my knees beg her ladyship s goodness to me  now i am in your presence  though i thought i ought to carry it a little stiff when you were absent  for the sake of the honour you have done me  and  dear sir if my deepest humility will please  permit me to shew it you shall do nothing  returned he  unworthy of my wife  to please the proud woman but i will  however  permit you to breakfast by yourself this once  as i have not seen her since i have used her in so barbarous a manner  as i understand she exclaims i have  and as she will not eat any thing  unless i give her my company so he saluted me  and withdrew  and i locked the door after him again for fear mrs  jewkes soon after rapped at the door  who s there  said i  only i  madam  so i opened the door  tis a sad thing  madam  said she you should be so much afraid in your own house  she brought me some chocolate and toast  and i asked her about my lady s behaviour  she said  she would not suffer any body to attend but her woman  because she would not be heard what she had to say  but she believed  she said  her master was very angry with the young lord  as she called her kinsman for  as she passed by the door  she heard him say  in a high tone  i hope  sir  you did not forget what belongs to the character you assume or to that effect about one o clock my master came up again  and he said  will you come down to dinner  pamela  when i send for you  whatever you command  sir i must do  but my lady won t desire to see me  no matter whether she will or no  but i will not suffer  that she shall prescribe her insolent will to my wife  and in your own house too i will  by my tenderness to you  mortify her pride  and it cannot be done so well as to her face dearest sir  said i  pray indulge me  and let me dine here by myself  it will make my lady but more inveterate said he  i have told her we are married  she is out of all patience about it  and yet pretends not to believe it  upon that i tell her  then she shall have it her own way and that i am not  and what has she to do with it either way  she has scolded and begged  commanded and prayed  blessed me  and cursed me by turns  twenty times in these few hours  and i have sometimes soothed her  sometimes raged  and at last left her  and took a turn in the garden for an hour to compose myself  because you should not see how the foolish woman has ruffled me  and just now i came out  seeing her coming in just as he had said so  i cried  oh  my lady  my lady  for i heard her voice in the chamber  saying  brother  brother  one word with you stopping in sight of the closet where i was  he stepped out  and she went up to the window that looks towards the garden  and said  mean fool that i am  to follow you up and down the house in this manner though i am shunned and avoided by you  you a brother you a barbarian is it possible we could be born of one mother why  said he  do you charge me with a conduct to you  that you bring upon yourself is it not surprising that you should take the liberty with me  that the dear mother you have named never gave you an example for to any of her relations was it not sufficient  that i was insolently taken to task by you in your letters  but my retirements must be invaded  my house insulted  and  if i have one person dearer to me than another  that that person must be singled out for an object of your violence ay  said she  that one person is the thing but though i came with a resolution to be temperate  and to expostulate with you on your avoiding me so unkindly  yet cannot i have patience to look upon that bed in which i was born  and to be made the guilty scene of your wickedness with such a hush  said he  i charge you  call not the dear girl by any name unworthy of her  you know not  as i told you  her excellence  and i desire you ll not repeat the freedoms you have taken below she stamped with her foot  and said  god give me patience  so much contempt to a sister that loves you so well  and so much tenderness to a vile he put his hand before her mouth  be silent  said he  once more  i charge you  you know not the innocence you abuse so freely  i ought not neither will i bear it she sat down and fanned herself  and burst into tears  and such sobs of grief  or rather passion  that grieved me to hear  and i sat and trembled sadly he walked about the room in great anger  and at last said  let me ask you  lady davers  why i am thus insolently to be called to account by you  am i not independent  am i not of age  am i not at liberty to please myself would to god  that  instead of a woman  and my sister any man breathing had dared  whatever were his relation under that of a father  to give himself half the airs you have done why did you not send on this accursed errand your lord  who could write me such a letter as no gentleman should write  nor any gentleman tamely receive  he should have seen the difference we all know  said she  that  since your italian duel  you have commenced a bravo  and all your airs breathe as strongly of the manslayer as of the libertine  this  said he  i will bear  for i have no reason to be ashamed of that duel  nor the cause of it  since it was to save a friend  and because it is levelled at myself only  but suffer not your tongue to take too great a liberty with my pamela she interrupted him in a violent burst of passion  if i bear this  said she  i can bear any thing o the little strumpet he interrupted her then  and said wrathfully  begone  rageful woman  begone this moment from my presence  leave my house this instant i renounce you  and all relation to you  and never more let me see your face  or call me brother  and took her by the hand to lead her out  she laid hold of the curtains of the window  and said  i will not go  you shall not force me from you thus ignominiously in the wretch s hearing  and suffer her to triumph over me in your barbarous treatment of me not considering any thing  i ran out of the closet  and threw myself at my dear master s feet  as he held her hand  in order to lead her out and i said  dearest sir  let me beg  that no act of unkindness  for my sake  pass between so worthy and so near relations  dear  dear madam said i  and clasped her knees  pardon and excuse the unhappy cause of all this evil  on my knees i beg your ladyship to receive me to your grace and favour  and you shall find me incapable of any triumph but in your ladyship s goodness to me creature  said she  art thou to beg an excuse for me art thou to implore my forgiveness  is it to thee i am to owe the favour  that i am not cast headlong from my brother s presence  begone to thy corner wench  begone  i say  lest thy paramour kill me for trampling thee under my foot rise  my dear pamela  said my master  rise  dear life of my life  and expose not so much worthiness to the ungrateful scorn of so violent a spirit  and so he led me to my closet again  and there i sat and wept her woman came up  just as he had led me to my closet  and was returning to her lady  and she very humbly said  excuse my intrusion  good sir i hope i may come to my lady  yes  mrs  worden  said he  you may come in and pray take your lady down stairs with you  for fear i should too much forget what belongs either to my sister or myself i began to think seeing her ladyship so outrageous with her brother what a happy escape i had had the day before  though hardly enough used in conscience too  as i thought her woman begged her ladyship to walk down  and she said  beck  seest thou that bed  that was the bed that i was born in  and yet that was the bed thou sawest  as well as i  the wicked pamela in  this morning  and this brother of mine just risen from her true  said he  you both saw it  and it is my pride that you could see it  tis my bridal bed  and tis abominable that the happiness i knew before you came hither  should be so barbarously interrupted swear to me but  thou bold wretch  said she  swear to me  that pamela andrews is really and truly thy lawful wife  without sham  without deceit  without double meaning  and i know what i have to say i ll humour you for once  said he  and then swore a solemn oath that i was  and  said he  did i not tell you so at first i cannot yet believe you  said she  because  in this particular  i had rather have called you knave than fool provoke me not too much  said he  for  if i should as much forget myself as you have done  you d have no more of a brother in me  than i have a sister in you who married you  said she  tell me that  was it not a broken attorney in a parson s habit  tell me truly  in the wench s hearing  when she s undeceived  she ll know how to behave herself better  thank god  thought i  it is not so no  said he  and i ll tell you  that i bless god  i abhorred that project  before it was brought to bear  and mr  williams married us nay then  said she but answer me another question or two  i beseech you  who gave her away  parson peters  said he  where was the ceremony performed  in my little chapel  which you may see  as it was put in order on purpose now  said she  i begin to fear there is something in it  but who was present  said she  methinks  replied he  i look like a fine puppy  to suffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent sister  but  if you must know  mrs  jewkes was present  o the procuress  said she  but nobody else  yes  said he  all my heart and soul wretch  said she  and what would thy father and mother have said had they lived to this day  their consents  replied he  i should have thought it my duty to ask  but not yours  madam suppose  said she  i had married my father s groom  what would you have said to that i could not have behaved worse  replied he  than you have done  and would you not have thought  said she  i had deserved it said he  does your pride let you see no difference in the case you put none at all  said she  where can the difference be between a beggar s son married by a lady  or a beggar s daughter made a gentleman s wife then i ll tell you  replied he  the difference is  a man ennobles the woman he takes  be she who she will  and adopts her into his own rank be it what it will  but a woman  though ever so nobly born  debases herself by a mean marriage  and descends from her own rank to his she stoops to when the royal family of stuart allied itself into the low family of hyde  comparatively low  i mean  did any body scruple to call the lady  royal highness  and duchess of york  and did any body think her daughters  the late queen mary and queen anne  less royal for that when the broken fortuned peer goes into the city to marry a rich tradesman s daughter  be he duke or earl  does not his consort immediately become ennobled by his choice  and who scruples to call her lady  duchess  or countess but when a duchess or countess dowager descends to mingle with a person of obscure birth  does she not then degrade herself  and is she not effectually degraded  and will any duchess or countess rank with her now  lady davers  do you not see a difference between my marrying my dear mother s beloved and deserving waiting maid  with a million of excellencies about her  and such graces of mind and person as would adorn any distinction  and your marrying a sordid groom  whose constant train of education  conversation  and opportunities  could possibly give him no other merit  than that which must proceed from the vilest  lowest taste  in his sordid dignifier o the wretch  said she  how he finds excuses to palliate his meanness again  said he  let me observe to you  lady davers  when a duke marries a private person  is he not still her head  by virtue of being her husband  but  when a lady descends to marry a groom  is not the groom her head  being her husband  and does not the difference strike you  for what lady of quality ought to respect another  who has made so sordid a choice  and set a groom above her  for  would not that be to put that groom upon a par with themselves call this palliation  or what you will  but if you see not the difference  you are blind  and a very unfit judge for yourself  much more unfit to be a censurer of me i d have you  said she  publish your fine reasons to the world  and they will be sweet encouragements to all the young gentlemen who read them to cast themselves away on the servant wenches in their families not at all  lady davers  replied he  for  if any young gentleman stays till he finds such a person as my pamela  so enriched with the beauties of person and mind  so well accomplished  and so fitted to adorn the degree she is raised to  he will stand as easily acquitted  as i shall be to all the world that sees her  except there be many more lady davers than i apprehend can possibly be met with and so  returned she  you say you are actually and really married honestly  or rather foolishly married  to this slut i am  indeed  says he  if you presume to call her so  and why should i not  if i please  who is there ought to contradict me  whom have i hurt by it have i not an estate  free and independent am i likely to be beholden to you  or any of my relations  and why  when i have a sufficiency in my own single hands  should i scruple to make a woman equally happy  who has all i want  for beauty  virtue  prudence  and generosity too  i will tell you  she has more than any lady i ever saw yes  lady davers  she has all these naturally  they are born with her and a few years  education  with her genius  has done more for her  than a whole life has done for others no more  no more  i beseech you  said she  thou surfeitest me  honest man  with thy weak folly  thou art worse than an idolater  thou hast made a graven image  and thou fallest down and worshippest the works of thy own hands  and  jeroboam like  wouldst have every body else bow down before thy calf well said  lady davers  whenever your passion suffers you to descend to witticism  tis almost over with you  but let me tell you  though i myself worship this sweet creature  that you call such names  i want nobody else to do it  and should be glad you had not intruded upon me to interrupt me in the course of our mutual happiness well said  well said  my kind  my well mannered brother  said she  i shall  after this  very little interrupt your mutual happiness  i ll assure you  i thought you a gentleman once  and prided myself in my brother  but i ll say now with the burial service  ashes to ashes  and dirt to dirt ay  said he  lady davers  and there we must all end at last  you with all your pride  and i with my plentiful fortune  must come to it  and then where will be your distinction  let me tell you  except you and i both mend our manners  though you have been no duellist  no libertine as you call me  this amiable girl  whom your vanity and folly so much despise  will out soar us both  infinitely out soar us  and he who judges best  will give the preference where due  without regard to birth or fortune egregious preacher  said she  what  my brother already turned puritan see what marriage and repentance may bring a man to  i heartily congratulate this change well  said she  and came towards me  and i trembled to see her coming  but her brother followed to observe her  and i stood up at her approach  and she said  give me thy hand  mrs  pamela  mrs  andrews  mrs  what shall i call thee thou hast done wonders in a little time  thou hast not only made a rake a husband but thou hast made a rake a preacher  but take care  added she  after all  in ironical anger  and tapped me on the neck  take care that thy vanity begins not where his ends  and that thou callest not thyself my sister she shall  i hope  lady davers  said he  when she can make as great a convert of you from pride  as she has of me  from libertinism mrs  jewkes just then came up  and said dinner was ready  come  my pamela  said my dear master  you desired to be excused from breakfasting with us  but i hope you ll give lady davers and me your company to dinner how dare you insult me thus  said my lady how dare you  said he insult me by your conduct in my own house  after i have told you i am married  how dare you think of staying here one moment  and refuse my wife the honours that belong to her as such merciful god  said she  give me patience  and held her hand to her forehead pray  sir  dear sir  said i  excuse me  don t vex my lady be silent my dear love  said he  you see already what you have got by your sweet condescension  you have thrown yourself at her feet  and  insolent as she is  she has threatened to trample upon you  she ll ask you presently  if she is to owe her excuse to your interposition  and yet nothing else can make her forgiven poor lady  she could not bear this  and  as if she was discomposed  she ran to her poor grieved woman  and took hold of her hand  and said lead me down  lead me down  beck  let us instantly quit this house  this cursed house  that once i took pleasure in  order the fellows to get ready  and i will never see it  nor its owner  more  and away she went down stairs  in a great hurry  and the servants were ordered to make ready for their departure i saw my master was troubled  and i went to him  and said  pray  dear sir  follow my lady down  and pacify her  tis her love to you poor woman  said he  i am concerned for her  but i insist upon your coming down  since things are gone so far  her pride will get new strength else  and we shall be all to begin again dearest  dear sir  said i  excuse my going down this once  indeed  my dear  i won t  replied he  what  shall it be said  that my sister shall scare my wife from my table  and i present no  i have borne too much already  and so have you  and i charge you come down when i send for you he departed  saying these words  and i durst not dispute  for i saw he was determined  and there is as much majesty as goodness in him  as i have often had reason to observe  though never more than on the present occasion with his sister  her ladyship instantly put on her hood and gloves  and her woman tied up a handkerchief full of things  for her principal matters were not unpacked  and her coachman got her chariot ready  and her footmen their horses  and she appeared resolved to go but her kinsman and mr  colbrand had taken a turn together  somewhere and she would not come in  but sat fretting on a seat in the fore yard with her woman by her  and  at last  said to one of the footmen  do you james  stay to attend my nephew  and we ll take the road we came mrs  jewkes went to her ladyship  and said  your ladyship will be pleased to stay dinner  tis just coming upon table  no  said she  i have enough of this house  i have indeed  but give my service to your master  and i wish him happier than he has made me he had sent for me down  and i came  though unwillingly  and the cloth was laid in the parlour i had jumped out of  and there was my master walking about it  mrs  jewkes came in  and asked  if he pleased to have dinner brought in  for my lady would not come in  but desired her service  and wished him happier than he had made her  he  seeing her at the window  when he went to that side of the room  all ready to go stept out to her  and said  lady davers  if i thought you would not be hardened  rather than softened  by my civility  i would ask you to walk in  and  at least  let your kinsman and servants dine before they go she wept  and turned her face from him  to hide it  he took her hand and said  come  sister  let me prevail upon you  walk in  no  said she don t ask me i wish i could hate you  as much as you hate me you do said he  and a great deal more  i ll assure you  or else you d not vex me as you do come  pray walk in  don t ask me  said she  her kinsman just then returned  why  madam  said he  your ladyship won t go till you have dined  i hope  no  jackey  said she  i can t stay  i m an intruder here  it seems think  said my master  of the occasion you gave for that word  your violent passions are the only intruders  lay them aside and never sister was dearer to a brother  don t say such another word said she  i beseech you  for i am too easy to forgive you any thing for one kind word you shall have one hundred  said he  nay  ten thousand if they will do  my dear sister  and  kissing her  he added  pray give me your hand  john  said he  put up the horses  you are all as welcome to me  for all your lady s angry with me  as at any inn you can put up at  come  mr  h  said he  lead your aunt in  for she won t permit that honour to me this quite overcame her  and she said  giving her brother her hand yes  i will  and you shall lead me any where  and kissed him  but don t think  said she  i can forgive you neither  and so he led her into the parlour where i was  but  said she  why do you lead me to this wench tis my wife  my dear sister  and if you will not love her  yet don t forget common civilities to her  for your own sake pray  madam  said her kinsman  since your brother is pleased to own his marriage  we must not forget common civilities  as mr  b  says  and sir  added he  permit me to wish you joy  thank you  sir  said he and may i  said he  looking at me  yes  sir  replied my master  so he saluted me  very complaisantly  and said  i vow to gad  madam  i did not know this yesterday  and if i was guilty of a fault  i beg your pardon my lady said  thou rt a good natured foolish fellow  thou might st have saved this nonsensical parade  till i had given thee leave  why  aunt said he  if they are actually married  there s no help for it  and we must not make mischief between man and wife but brother  said she  do you think i ll sit at table with the creature no contemptuous names  i beseech you  lady davers  i tell you she is really my wife  and i must be a villain to suffer her to be ill used she has no protector but me  and  if you will permit her  she will always love and honour you indeed  indeed i will  madam  said i i cannot  i won t sit down at table with her  said she  pamela  i hope thou dost not think i will indeed  madam  said i  if your good brother will permit it  i will attend your chair all the time you dine  to shew my veneration for your ladyship  as the sister of my kind protector see  said he  her condition has not altered her  but i cannot permit in her a conduct unworthy of my wife  and i hope my sister will not expect it neither let her leave the room  replied she  if i must stay  indeed you are out of the way  aunt  said her kinsman  that is not right  as things stand said my master  no  madam  that must not be  but  if it must be so we ll have two tables  you and your nephew shall sit at one  and my wife and i at the other  and then see what a figure your unreasonable punctilio will make you cut she seemed irresolute  and he placed her at the table  the first course  which was fish  being brought in  where said she to me  would st thou presume to sit  would st have me give place to thee too  wench come  come  said my master  i ll put that out of dispute  and so set himself down by her ladyship  at the upper end of the table  and placed me at his left hand  excuse me  my dear  said he this once excuse me oh  your cursed complaisance  said she  to such a  hush  sister  hush  said he  i will not bear to hear her spoken slightly of  tis enough  that  to oblige your violent and indecent caprice  you make me compromise with you thus come  sir  added he  pray take your place next your gentle aunt beck said she  do you sit down by pamela there  since it must be so  we ll be hail fellow all  with all my heart  replied my master  i have so much honour for all the sex  that i would not have the meanest person of it stand  while i sit  had i been to have made the custom  mrs  worden pray sit down  sir  said she  i hope i shall know my place better my lady sat considering  and then  lifting up her hands  said  lord what will this world come to to nothing but what s very good  replied my master  if such spirits as lady davers s do but take the rule of it shall i help you  sister  to some of the carp  help your beloved  said she  that s kind  said he now  that s my good lady davers  here my love  let me help you  since my sister desires it mighty well returned she  mighty well but sat on one side  turning from me  as it were dear aunt  said her kinsman  let s see you buss and be friends  since tis so  what signifies it  hold thy fool s tongue  said she  is thy tone so soon turned since yesterday  said my master  i hope nothing affronting was offered yesterday to my wife  in her own house  she hit him a good smart slap on the shoulder  take that  impudent brother said she  i ll wife you  and in her own house  she seemed half afraid  but he  in very good humour  kissed her  and said  i thank you  sister  i thank you  but i have not had a blow from you before for some time fore gad  said her kinsman  tis very kind of you to take it so well her ladyship is as good a woman as ever lived  but i ve had many a cuff from her myself i won t put it up neither  said my master  except you ll assure me you have seen her serve her lord so i pressed my foot to his  and said  softly  don t  dear sir what  said she  is the creature begging me off from insult  if his manners won t keep him from outraging me  i won t owe his forebearance to thee  wench said my master  and put some fish on my lady s plate  well does lady davers use the word insult but  come  let me see you eat one mouthful and i ll forgive you  and he put the knife in one of her hands  and the fork in the other  as i hope to live  said he  i cannot bear this silly childishness  for nothing at all  i am quite ashamed of it she put a little bit to her mouth  but laid it down in her plate again i cannot eat  said she  i cannot swallow  i m sure  it will certainly choak me  he had forbid his menservants to come in  that they might not behold the scene he expected  and rose from table himself  and filled a glass of wine  her woman offering  and her kinsman rising  to do it mean time  his seat between us being vacant  she turned to me  how now confidence  said she  darest thou sit next me  why dost thou not rise and take the glass from thy property sit still  my dear  said he  i ll help you both  but i arose  for i was afraid of a good cuff  and said  pray  sir  let me help my lady  so you shall  replied he  when she s in a humour to receive it as she ought sister  said he  with a glass in his hand  pray drink  you ll perhaps eat a little bit of something then  is this to insult me  said she no really  returned he  but to incite you to eat  for you ll be sick for want of it she took the glass  and said  god forgive you  wicked wretch  for your usage of me this day this is a little as it used to be i once had your love and now it is changed  and for whom  that vexes me  and wept so  she was forced to set down the glass you don t do well  said he  you neither treat me like your brother nor a gentleman  and if you would suffer me  i would love you as well as ever but for a woman of sense and understanding  and a fine bred woman  as i once thought my sister  you act quite a childish part  come added he  and held the glass to her lips  let your brother  that you once loved  prevail on you to drink this glass of wine she then drank it  he kissed her  and said  oh  how passion deforms the noblest minds you have lost a good deal of that loveliness that used to adorn my sister  and let me persuade you to compose yourself  and be my sister again for lady davers is  indeed  a fine woman  and has a presence as majestic for a lady  as her dear brother has for a gentleman he then sat down between us again  and said  when the second course came in  let abraham come in and wait  i touched his toe again  but he minded it not  and i saw he was right  for her ladyship began to recollect herself  and did not behave half so ill before the servants  as she had done  and helped herself with some little freedom  but she could not forbear a strong sigh and a sob now and then  she called for a glass of the same wine she had drank before  said he  shall i help you again lady davers and rose  at the same time  and went to the sideboard and filled her a glass  indeed  said she  i love to be soothed by my brother your health  sir said my master to me  with great sweetness  my dear  now i m up  i ll fill for you i must serve both sisters alike  she looked at the servant  as if he were a little check upon her  and said to my master how now  sir not that you know of  he whispered her  don t shew any contempt before my servants to one i have so deservedly made their mistress  consider  tis done ay  said she  that s the thing that kills me he gave me a glass  my good lady s health  sir  said i that won t do said she  leaning towards me  softly  and was going to say wench  or creature  or some such word  and my master  seeing abraham look towards her  her eyes being red and swelled  said  indeed  sister  i would not vex myself about it  if i was you  about what  said she  why  replied he  about your lord s not coming down  as he had promised  he sat down and she tapped him on the shoulder  ah  wicked one  said she  nor will that do neither why  to be sure  added he  it would vex a lady of your sense and merit to be slighted  if it was so  but i am sure my lord loves you  as well as you love him  and you know not what may have happened she shook her head  and said  that s like your art this makes one amazed you should be so caught who  my lord caught  said he  no  no he ll have more wit than so  but i never heard you were jealous before nor  said he  have you any reason to think so now honest friend  you need not wait  said she  my woman will help us to what we want  yes  let him  replied he  abraham  fill me a glass  come  said my master lord davers to you  madam  i hope he ll take care he is not found out you re very provoking  brother  said she  i wish you were as good as lord davers but don t carry your jest too far  well  said he  tis a tender point  i own  i ve done by these kind managements the dinner passed over better than i expected and when the servants were withdrawn  my master said  still keeping his place between us  i have a question to ask you  lady davers  and that is  if you ll bear me company to bedfordshire  i was intending to set out thither to morrow  but i ll tarry your pleasure  if you ll go with me is thy wife  as thou callest her  to go along with thee  friend  said she  yes  to be sure  answered he  my dear quaker sister  and took her hand  and smiled  and would st have me parade it with her on the road hey and make one to grace her retinue hey  tell me how thoud st chalk it out  if i would do as thou would st have me  honest friend he clasped his arms about her  and kissed her  you are a dear saucy sister  said he  but i must love you why  i ll tell you how i d have it  here shall you  and my pamela leave out my  i desire you  if you d have me sit patiently  no  replied he  i can t do that  here shall you and my pamela  go together in your chariot  if you please  and she will then appear as one of your retinue  and your nephew and i will sometimes ride  and sometimes go into my chariot  to your woman should st thou like this  creature  said she to me if your ladyship think it not too great an honour for me  madam  said i  yes  replied she  but my ladyship does think it would be too great an honour now i think of it  said he  this must not be neither  for  without you d give her the hand in your own chariot  my wife would be thought your woman  and that must not be  why  that would  may be  said she  be the only inducement for me to bear her near me  in my chariot but  how then why then  when we came home  we d get lord davers to come to us and stay a month or two and what if he was to come why i would have you  as i know you have a good fancy  give pamela your judgment on some patterns i expect from london  for clothes provoking wretch  said she  now i wish i may keep my hands to myself  i don t say it to provoke you  said he  nor ought it to do so  but when i tell you i am married  is it not a consequence that we must have new clothes hast thou any more of these obliging things to say to me  friend  said she  i will make you a present  returned he  worth your acceptance if you will grace us with your company at church  when we make our appearance take that  said she  if i die for it  wretch that thou art and was going to hit him a great slap  but he held her hand  her kinsman said  dear aunt  i wonder at you  why  all these are things of course i begged leave to withdraw  and  as i went out  my good master said there s a person  there s a shape  there s a sweetness  o  lady davers were you a man  you would doat on her  as i do  yes  said the naughty lady  so i should  for my harlot  but not for my wife  i turned  on this  and said  indeed your ladyship is cruel  and well may gentlemen take liberties  when ladies of honour say such things  and i wept  and added  your ladyship s inference  if your good brother was not the most generous of men  would make me very unhappy no fear  wench  no fear  said she  thou lt hold him as long as any body can  i see that poor sally godfrey never had half the interest in him i ll assure you stay  my pamela  said he  in a passion  stay  when i bid you  you have now heard two vile charges upon me i love you with such a true affection  that i ought to say something before this malicious accuser that you may not think your consummate virtue linked to so black a villain her nephew seemed uneasy  and blamed her much  and i came back  but trembled as i stood  and he set me down  and said  taking my hand  i have been accused  my dear  as a dueller  and now as a profligate  in another sense  and there was a time i should not have received these imputations with so much concern as i now do  when i would wish  by degrees  by a conformity of my manners to your virtue  to shew every one the force your example has upon me  but this briefly is the case of the first i had a friend  who had been basely attempted to be assassinated by bravoes  hired by a man of title in italy  who  like many other persons of title  had no honour  and  at padua  i had the fortune to disarm one of these bravoes in my friend s defence  and made him confess his employer  and him  i own  i challenged  at sienna we met  and he died in a month after  of a fever  but  i hope  not occasioned by the slight wounds he had received from me  though i was obliged to leave italy upon it  sooner than i intended  because of his numerous relations  who looked upon me as the cause of his death  though i pacified them by a letter i wrote them from inspruck  acquainting them with the baseness of the deceased  and they followed me not to munich  as they intended this is one of the good natured hints that might shock your sweetness on reflecting that you are yoked with a murderer  the other nay brother  said she  say no more  tis your own fault if you go further she shall know it all  said he  and i defy the utmost stretch of your malice when i was at college  i was well received by a widow lady  who had several daughters  and but small fortunes to give them  and the old lady set one of them a deserving good girl she was  to draw me into marriage with her  for the sake of the fortune i was heir to  and contrived many opportunities to bring us and leave us together  i was not then of age  and the young lady  not half so artful as her mother yielded to my addresses before the mother s plot could be ripened  and so utterly disappointed it  this  my pamela  is the sally godfrey  this malicious woman  with the worst intentions  has informed you of  and whatever other liberties i may have taken  for perhaps some more i have  which  had she known  you had heard of  as well as this  i desire heaven will only forgive me  till i revive its vengeance by the like offences  in injury to my pamela and now  my dear  you may withdraw  for this worthy sister of mine has said all the bad she knows of me  and what  at a proper opportunity when i could have convinced you  that they were not my boast  but my concern  i should have acquainted you with myself  for i am not fond of being thought better than i am  though i hope  from the hour i devoted myself to so much virtue  to that of my death  my conduct shall be irreproachable she was greatly moved at this  and the noble manner in which the dear gentleman owned and repented of his faults  and gushed out into tears and said  no  don t yet go  pamela  i beseech you  my passion has carried me too far  a great deal  and  coming to me  she shook my hand and said  you must stay to hear me beg his pardon  and so took his hand but  to my concern  for i was grieved for her ladyship s grief he burst from her  and went out of the parlour into the garden in a violent rage  that made me tremble  her ladyship sat down  and leaned her head against my bosom  and made my neck wet with her tears  holding me by the hands  and i wept for company her kinsman walked up and down the parlour in a sad fret  and going out afterwards  he came in  and said  mr  b  has ordered his chariot to be got ready  and won t be spoken to by any body  where is he  said she walking in the garden till it is ready  replied he well  said she  i have indeed gone too far  i was bewitched  and now  said she  malicious as he calls me  will he not forgive me for a twelvemonth  for i tell you  pamela  if ever you offend  he will not easily forgive  i was all delighted  though sad  to see her ladyship so good to me  will you venture  said she  to accompany me to him dare you follow a lion in his retreats i ll attend your ladyship  said i wherever you command  well  wench  said she  pamela  i mean  thou art very good in the main i should have loved thee as well as my mother did if but tis all over now  indeed you should not have married my brother  but come  i must love him  let s find him out  and yet will he use me worse than a dog i should not  added she  have so much exasperated him  for  whenever i have  i have always had the worst of it  he knows i love him in this manner her ladyship talked to me  leaning on my arm  and walking into the garden  i saw he was still in a tumult  as it were  and he took another walk to avoid us  she called after him  and said  brother brother  let me speak to you one word with you  and as we made haste towards him  and came near to him  i desire  said he  that you ll not oppress me more with your follies  and your violence  i have borne too much with you  and i will vow for a twelvemonth  from this day hush said she  don t vow  i beg you for too well will you keep it  i know by experience  if you do  you see  said she  i stoop to ask pamela to be my advocate  sure that will pacify you indeed  said he  i desire to see neither of you  on such an occasion and let me only be left to myself  for i will not be intruded upon thus and was going away but  said she  one word first  i desire if you ll forgive me  i ll forgive you what  said the dear man  haughtily  will you forgive me why  said she  for she saw him too angry to mention his marriage  as a subject that required her pardon i will forgive you all your bad usage of me this day i will be serious with you  sister  said he  i wish you most sincerely well  but let us  from this time  study so much one another s quiet as never to come near one another more  never  said she and can you desire this  barbarous brother  can you i can  i do  said he  and i have nothing to do  but to hide from you  not a brother  but a murderer and a profligate  unworthy of your relation  and let me be consigned to penitence for my past evils  a penitence  however  that shall not be broken in upon by so violent an accuser pamela  said he  and made me tremble  how dare you approach me  without leave  when you see me thus disturbed never  for the future  come near me  when i am in these tumults  unless i send for you dear sir  said i leave me  interrupted he  i will set out for bedfordshire this moment  what  sir  said i  without me what have i done  you have too meanly  said he  for my wife  stooped to this furious sister of mine  and  till i can recollect  i am not pleased with you but colbrand shall attend you  and two other of my servants  and mrs jewkes shall wait upon you part of the way  and i hope you ll find me in a better disposition to receive you there  than i am at parting with you here had i not hoped  that this was partly put on to intimidate my lady  i believe i could not have borne it  but it was grievous to me  for i saw he was most sincerely in a passion i was afraid  said she  he would be angry at you  as well as me  for well do i know his unreasonable violence  when he is moved  but one word  sir  said she  pardon pamela  if you won t me  for she has committed no offence  but that of good nature to me  and at my request i will be gone myself  directly as i was about to do  had you not prevented me i prevented you  said he  through love  but you have strung me for it  through hatred  but as for my pamela  i know  besides the present moment  i cannot be angry with her  and therefore i desire her never to see me  on such occasions  till i can see her in the temper i ought to be in  when so much sweetness approaches me  tis therefore i say  my dearest  leave me now but  sir  said i  must i leave you  and let you go to bedfordshire without me  oh  dear sir  how can i said my lady  you may go to morrow  both of you  as you had designed  and i will go away this afternoon  and  since i cannot be forgiven  will try to forget i have a brother may i  sir  said i  beg all your anger on myself  and to be reconciled to your good sister  presuming pamela  replied he  and made me start art thou then so hardy  so well able to sustain a displeasure  which of all things  i expected from thy affection  and thy tenderness  thou would st have wished to avoid now  said he  and took my hand  and  as it were  tossed it from him  begone from my presence  and reflect upon what you have said to me i was so frightened  for then i saw he took amiss what i said  that i took hold of his knees  as he was turning from me  and i said  forgive me  good sir  you see i am not so hardy  i cannot bear your displeasure and was ready to sink his sister said  only forgive pamela  tis all i ask you ll break her spirit quite you ll carry your passion as much too far as i have done i need not say  said he  how well i love her  but she must not intrude upon me at such times as these i had intended  as soon as i could have quelled  by my reason  the tumults you had caused by your violence  to have come in  and taken such a leave of you both  as might become a husband  and a brother  but she has  unbidden  broke in upon me  and must take the consequence of a passion  which  when raised  is as uncontrollable as your own said she  did i not love you so well  as sister never loved a brother  i should not have given you all this trouble  and did i not  said he  love you better than you are resolved to deserve  i should be indifferent to all you say  but this last instance  after the duelling story which you would not have mentioned  had you not known it is always matter of concern for me to think upon  of poor sally godfrey  is a piece of spite and meanness  that i can renounce you my blood for well  said she  i am convinced it was wrong  i am ashamed of it myself twas poor  twas mean  twas unworthy of your sister  and tis for this reason i stoop to follow you  to beg your pardon  and even to procure one for my advocate  who i thought had some interest in you  if i might have believed your own professions to her  which now i shall begin to think made purposely to insult me i care not what you think after the meanness you have been guilty of i can only look upon you with pity  for  indeed  you have fallen very low with me tis plain i have  said she  but i ll begone and so  brother  let me call you for this once  god bless you  and pamela  said her ladyship god bless you  and kissed me  and wept i durst say no more  and my lady turning from him  he said  your sex is the d l  how strangely can you discompose  calm  and turn  as you please  us poor weathercocks of men  your last kind blessing to my pamela i cannot stand  kiss but each other again  and then he took both our hands  and joined them  and my lady saluting me again  with tears on both sides  he put his kind arms about each of our waists  and saluted us with great affection  saying  now  god bless you both  the two dearest creatures i have in the world well  said she  you will quite forget my fault about miss he stopt her before she could speak the name  and said  for ever forget it and pamela  i ll forgive you too  if you don t again make my displeasure so light a thing to you  as you did just now said my lady  she did not make your displeasure a light thing to her but the heavier it was  the higher compliment she made me  that she would bear it all  rather than not see you and me reconciled  no matter for that  said he  it was either an absence of thought  or a slight by implication  at least  that my niceness could not bear from her tenderness  for looked it not presuming  that she could stand my displeasure  or was sure of making her terms when she pleased  which fond as i am of her  i assure her  will not be always  in wilful faults in her power nay  said my lady  i can tell you  pamela  you have a gentleman here in my brother  and you may expect such treatment from him  as that character  and his known good sense and breeding  will always oblige him to shew  but if you offend  the lord have mercy upon you you see how it is by poor me and yet i never knew him to forgive so soon i am sure  said i  i will take care as much as i can  for i have been frightened out of my wits  and had offended  before i knew where i was so happily did this storm blow over  and my lady was quite subdued and pacified when we came out of the garden  his chariot was ready  and he said well  sister  i had most assuredly gone away towards my other house  if things had not taken this happy turn  and  if you please  instead of it  you and i will take an airing  and pray  my dear  said he to me  bid mrs  jewkes order supper by eight o clock  and we shall then join you sir  added he  to her nephew  will you take your horse and escort us  i will  said he  and am glad  at my soul  to see you all so good friends so my dear lord and master handed my lady into his chariot  and her kinsman and his servants rode after them and i went up to my closet to ruminate on these things  and  foolish thing that i am  this poor miss sally godfrey runs into my head how soon the name and quality of a wife gives one privileges  in one s own account yet  methinks  i want to know more about her  for  is it not strange  that i  who lived years in the family  should have heard nothing of this  but i was so constantly with my lady  that i might the less hear of it  for she  i dare say  never knew it  or she would have told me but i dare not ask him about the poor lady yet i wonder what became of her  whether she be living  and whether any thing came of it may be i shall hear full soon enough but i hope not to any bad purpose as to the other unhappy case  i know it was talked of  that in his travels  before i was taken into the family long  he had one or two broils  and  from a youth  he was always remarkable for courage  and is reckoned a great master of his sword  god grant he may never be put to use it  and that he may be always preserved in honour and safety about seven o clock my master sent word  that he would have me not expect him to supper  for that he  and my lady his sister  and nephew were prevailed upon to stay with lady jones  and that lady darnford  and mr  peters s family  had promised to meet them there  i was glad they did not send for me  and the rather  as i hoped those good families being my friends  would confirm my lady a little in my favour  and so i followed my writing closely about eleven o clock they returned  i had but just come down  having tired myself with my pen  and was sitting talking with mrs  jewkes and mrs  worden  whom i would  though unwillingly on their sides  make sit down  which they did over against me  mrs  worden asked my pardon  in a good deal of confusion  for the part she had acted against me  saying that things had been very differently represented to her  and that she little thought i was married  and that she was behaving so rudely to the lady of the house i said  i took nothing amiss  and very freely forgave her  and hoped my new condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every one  but that i must endeavour to act not unworthy of it  for the honour of the gentleman who had so generously raised me to it mrs  jewkes said  that my situation gave me great opportunities of shewing the excellence of my nature  that i could forgive offences against me so readily  as she  for her own part  must always  she said acknowledge  with confusion of face people  said i  mrs  jewkes  don t know how they shall act  when their wills are in the power of their superiors  and i always thought one should distinguish between acts of malice  and of implicit obedience though  at the same time  a person should know how to judge between lawful and unlawful  and even the great  though at present angry they are not obeyed  will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for withstanding them in their unlawful commands mrs  jewkes seemed a little concerned at this  and i said  i spoke chiefly from my own experience  for that i might say  as they both knew my story  that i had not wanted both for menaces and temptations  and had i complied with the one  or been intimidated by the other  i should not have been what i was ah  madam  replied mrs  jewkes  i never knew any body like you  and i think your temper sweeter  since the happy day  than before  and that if possible  you take less upon you why  a good reason  said i  may be assigned for that  i thought myself in danger  i looked upon every one as my enemy  and it was impossible that i should not be fretful  uneasy  jealous  but when my dearest friend had taken from me the ground of my uneasiness  and made me quite happy  i should have been very blamable  if i had not shewn a satisfied and easy mind  and a temper that should engage every one s respect and love at the same time  if possible  and so much the more  as it was but justifying  in some sort  the honour i had received  for the fewer enemies i made myself  the more i engaged every one to think  that my good benefactor had been less to blame in descending as he has done this way of talking pleased them both very much  and they made me many compliments upon it  and wished me always to be happy  as  they said  i so well deserved we were thus engaged  when my master  and his sister and her nephew came in  and they made me quite alive  in the happy humour in which they all returned  the two women would have withdrawn  but my master said don t go  mrs  worden  mrs  jewkes  pray stay  i shall speak to you presently  so he came to me  and  saluting me  said  well  my dear love i hope i have not trespassed upon your patience  by an absence longer than we designed  but it has not been to your disadvantage  for though we had not your company  we have talked of nobody else but you my lady came up to me  and said  ay  child  you have been all our subject  i don t know how it is  but you have made two or three good families  in this neighbourhood  as much your admirers  as your friend here my sister  said he  has been hearing your praises  pamela  from half a score mouths  with more pleasure than her heart will easily let her express my good lady davers s favour  said i  and the continuance of yours sir  would give me more pride than that of all the rest of the world put together well  child  said she  proud hearts don t come down all at once  though my brother  here  has this day set mine a good many pegs lower than i ever knew it  but i will say  i wish you joy with my brother  and so kissed me my dear lady  said i  you for ever oblige me i shall now believe myself quite happy  this was all i wanted to make me so and i hope i shall always  through my life  shew your ladyship  that i have the most grateful and respectful sense of your goodness but  child  said she  i shall not give you my company when you make your appearance  let your own merit make all your bedfordshire neighbours your friends  as it has done here  by your lincolnshire ones  and you ll have no need of my countenance  nor any body s else now  said her nephew  tis my turn  i wish you joy with all my soul madam  and  by what i have seen  and by what i have heard  fore gad  i think you have met with no more than you deserve  and so all the company says  where we have been  and pray forgive all my nonsense to you sir  said i  i shall always  i hope  respect as i ought  so near a relation of my good lord and lady davers  and i thank you for your kind compliment gad  beck  said he  i believe you ve some forgiveness too to ask  for we were all to blame  to make madam  here  fly the pit  as she did  little did we think we made her quit her own house thou always  said my lady  sayest too much  or too little mrs  worden said  i have been treated with so much goodness and condescension since you went  that i have been beforehand  sir  in asking pardon myself so my lady sat down with me half an hour  and told me  that her brother had carried her a fine airing  and had quite charmed her with his kind treatment of her  and had much confirmed her in the good opinion she had begun to entertain of my discreet and obliging behaviour  but  continued she  when he would make me visit  without intending to stay  my old neighbours  for  said she  lady jones being nearest  we visited her first  and she scraped all the rest of the company together  they were all so full of your praises  that i was quite borne down  and  truly  it was saul among the prophets you may believe how much i was delighted with this  and i spared not my due acknowledgments when her ladyship took leave  to go to bed  she said  goodnight to you heartily  and to your good man  i kissed you when i came in  out of form  but i now kiss you out of more than form  i ll assure you join with me  my dear parents  in my joy for this happy turn  the contrary of which i so much dreaded  and was the only difficulty i had to labour with  this poor miss sally godfrey  i wonder what s become of her  poor soul  i wish he would  of his own head  mention her again not that i am very uneasy  neither you ll say  i must be a little saucy  if i was my dear master gave me an account  when we went up  of the pains he had taken with his beloved sister  as he himself styled her  and of all the kind things the good families had said in my behalf  and that he observed she was not so much displeased with hearing them  as she was at first  when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his wife and that my health  as his spouse  being put  when it came to her  she drank it  but said  come  brother  here s your pamela to you  but i shall not know how to stand this affair  when the countess  and the young ladies  come to visit me  one of these young ladies was the person she was so fond of promoting a match for  with her brother lady betty i know  she said  will rally me smartly upon it  and you know  brother she wants neither wit nor satire  he said  i hope  lady betty  whenever she marries  will meet with a better husband than i should have made her  for  in my conscience  i think i should hardly have made a tolerable one to any but pamela he told me that they rallied him on the stateliness of his temper  and said  they saw he would make an exceeding good husband where he was but it must be owing to my meekness  more than to his complaisance  for said miss darnford  i could see well enough  when your ladyship detained her  though he had but hinted his desire of finding her at our house he was so out of humour at her supposed noncompliance  that mine and my sister s pity for her was much more engaged  than our envy ay  said my lady  he is too lordly a creature  by much  and can t bear disappointment  nor ever could said he  well  lady davers  you should not  of all persons  find fault with me  for i bore a great deal from you  before i was at all angry yes  replied she  but when i had gone a little too far  as i own i did you made me pay for it severely enough  you know you did  sauce box  and the poor thing too  added she  that i took with me for my advocate  so low had he brought me  he treated her in such a manner as made my heart ache for her  but part was art  i know  to make me think the better of her indeed  sister  said he  there was very little of that  for  at that time  i cared not what you thought  nor had complaisance enough to have given a shilling for your good or bad opinion of her or me  and  i own  i was displeased to be broken in upon  after your provocations by either of you and she must learn that lesson  never to come near me when i am in those humours  which shall be as little as possible  for after a while  if let alone  i always come to myself  and am sorry for the violence of a temper  so like my dear sister s here  and  for this reason think it is no matter how few witnesses i have of its intemperance  while it lasts  especially since every witness  whether they merit it or not  as you see in my pamela s case  must be a sufferer by it  if  unsent for  they come in my way he repeated the same lesson to me again  and enforced it and owned  that he was angry with me in earnest  just then  though more with himself afterwards  for being so  but when  pamela  said he  you wanted to transfer all my displeasure upon yourself  it was so much braving me with your merit  as if i must soon end my anger  if placed there  or it was making it so light to you  that i was truly displeased  for continued he  i cannot bear that you should wish  on any occasion whatever  to have me angry with you  or not to value my displeasure as the heaviest misfortune that could befall you but  sir  said i  you know  that what i did was to try to reconcile my lady  and  as she herself observed  it was paying her a high regard  it was so  replied he  but never think of making a compliment to her  or any body living  at my expense  besides  she had behaved herself so intolerably  that i began to think you had stooped too much  and more than i ought to permit my wife to do  and acts of meanness are what i can t endure in any body  but especially where i love  and as she had been guilty of a very signal one  i had much rather have renounced her at that time  than have been reconciled to her sir  said i  i hope i shall always comport myself so  as not wilfully to disoblige you for the future  and the rather do i hope this  as i am sure i shall want only to know your pleasure to obey it  but this instance shews me  that i may much offend  without designing it in the least now  pamela  replied he  don t be too serious  i hope i shan t be a very tyrannical husband to you  yet do i not pretend to be perfect  or to be always governed by reason in my first transports  and i expect  from your affection  that you will bear with me when you find me wrong  i have no ungrateful spirit  and can  when cool  enter as impartially into myself as most men  and then i am always kind and acknowledging  in proportion as i have been out of the way but to convince you  my dear  continued he  of your fault  i mean  with regard to the impetuosity of my temper  for there was no fault in your intention  that i acknowledge  i ll observe only  that you met  when you came to me  while i was so out of humour  a reception you did not expect  and a harsh word or two that you did not deserve  now  had you not broken in upon me while my anger lasted  but staid till i had come to you  or sent to desire your company  you d have seen none of this but that affectionate behaviour  which i doubt not you ll always merit and i shall always take pleasure in expressing  and in this temper shall you always find a proper influence over me  but you must not suppose whenever i am out of humour  that  in opposing yourself to my passion you oppose a proper butt to it  but when you are so good  like the slender reed  to bend to the hurricane  rather than  like the sturdy oak  to resist it  you will always stand firm in my kind opinion  while a contrary conduct would uproot you  with all your excellencies  from my soul sir  said i  i will endeavour to conform myself  in all things  to your will  i make no doubt but you will  and i ll endeavour to make my will as conformable to reason as i can  and let me tell you  that this belief of you is one of the inducements i have had to marry at all  for nobody was more averse to this state than myself  and  now we are upon this subject  i ll tell you why i was so averse we people of fortune  or such as are born to large expectations  of both sexes  are generally educated wrong  you have occasionally touched upon this  pamela  several times in your journal  so justly  that i need say the less to you  we are usually so headstrong  so violent in our wills that we very little bear control humoured by our nurses  through the faults of our parents  we practise first upon them  and shew the gratitude of our dispositions  in an insolence that ought rather to be checked and restrained  than encouraged next  we are to be indulged in every thing at school  and our masters and mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our boisterous behaviour but  in our wise parents  eyes  all looks well  all is forgiven and excused  and for no other reason  but because we are theirs our next progression is  we exercise our spirits  when brought home to the torment and regret of our parents themselves  and torture their hearts by our undutiful and perverse behaviour to them  which  however ungrateful in us  is but the natural consequence of their culpable indulgence to us  from infancy upwards and then  next  after we have  perhaps  half broken their hearts  a wife is looked out for  convenience  or birth  or fortune  are the first motives  affection the last if it is at all consulted  and two people thus educated  thus trained up  in a course of unnatural ingratitude and who have been headstrong torments to every one who has had a share in their education  as well as to those to whom they owe their being are brought together  and what can be expected  but that they should pursue  and carry on  the same comfortable conduct in matrimony  and join most heartily to plague one another  and  in some measure  indeed this is right  because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who have been aggrieved and insulted by them  upon one another the gentleman has never been controlled  the lady has never been contradicted he cannot bear it from one whose new relation  he thinks  should oblige her to shew a quite contrary conduct she thinks it very barbarous  now  for the first time  to be opposed in her will  and that by a man from whom she expected nothing but tenderness so great is the difference between what they both expect from one another  and what they both find in each other  that no wonder misunderstandings happen  that these ripen to quarrels  that acts of unkindness pass  which  even had the first motive to their union been affection  as usually it is not  would have effaced all manner of tender impressions on both sides appeals to parents or guardians often ensue  if  by mediation of friends  a reconciliation takes place  it hardly ever holds  for why the fault is in the minds of both  and neither of them will think so so that the wound not permitted to be probed  is but skinned over  and rankles still at the bottom  and at last breaks out with more pain and anguish than before  separate beds are often the consequence  perhaps elopements  if not  an unconquerable indifference  possibly aversion and whenever  for appearance sake  they are obliged to be together every one sees  that the yawning husband  and the vapourish wife  are truly insupportable to one another  but separate  have freer spirits and can be tolerable company now  my dear  i would have you think  and i hope you will have no other reason  that had i married the first lady in the land  i would not have treated her better than i will my pamela  for my wife is my wife  and i was the longer in resolving on the state  because i knew its requisites and doubted my conduct in it i believe i am more nice than many gentlemen  but it is because i have been a close observer of the behaviour of wedded folks  and hardly ever have seen it to be such as i could like in my own case  i shall possibly  give you instances of a more particular nature of this  as we are longer  and  perhaps  i might say  better acquainted had i married with the views of many gentlemen  and with such as my good sister supplying the place of my father and mother  would have recommended  i had wedded a fine lady  brought up pretty much in my own manner  and used to have her will in every thing some gentlemen can come into a compromise  and  after a few struggles sit down tolerably contented  but  had i married a princess  i could not have done so  i must have loved her exceedingly well  before i had consented to knit the knot with her  and preferred her to all her sex for without this  pamela  indifferences  if not disgusts  will arise in every wedded life  that could not have made me happy at home  and there are fewer instances  i believe  of men s loving better  after matrimony than of women s  the reason of which tis not my present purpose to account for then i must have been morally sure  that she preferred me to all men and  to convince me of this  she must have lessened  not aggravated my failings  she must have borne with my imperfections  she must have watched and studied my temper  and if ever she had any points to carry  any desire of overcoming  it must have been by sweetness and complaisance  and yet not such a slavish one  as should make her condescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility  than judgment or affection she should not have given cause for any part of my conduct to her to wear the least aspect of compulsion or force  the word command  on my side  or obedience on hers  i would have blotted from my vocabulary  for this reason i should have thought it my duty to have desired nothing of her  that was not significant  reasonable  or just  and that then she should  on hers  have shewn no reluctance  uneasiness  or doubt  to oblige me  even at half a word i would not have excused her to let me twice enjoin the same thing while i took so much care to make her compliance with me reasonable  and such as should not destroy her own free agency  in points that ought to be allowed her  and if i was not always right  that yet she would bear with me  if she saw me set upon it  and expostulate with me on the right side of compliance  for that would shew me  supposing small points in dispute  from which the greatest quarrels  among friends  generally arise  that she differed from me  not for contradiction sake  but desired to convince me for my own  and that i should  another time  take better resolutions this would be so obliging a conduct  that i should  in justice  have doubled my esteem for one  who  to humour me  could give up her own judgment  and i should see she could have no other view in her expostulations  after her compliance had passed  than to rectify my motions for the future  and it would have been impossible then  but i must have paid the greater deference to her opinion and advice in more momentous matters in all companies she must have shewn  that she had  whether i deserved it altogether or not  a high regard and opinion of me  and this the rather  as such a conduct in her would be a reputation and security to herself  for if we rakes attempt a married lady  our first encouragement  exclusive of our own vanity  arises from the indifferent opinion  slight  or contempt  she expresses of her husband i should expect  therefore  that she should draw a kind veil over my faults  that such as she could not hide  she would extenuate  that she would place my better actions in an advantageous light  and shew that i had her good opinion  at least  whatever liberties the world took with my character she must have valued my friends for my sake  been cheerful and easy whomsoever i had brought home with me  and  whatever faults she had observed in me  have never blamed me before company  at least  with such an air of superiority  as should have shewn she had a better opinion of her own judgment  than of mine now  my pamela  this is but a faint sketch of the conduct i must have expected from my wife  let her quality have been what it would  or have lived with her on bad terms  judge then  if to me a lady of the modish taste could have been tolerable the perverseness and contradiction i have too often seen  in some of my visits  even among people of sense  as well as condition  had prejudiced me to the married state  and  as i knew i could not bear it  surely i was in the right to decline it  and you see  my dear  that i have not gone among this class of people for a wife  nor know i  indeed  where in any class  i could have sought one  or had one suitable to my mind if not you  for here is my misfortune  i could not have been contented to have been but moderately happy in a wife judge you  from all this  if i could very well bear that you should think yourself so well secured of my affection  that you could take the faults of others upon yourself  and  by a supposed supererogatory merit think your interposition sufficient to atone for the faults of others yet am i not perfect myself  no  i am greatly imperfect  yet will i not allow  that my imperfections shall excuse those of my wife  or make her think i ought to bear faults in her  that she can rectify  because she bears greater from me upon the whole  i may expect  that you will bear with me  and study my temper  till  and only till  you see i am capable of returning insult for obligation  and till you think  that i shall be of a gentler deportment  if i am roughly used  than otherwise  one thing more i will add  that i should scorn myself  if there was one privilege of your sex  that a princess might expect  as my wife  to be indulged in  that i would not allow to my pamela  for you are the wife of my affections  i never wished for one before you  nor ever do i hope to have another i hope  sir  said i  my future conduct pardon me  said he  my dear  for interrupting you  but it is to assure you  that i am so well convinced of your affectionate regard for me  that i know i might have spared the greatest part of what i have said  and  indeed  it must be very bad for both of us  if i should have reason to think it necessary to say so much  but one thing has brought on another  and i have rather spoken what my niceness has made me observe in other families  than what i fear in my own  and  therefore  let me assure you  i am thoroughly satisfied with your conduct hitherto  you shall have no occasion to repent it  and you shall find  though greatly imperfect  and passionate  on particular provocations  which yet i will try to overcome  that you have not a brutal or ungenerous husband  who is capable of offering insult for condescension  or returning evil for good i thanked him for these kind rules  and generous assurances  and assured him  that they had made so much impression on my mind  that these  and his most agreeable injunctions before given me  and such as he should hereafter be pleased to give me  should be so many rules for my future behaviour and i am glad of the method i have taken of making a journal of all that passes in these first stages of my happiness  because it will sink the impression still deeper  and i shall have recourse to them for my better regulation  as often as i shall mistrust my memory let me see  what are the rules i am to observe from this awful lecture why these  that i must not  when he is in great wrath with any body  break in upon him without his leave  well  i ll remember it  i warrant  but yet i think this rule is almost peculiar to himself  that i must think his displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall me  to be sure i shall  and so that i must not wish to incur it  to save any body else  i ll be further if i do  that i must never make a compliment to any body at his expense  that i must not be guilty of any acts of wilful meanness  there is a great deal meant in this  and i ll endeavour to observe it all  to be sure  the occasion on which he mentions this  explains it  that i must say nothing  though in anger  that is spiteful or malicious  that is disrespectful or undutiful  and such like  that i must bear with him  even when i find him in the wrong  this is a little hard  as the case may be i wonder whether poor miss sally godfrey be living or dead  that i must be as flexible as the reed in the fable  lest  by resisting the tempest  like the oak  i be torn up by the roots  well i ll do the best i can there is no great likelihood  i hope  that i should be too perverse  yet sure  the tempest will not lay me quite level with the ground  neither  that the education of young people of condition is generally wrong memorandum  that if any part of children s education fall to my lot  i never indulge and humour them in things that they ought to be restrained in  that i accustom them to bear disappointments and control  that i suffer them not to be too much indulged in their infancy  nor at school  nor spoil them when they come home  for that children generally extend their perverseness from the nurse to the schoolmaster  from the schoolmaster to the parents  and  in their next step  as a proper punishment for all  make their ownselves unhappy  that undutiful and perverse children make bad husbands and wives and  collaterally  bad masters and mistresses  that  not being subject to be controlled early  they cannot  when married  bear one another  that the fault lying deep  and in the minds of each other  neither will mend it  whence follow misunderstandings  quarrels  appeals  ineffectual reconciliations  separations  elopements  or  at best  indifference perhaps  aversion memorandum  a good image of unhappy wedlock  in the words yawning husband  and vapourish wife  when together  but separate both quite alive  few married persons behave as he likes  let me ponder this with awe and improvement  some gentlemen can compromise with their wives  for quietness sake but he can t  indeed i believe that s true  i don t desire he should  that love before marriage is absolutely necessary  that there are fewer instances of men s than women s loving better after marriage  but why so  i wish he had given his reasons for this  i fancy they would not have been to the advantage of his own sex  that a woman give her husband reason to think she prefers him before all men  well  to be sure this should be so  that if she would overcome  it must be by sweetness and complaisance  that is  by yielding  he means  no doubt  yet not such a slavish one neither  as should rather seem the effect of her insensibility  than judgment or affection  that the words command and obey shall be blotted out of the vocabulary  very good  that a man should desire nothing of his wife  but what is significant  reasonable  just  to be sure  that is right  but then  that she must not shew reluctance  uneasiness  or doubt to oblige him  and that too at half a word  and must not be bid twice to do one thing  but may not there be some occasions  where this may be a little dispensed with  but he says afterwards  indeed  that this must be only while he took care to make her compliance reasonable  and consistent with her free agency  in points that ought to be allowed her  come  this is pretty well  considering  that if the husband be set upon a wrong thing  she must not dispute with him  but do it and  expostulate afterwards  good sirs  i don t know what to say to this  it looks a little hard  methinks  this would bear a smart debate  i fancy  in a parliament of women  but then he says  supposing they are only small points that are in dispute  well  this mends it a little  for small points  i think  should not be stood upon  that the greatest quarrels among friends and wives and husbands are  or should be  friends  arise from small matters  i believe this is very true  for i had like to have had anger here  when i intended very well  that a wife should not desire to convince her husband for contradiction sake  but for his own  as both will find their account in this  if one does  i believe tis very just  that in all companies a wife must shew respect and love to her husband  and this for the sake of her own reputation and security  for  that rakes cannot have a greater encouragement to attempt a married lady s virtue  than her slight opinion of her husband  to be sure this stands to reason  and is a fine lesson  that a wife should therefore draw a kind veil over her husband s faults  that such as she could not conceal  she should extenuate  that his virtues she should place in an advantageous light  and shew the world  that he had her good opinion at least  that she must value his friends for his sake  that she must be cheerful and easy in her behaviour  to whomsoever he brings home with him  that whatever faults she sees in him  she never blame him before company  at least  with such an air of superiority  as if she had a less opinion of his judgment than her own  that a man of nice observation cannot be contented to be only moderately happy in a wife  that a wife take care how she ascribe supererogatory merit to herself  so as to take the faults of others upon her indeed  i think it is well if we can bear our own  this is of the same nature with the third  and touches upon me  on the present occasion  for this wholesome lecture  that his imperfections must not be a plea for hers  to be sure  tis no matter how good the women are  but tis to be hoped men will allow a little  but  indeed  he says  that a husband  who expects all this  is to be incapable of returning insult for obligation  or evil for good  and ought not to abridge her of any privilege of her sex well  my dear parents  i think this last rule crowns the rest  and makes them all very tolerable  and a generous man  and a man of sense  cannot be too much obliged  and  as i have this happiness  i shall be very unworthy  if i do not always so think  and so act yet  after all  you ll see i have not the easiest task in the world  but i know my own intentions  that i shall not wilfully err  and so fear the less not one hint did he give  that i durst lay hold of  about poor miss sally godfrey  i wish my lady had not spoken of it  for it has given me a curiosity that is not quite so pretty in me  especially so early in my nuptials  and in a case so long ago past  yet he intimated too  to his sister  that he had had other faults  of this sort  i suppose  that had not come to her knowledge but i make no doubt he has seen his error  and will be very good for the future  i wish it  and pray it may be so  for his own dear sake wednesday  the seventh when i arose in the morning  i went to wait on lady davers  seeing her door open  and she was in bed  but awake  and talking to her woman  i said  i hope i don t disturb your ladyship  not at all  said she  i am glad to see you  how do you do  well  added she  when do you set out for bedfordshire i said  i can t tell  madam  it was designed as to day but i have heard no more of it sit down  said she  on the bed side i find  by the talk we had yesterday and last night  you have had but a poor time of it  pamela  i must call you so yet  said she  since you were brought to this house till within these few days  and mrs  jewkes too has given beck such an account  as makes me pity you indeed  madam  said i  if your ladyship knew all  you would pity me  for never poor creature was so hard put to it  but i ought to forget it all now  and be thankful why  said she  as far as i can find  tis a mercy you are here now  i was sadly moved with some part of your story and you have really made a noble defence  and deserve the praises of all our sex it was god enabled me  madam  replied i  why  said she  tis the more extraordinary  because i believe  if the truth was known  you loved the wretch not a little  while my trials lasted  madam  said i  i had not a thought of any thing  but to preserve my innocence  much less of love but  tell me truly  said she  did you not love him all the time  i had always  madam  answered i  a great reverence for my master  and thought all his good actions doubly good and for his naughty ones  though i abhorred his attempts upon me  yet i could not hate him  and always wished him well  but i did not know that it was love  indeed i had not the presumption sweet girl  said she  that s prettily said  but when he found he could not gain his ends  and began to be sorry for your sufferings  and to admire your virtue  and to profess honourable love to you  what did you think think  indeed  madam  i did not know what to think  could neither hope nor believe so great an honour would fall to my lot  and feared more from his kindness  for some time  than i had done from his unkindness and  having had a private intimation  from a kind friend  of a sham marriage  intended by means of a man who was to personate a minister  it kept my mind in too much suspense  to be greatly overjoyed at his kind declaration said she  i think he did make two or three attempts upon you in bedfordshire  yes  madam  said i  he was very naughty  to be sure and here he proposed articles to you  i understand  yes  madam  replied i  but i abhorred so much the thoughts of being a kept creature  that i rejected them with great boldness  and was resolved to die before i would consent to them he afterwards attempted you  i think  did he not  o yes  madam  said i a most sad attempt he made  and i had like to have been lost  for mrs  jewkes was not so good as she should have been  and so i told her ladyship that sad affair  and how i fell into fits  and that they believing me dying  forbore any attempts after this base one  she said he was not so good as he should have been  returned i  once in the garden  afterwards  but i was so watchful  and so ready to take the alarm but  said she  did he not threaten you  at times  and put on his stern airs  every now and then threaten  madam  replied i  yes  i had enough of that  i thought i should have died for fear several times how could you bear that  said she  for he is a most daring and majestic mortal  he has none of your puny hearts  but is as courageous as a lion  and  boy and man  never feared any thing  i myself  said she  have a pretty good spirit  but  when i have made him truly angry  i have always been forced to make it up with him  as well as i could  for  child  he is not one that is easily reconciled  i assure you but  after he had professed honourable love to you  did he never attempt you again no  indeed  madam  he did not  but he was a good while struggling with himself  and with his pride  as he was pleased to call it  before he could stoop so low  and considered  and considered again and once  upon my saying but two or three words  that displeased him when he was very kind to me  he turned me out of doors  in a manner at an hour s warning  for he sent me above a day s journey towards my father s  and then sent a man and horse  post haste  to fetch me back again  and has been exceedingly kind and gracious to me ever since  and made me happy that sending you away  said she  one hour  and sending after you the next  is exactly like my brother  and tis well if he don t turn you off twice or thrice before a year comes about  if you vex him  and he would have done the same by the first lady in the land  if he had been married to her  yet has he his virtues  as well as his faults  for he is generous  nay  he is noble in his spirit  hates little dirty actions  he delights in doing good  but does not pass over a wilful fault easily  he is wise  prudent  sober  and magnanimous  and will not tell a lie nor disguise his faults  but you must not expect to have him all to yourself  i doubt but i ll no more harp upon this string  you see how he was exasperated at me  and he seemed to be angry at you too  though something of it was art  i believe indeed  madam  said i  he has been pleased to give me a most noble lecture  and i find he was angry with me in earnest  and that it will not be an easy task to behave unexceptionably to him  for he is very nice and delicate in his notions  i perceive  but yet  as your ladyship says  exceeding generous well  said she  i m glad thou hadst a little bit of his anger  else i should have thought it art  and i don t love to be treated with low art any more than he  and i should have been vexed if he had done it by me but i understand  child  said she  that you keep a journal of all matters that pass  and he has several times found means to get at it should you care i should see it  it could not be to your disadvantage for i find it had no small weight with him in your favour  and i should take great pleasure to read all his stratagems  attempts  contrivances menaces  and offers to you  on one hand  and all your pretty counter plottings  which he much praises  your resolute resistance  and the noble stand you have made to preserve your virtue  and the steps by which his pride was subdued  and his mind induced to honourable love till you were made what you now are  for it must be a rare and uncommon story  and will not only give me great pleasure in reading  but will entirely reconcile me to the step he has taken  and that  let me tell you  is what i never thought to be  for i had gone a great way in bringing about a match with him and lady betty  and had said so much of it  that the earl  her father  approved of it  and so did the duke of  her uncle  and lady betty herself was not averse  and now i shall be hunted to death about it  and this has made me so outrageous as you have seen me upon the matter  but when i can find  by your writings that your virtue is but suitably rewarded  it will be not only a good excuse for me  but for him  and make me love you  there is nothing that i would not do  said i  to oblige your ladyship  but my poor father and mother who would rather have seen me buried quick in the earth  than to be seduced by the greatest of princes  have them in their hands at present  and your dear brother has bespoken them  when they have done reading them  but  if he gives me leave  i will shew them to your ladyship  with all my heart  not doubting your generous allowances  as i have had his  though i have treated him very freely all the way  while he had naughty views  and that your ladyship would consider them as the naked sentiments of my heart  from time to time delivered to those whose indulgence i was sure of  and for whose sight only they were written give me a kiss now  said her ladyship  for your cheerful compliance  for i make no doubt my brother will consent i shall see them  because they must needs make for your honour  and i see he loves you better than any one in the world i have heard  continued her ladyship  a mighty good character of your parents  as industrious  honest  sensible  good folks  who know the world  and  as i doubt not my brother s generosity  i am glad they will make no ill figure in the world s eye madam  said i  they are the honestest  the lovingest  and the most conscientious couple breathing  they once lived creditably  and brought up a great family  of which i am the youngest  but had misfortunes through their doing beyond their power for two unhappy brothers  who are both dead  and whose debts they stood bound for  and so became reduced and  by harsh creditors  where most of the debts were  not of their own contracting  turned out of all  and having  without success  tried to set up a little country school  for my father understood a little of accounts  and wrote a pretty good hand  forced to take to hard labour but honest all the time  contented  never repining  and loving to one another  and  in the midst of their poverty and disappointments  above all temptation  and all their fear was  that i should be wicked  and yield to temptation for the sake of worldly riches and to god s grace and their good lessons  and those i imbibed from my dear good lady your ladyship s mother  it is that i owe the preservation of my innocence and the happy station i am exalted to she was pleased to kiss me again  and said  there is such a noble simplicity in thy story  such an honest artlessness in thy mind  and such a sweet humility in thy deportment  notwithstanding thy present station  that i believe i shall be forced to love thee  whether i will or not  and the sight of your papers  i dare say  will crown the work will disarm my pride  banish my resentment on lady betty s account  and justify my brother s conduct  and  at the same time  redound to your own everlasting honour  as well as to the credit of our sex  and so i make no doubt but my brother will let me see them worden  said my lady  i can say any thing before you  and you will take no notice of our conversation  but i see you are much touched with it did you ever hear any thing prettier  more unaffected  sincere  free easy no  never  madam  answered she  in my life  and it is a great pleasure to see so happy a reconciliation taking place  where there is so much merit i said  i have discovered so much prudence in mrs  worden  that  as well for that  as for the confidence your ladyship places in her  i have made no scruple of speaking my mind freely before her  and of blaming my dear master while he was blameworthy  as well as acknowledging his transcendent goodness to me since  which  i am sure  exceeds all i can ever deserve  may be not  said my lady  i hope you ll be very happy in one another  and i ll now rise  and tell him my thoughts  and ask him to let me have the reading of your papers  for i promise myself much pleasure in them  and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you  to the other house  to fetch them your ladyship s favour  said i  was all i had to wish for  and if i have that  and the continuance of your dear brother s goodness to me  i shall be easy under whatever else may happen and so i took my leave  and withdrew  and she let me hear her say to mrs  worden  tis a charming creature  worden i know not which excels her person  or her mind and so young a creature too well may my brother love her i am afraid  my dear father and mother  i shall now be too proud indeed i had once a good mind to have asked her ladyship about miss sally godfrey  but i thought it was better let alone  since she did not mention it herself  may be i shall hear it too soon  but i hope not  i wonder  though  whether she be living or dead we breakfasted together with great good temper  and my lady was very kind  and  asking my good master  he gave leave very readily  she should see all my papers  when you returned them to me  and he said  he was sure  when she came to read them  she would say  that i had well deserved the fortune i had met with  and would be of opinion  that all the kindness of his future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for my virtue  and make me amends for my sufferings my lady resolving to set out the next morning to return to her lord  my master ordered every thing to be made ready for his doing the like to bedfordshire  and this evening our good neighbours will sup with us  to take leave of my lady and us wednesday night nothing particular having passed at dinner or supper  but the most condescending goodness  on my lady s side  to me  and the highest civilities from mr  peters s family  from lady jones  from sir simon s family  etc  and reciprocal good wishes all around  and a promise obtained from my benefactor  that he would endeavour to pass a fortnight or three weeks in these parts  before the winter set in  i shall conclude this day with observing  that i disposed of the money my master was so good to put into my hands  in the manner he was pleased to direct  and i gave mrs  jewkes hers in such a manner as highly pleased her  and she wished me  with tears  all kinds of happiness  and prayed me to forgive her all her wickedness to me  as she herself called it  i begged leave of my master to present mrs  worden with five guineas for a pair of gloves  which he said was well thought of i should have mentioned  that miss darnford and i agreed upon a correspondence  which will be no small pleasure to me  for she is an admirable young lady  whom i prefer to every one i have seen  and i shall  i make no doubt  improve by her letters  for she is said to have a happy talent in writing  and is well read  for so young a lady saturday on thursday morning my lady set out for her own seat  and my best friend and i  attended by mr  colbrand  abraham  and thomas  for this dear house  her ladyship parted with her brother and me with great tenderness  and made me promise to send her my papers  which i find she intends to entertain lady betty with  and another lady or two  her intimates  as also her lord  and hopes to find  as i believe  in the reading of them  some excuse for her brother s choice my dearest master has been all love and tenderness on the road  as he is in every place  and on every occasion  and oh  what a delightful change was this journey  to that which  so contrary to all my wishes  and so much to my apprehensions  carried me hence to the lincolnshire house and how did i bless god at every turn  and at every stage we did not arrive here till yesterday noon  abraham rode before  to let them know we were coming  and i had the satisfaction to find every body there i wished to see when the chariot entered the court yard  i was so strongly impressed with the favour and mercies of god almighty  on remembering how i was sent away the last time i saw this house  the leave i took  the dangers i had encountered  a poor cast off servant girl  and now returning a joyful wife  and the mistress  through his favour  of the noble house i was turned out of  that i was hardly able to support the joy i felt in my mind on the occasion  he saw how much i was moved  and tenderly asked me  why i seemed so affected  i told him  and lifted his dear hand to my lips  and said  o sir  god s mercies  and your goodness to me on entering this dear  dear place  are above my expression  i can hardly bear the thoughts of them he said  welcome  thrice welcome  joy of my life  to your own house  and kissed my hand in return  all the common servants stood at the windows  as unseen as they could  to observe us he took my hand  with the most condescending goodness in the world  and with great complaisance  led me into the parlour  and kissed me with the greatest ardour  welcome again  my dearest life  said he  a thousand times welcome to the possession of a house that is not more mine than yours i threw myself at his feet  permit me  dear sir  thus to bless god  and thank you  for all his mercies and your goodness  o may i so behave  as not to be utterly unworthy  and then how happy shall i be  god give me my dearest  said he  life and health to reward all your sweetness  and no man can be so blest as i where said he to abraham  who passed by the door  where is mrs jervis she bolted in  here  good sir  said she  here  good madam  am i  waiting impatiently  till called for  to congratulate you both i ran to her  and clasped my arms about her neck  and kissed her  o my dear mrs  jervis  said i  my other dear mother  receive your happy happy pamela  and join with me to bless god  and bless our master  for all these great things i was ready to sink in her arms through excess of joy  to see the dear good woman  who had been so often a mournful witness of my distress  as now of my triumph dearest madam  said she you do me too much honour  let my whole life shew the joy i take in your deserved good fortune  and in my duty to you  for the early instance i received of your goodness in your kind letter  o mrs  jervis  replied i  there all thanks are due  both from you and me  for our dear master granted me this blessing  as i may justly call it  the very first moment i begged it of him  your goodness  sir  said she  i will for ever acknowledge  and i beg pardon for the wrong step i made in applying to my lady davers he was so good as to salute her  and said  all is over now  mrs  jervis  and i shall not remember you ever disobliged me  i always respected you  and shall now more and more value you  for the sake of that dear good creature  whom  with joy unfeigned  i can call my wife  god bless your honour for ever  said she  and many many happy years may ye live together  the envy and wonder of all who know you but where  said my dear master  is honest longman  and where is jonathan come  mrs  jervis  said i  you shall shew me them  and all the good folks  presently  and let me go up with you to behold the dear apartments  which i have seen before with such different emotions to what i shall now do we went up  and in every room  the chamber i took refuge in  when my master pursued me  my lady s chamber  her dressing room  mrs  jervis s room  not forgetting her closet  my own little bed chamber  the green room  and in each of the others  i blessed god for my past escapes  and present happiness  and the good woman was quite affected with the zeal and pleasure with which i made my thankful acknowledgments to the divine goodness  o my excellent lady  said she  you are still the same good  pious  humble soul i knew you  and your marriage has added to your graces  as i hope it will to your blessings dear mrs  jervis  said i  you know not what i have gone through  you know not what god has done for me  you know not what a happy creature i am now  i have a thousand thousand things to tell you  and a whole week will be too little  every moment of it spent in relating to you what has befallen me  to make you acquainted with it all  we shall be sweetly happy together  i make no doubt  but i charge you  my dear mrs  jervis whatever you call me before strangers  that when we are by ourselves you call me nothing but your pamela  for what an ungrateful creature should i be  who have received so many mercies  if i attributed them not to the divine goodness  but assumed to myself insolent airs upon them  no  i hope i shall be  more and more thankful  as i am more and more blest and more humble  as god  the author of all my happiness  shall more distinguish me we went down again to the parlour  to my dear master  said he  call longman in again  he longs to see you  my dear  he came in  god bless you  my sweet lady  said he  as now  heaven be praised  i may call you did i not tell you  madam  that providence would find you out  o  mr longman  said i  god be praised for all his mercies  i am rejoiced to see you  and i laid my hand on his  and said  good mr  longman  how do you do i must always value you  and you don t know how much of my present happiness i owe to the sheets of paper  and pens and ink  you furnished me with  i hope my dear sir and you are quite reconciled o madam  said he  how good you are  why  i cannot contain myself for joy and then he wiped his eyes  good man said my master  yes  i have been telling longman that i am obliged to him for his ready return to me  and that i will entirely forget his appeal to lady davers  and i hope he ll find himself quite as easy and happy as he wishes  my dear partner here  mr  longman  i dare promise you  will do all she can to make you so heaven bless you both together  said he  tis the pride of my heart to see this  i returned with double delight  when i heard the blessed news  and i am sure  sir said he  mark old longman s words  god will bless you for this every year more and more  you don t know how many hearts you have made happy by this generous deed i am glad of it  said my dear master  i am sure i have made my own happy  and  longman  though i must think you somebody  yet  as you are not a young man  and so won t make me jealous i can allow you to wish my dear wife joy in the tenderest manner  adad sir  said he  i am sure you rejoice me with your favour  tis what i longed for  but durst not presume  my dear  said my master  receive the compliment of one of the honestest hearts in england  that always revered your virtues and the good man saluted me with great respect and said  god in heaven bless you both  and kneeled on one knee  i must quit your presence  indeed i must and away he went your goodness  sir  said i  knows no bounds  o may my gratitude never find any i saw  said my master  when the good man approached you  that he did it with so much awe and love mingled together  that i fancied he longed to salute my angel  and i could not but indulge his honest heart  how blessed am i  said i  and kissed his hand and indeed i make nothing now of kissing his dear hand  as if it was my own when honest old mr  jonathan come in to attend at dinner  so clean  so sleek  and so neat  as he always is  with his silver hair  i said  well mr  jonathan  how do you do  i am glad to see you you look as well as ever  thank god  o  dear madam  said he  better than ever  to have such a blessed sight  god bless you and my good master and i hope  sir said he  you ll excuse all my past failings  ay  that i will  jonathan said he  because you never had any  but what your regard for my dear wife here was the occasion of  and now i can tell you  you can never err  because you cannot respect her too much  o sir  said he  your honour is exceeding good  i m sure i shall always pray for you both after dinner  mr  longman coming in  and talking of some affairs under his care  he said afterwards  all your honour s servants are now happy for robert  who left you  had a pretty little fortune fallen to him  or he never would have quitted your service  he was here but yesterday  to inquire when you and my lady returned hither  and hoped he might have leave to pay his duty to you both  ay  said my master  i shall be glad to see honest robert  for that s another of your favourites  pamela  it was high time  i think  i should marry you  were it but to engage the respects of all my family to myself there are  sir  said i  ten thousand reasons why i should rejoice in your goodness but i was going to say  said mr  longman  that all your honour s old servants are now happy  but one  you mean john arnold  said my master  i do  indeed  said he  if you ll excuse me  sir  o  said i  i have had my prayer for poor john answered  as favourably as i could wish why  said mr  longman  to be sure poor john has acted no very good part  take it altogether  but he so much honoured you  sir  and so much respected you madam  that he would have been glad to have been obedient to both  and so was faithful to neither  but  indeed  the poor fellow s heart is almost broke  and he won t look out for any other place  and says he must live in your honour s service  or he must die wretched very shortly  mrs  jervis was there when this was said  indeed  said she  the poor man has been here every day since he heard the tidings  that have rejoiced us all  and he says  he hopes he shall yet be forgiven  is he in the house now  said my master  he is  sir  and was here when your honour came in  and played at hide and seek to have one look at you both when you alighted  and was ready to go out of his wits for joy  when we saw your honour hand my lady in  pamela  said my dear master  you re to do with john as you please  you have full power  then pray  sir  said i let poor john come in the poor fellow came in  with so much confusion  that i have never seen a countenance that expressed so lively a consciousness of his faults and mingled joy and shame  how do you do  john  said i  i hope you are very well the poor fellow could hardly speak  and looked with awe upon my master  and pleasure upon me  said my master  well  john  there is no room to say any thing to a man that has so much concern already  i am told you will serve me whether i will or not  but i turn you over altogether to my spouse here  and she is to do by you as she pleases you see  john  said i  your good master s indulgence  well may i forgive  that have so generous an example  i was always persuaded of your honest intentions  if you had known how to distinguish between your duty to your master  and your good will to me  you will now have no more puzzles on that account  from the goodness of your dear master  i shall be but too happy i said the poor man  god bless your honour  god bless you  madam i now have the joy of my soul  in serving you both  and i will make the best of servants  to my power  well  then  john  said i your wages will go on  as if you had not left your master  may i not say so  sir  said i  yes  surely  my dear  replied he  and augment them too if you find his duty to you deserves it  a thousand millions of thanks said the poor man  i am very well satisfied  and desire no augmentation and so he withdrew  overjoyed  and mrs  jervis and mr  longman were highly pleased  for though they were incensed against him for his fault to me  when matters looked badly for me  yet they  and all his fellow servants  always loved john when mr  longman and mrs  jervis had dined  they came in again  to know if he had any commands  and my dear master  filling a glass of wine said  longman  i am going to toast the happiest and honestest couple in england  my dear pamela s father and mother thank you  dear sir  said i i think  continued he  that little kentish purchase wants a manager  and as it is a little out of your way  longman  i have been purposing  if i thought mr  andrews would accept it  that he should enter upon hodge s farm that was  and so manage for me that whole little affair  and we will well stock the farm for him  and make it comfortable  and i think if he will take that trouble upon him  it will be an ease to you  and a favour to me your honour  said he  cannot do a better thing  and i have had some inkling given me  that you may  if you please  augment that estate  by a purchase  of equal amount  contiguous to it  and as you have so much money to spare  i can t see your honour can do better  well  said he let me have the particulars another time  and we will consider about it  but  my dear  added he  you ll mention this to your father  if you please i have too much money  longman  continued he  lies useless  though  upon this occasion  i shall not grudge laying out as much in liveries and other things  as if i had married a lady of a fortune equal  if possible  to my pamela s merit  and i reckon you have a good deal in hand  yes  sir  said he  more than i wish i had  but i have a mortgage in view  if you don t buy that kentish thing  that i believe will answer very well  and when matters are riper  will mention it to your honour i took with me  to lincolnshire  said my master  upwards of six hundred guineas  and thought to have laid most of them out there  thank god thought i  you did not  for he offered me five hundred of them  you know  but i have not laid out above two hundred and fifty of them  so two hundred i left there in my escritoire  because i shall go again for a fortnight or so  before winter  and two hundred i have brought with me  and i have money  i know not what  in three places here  the account of which is in my pocket book  in my library you have made some little presents  pamela  to my servants there  on our nuptials  and these two hundred that i have brought up  i will put into your disposal  that  with some of them  you shall do here as you did there i am ashamed  good sir  said i  to be so costly  and so worthless  pray my dear  replied he  say not a word of that  said mr  longman  why madam  with money in stocks  and one thing or another  his honour could buy half the gentlemen around him  he wants not money  and lays up every year  and it would have been pity but his honour should have wedded just as he has  very true  longman  said my master  and  pulling out his purse  said  tell out  my dear  two hundred guineas  and give me the rest i did so  now  said he  take them yourself  for the purposes i mentioned  but  mr  longman  do you  before sunset  bring my dear girl fifty pounds  which is due to her this day  by my promise  and every three months  from this day  pay her fifty pounds  which will be two hundred pounds per annum  and this is for her to lay out at her own discretion  and without account  in such a way as shall derive a blessing upon us all  for she was my mother s almoner  and shall be mine  and her own too i ll go for it this instant  said mr  longman when he was done  i looked upon my dear generous master  and on mrs jervis  and he gave me a nod of assent  and i took twenty guineas and said  dear mrs  jervis  accept of this  which is no more than my generous master ordered me to present to mrs  jewkes  for a pair of gloves  on my happy nuptials  and so you  who are much better entitled to them by the love i bear you  must not refuse them said she  mrs  jewkes was on the spot  madam  at the happy time  yes said my master  but pamela would have rejoiced to have had you there instead of her  that i should  sir  replied i  or instead of any body except my own mother  she gratefully accepted them  and thanked us both but i don t know what she should thank me for  for i was not worth a fourth of them myself i d have you  my dear  said he  in some handsome manner  as you know how  oblige longman to accept of the like present mr  longman returned from his office  and brought me the fifty pounds saying  i have entered this new article with great pleasure  to my lady fifty pounds  to be paid the same sum quarterly  o sir  said i what will become of me  to be so poor in myself  and so rich in your bounty it is a shame to take all that your profuse goodness would heap upon me thus  but indeed it shall not be without account make no words  my dear  said he  are you not my wife  and have i not endowed you with my goods  and  hitherto  this is a very small part mr  longman  said i  and mrs  jervis  you both see how i am even oppressed with unreturnable obligations  god bless the donor  and the receiver too  said mr  longman  i am sure they will bring back good interest  for  madam  you had ever a bountiful heart  and i have seen the pleasure you used to take to dispense my late lady s alms and donations i ll warrant  mr  longman  said i  notwithstanding you are so willing to have me take large sums for nothing at all  i should affront you  if i asked you to accept from me a pair of gloves only  on account of my happy nuptials  he seemed not readily to know how to answer  and my master said  if longman refuse you  my dear  he may be said to refuse your first favour  on that i put twenty guineas in his hand  but he insisted upon it  that he would take but five  i said  i must desire you to oblige me  mr  longman  or i shall think i have affronted you  well if i must  said he  i know what i know  what is that  mr  longman  said i why  madam  said he  i will not lay it out till my young master s birth day  which i hope will be within this twelvemonth not expecting anything like this from the old gentleman  i looked at my master  and then blushed so  i could not hold up my head  charmingly said  longman  said my master  and clasped me in his arms  o  my dear life  god send it may be so you have quite delighted me  longman though i durst not have said such a thing for the world madam  said the old gentleman  i beg your pardon  i hope no offence  but i d speak it ten times in a breath to have it so  take it how you please  as long as my good master takes it so well  mrs  jervis  said my master  this is an over nice dear creature  you don t know what a life i have had with her  even on this side matrimony said mrs  jervis  i think mr  longman says very well  i am sure i shall hope for it too mr  longman  who had struck me of a heap  withdrawing soon after  my master said  why  my dear  you can t look up  the old man said nothing shocking  i did not expect it  though  from him  said i  i was not aware but of some innocent pleasantry  why  so it was  said he  both innocent and pleasant  and i won t forgive you  if you don t say as he says come  speak before mrs  jervis  may every thing happen  sir  said i that will give you delight that s my dearest love  said he  and kissed me with great tenderness when the servants had dined  i desired to see the maidens  and all four came up together  you are welcome home  madam  said rachel  we rejoice all to see you here  and more to see you our lady  o my good old acquaintances  said i  i joy to see you  how do you do  rachel  how do you all do  and i took each of them by the hand  and could have kissed them  for  said i to myself  i kissed you all  last time i saw you  in sorrow  why should i not kiss you all with joy  but i forbore  in honour of their master s presence they seemed quite transported with me  and my good master was pleased with the scene  see here  my lasses  said he  your mistress  i need not bid you respect her  for you always loved her  and she ll have it as much in her power as inclination to be kind to the deserving  indeed said i  i shall always be a kind friend to you  and your dear master has ordered me to give each of you this  that you may rejoice with me on my happiness  and so i gave them five guineas a piece  and said  god bless you every one  i am overjoyed to see you  and they withdrew with the greatest gratitude and pleasure  praying for us both i turned to my dear master  tis to you  dear sir  said i  next to god who put it into your generous heart  that all my happiness is owing that my mind thus overflows with joy and gratitude  and i would have kissed his hand  but he clasped me in his arms  and said  you deserve it  my dear  you deserve it all  mrs  jervis came in  said she  i have seen a very affecting sight  you have made your maidens quite happy madam  with your kindness and condescension  i saw them all four  as i came by the hall door  just got up from their knees  praising and praying for you both  dear good bodies  said i  and did jane pray too may their prayers be returned upon themselves  i say my master sent for jonathan  and i held up all the fingers of my two hands  and my master giving a nod of approbation as he came in  i said well  mr  jonathan  i could not be satisfied without seeing you in form as it were  and thanking you for all your past good will to me  you ll accept of that  for a pair of gloves  on this happy occasion  and i gave him ten guineas  and took his honest hand between both mine  god bless you  said i  with your silver hairs  so like my dear father i shall always value such a good old servant of the best of masters he said  o such goodness  such kind words  it is balm to my heart  blessed be god i have lived to this day and his eyes swam in tears  and he withdrew my dear  said my master  you make every one happy o  sir said i  tis you  tis you  and let my grateful heart always spring to my lips  to acknowledge the blessings you heap upon me then in came harry  and isaac  and benjamin  and the two grooms of this house  and arthur the gardener  for my dear master had ordered them  by mrs  jervis  thus to be marshalled out  and he said  where s john  poor john was ashamed  and did not come in till he heard himself called for i said to them  how do you do  my old friends and fellow servants  i am glad to see you all my master said  i have given you a mistress  my lads  that is the joy of my heart  you see her goodness and condescension  let your respects to her be but answerable  and she ll be proportionately as great a blessing to you all  as she is to me  harry said  in the names of all your servants  sir  i bless your honour  and your good lady  and it shall be all our studies to deserve her ladyship s favours  as well as your honour s  and so i gave every one five guineas  to rejoice  as i said in my happiness when i came to john  i said  i saw you before  john  but i again tell you  i am glad to see you  he said  he was quite ashamed and confounded o  said i  forget every thing that s past  john your dear good master will  and so will i  for god has wonderfully brought about all these things  by the very means i once thought most grievous  let us therefore  look forward  and be only ashamed to commit faults for the time to come  for they may not always be attended with like happy consequences arthur  said my master  i have brought you a mistress that is a great gardener  she ll shew you a new way to plant beans  and never any body had such a hand at improving a sun flower as she o sir  sir  said i but yet a little dashed  all my improvements in every kind of thing are owing to you  i am sure and so i think i was even with the dear man  and yet appeared grateful before his servants  they withdrew blessing us both  as the rest had done  and then came in the postilion and two helpers  for my master has both here  and at lincolnshire  fine hunting horses  and it is the chief sport he takes delight in  as also the scullion boy  and i said  how do all of you  and how dost do  tommy i hope you re very good  here your dear master has ordered you something a piece  in honour of me  and my master holding three fingers to me  i gave the postilion and helpers three guineas each  and the little boy two  and bid him let his poor mother lay it out for him  for he must not spend it idly  mr  colbrand  abraham  and thomas  i had before presented at t other house and when they were all gone but mrs  jervis  i said  and now  dearest sir  permit me  on my knees  thus to bless you  and pray for you  and oh  may god crown you with length of days  and increase of honour and may your happy  happy pamela  by her grateful heart  appear always worthy in your dear eyes  though she cannot be so in her own  nor in those of any others mrs  jervis  said my master  you see the excellency of this sweet creature  and when i tell you that the charms of her person  all lovely as she is  bind me not so strongly to her  as the graces of her mind congratulate me  that my happiness is built on so stable a basis  indeed i do  most sincerely  sir  said she  this is a happy day to me i stept into the library  while he was thus pouring out his kindness for me to mrs  jervis  and blessed god there on my knees  for the difference i now found to what i had once known in it and when i have done the same in the first scene of my fears  the once frightful summer house i shall have gone through most of my distressful scenes with gratitude but shall never forbear thanking god in my mind  for his goodness to me in every one  mrs  jervis  i find  had whispered him what i had done above  and he saw me upon my knees  with my back towards him  unknown to me  but softly put to the door again  as he had opened it a little way and i said  not knowing he had seen me  you have some charming pictures here  sir yes  said he  my dear life  so i have  but none equal to that which your piety affords me  and may the god you delight to serve  bless more and more my dear angel sir  said i  you are all goodness i hope  replied he  after your sweet example  i shall be better and better do you think  my dear father and mother  there ever was so happy a creature as i  to be sure it would be very ungrateful to think with uneasiness  or any thing but compassion  of poor miss sally godfrey he ordered jonathan to let the evening be passed merrily  but wisely  as he said  with what every one liked  whether wine or october he was pleased afterwards to lead me up stairs  and gave me possession of my lady s dressing room and cabinet  and her fine repeating watch and equipage  and  in short  of a complete set of diamonds  that were his good mother s  as also of the two pair of diamond ear rings  the two diamond rings  and diamond necklace  he mentioned in his naughty articles  which her ladyship had intended for presents to miss tomlins a rich heiress  that was proposed for his wife  when he was just come from his travels  but which went off  after all was agreed upon on both the friends  sides  because he approved not her conversation  and she had  as he told his mother  too masculine an air  and he never could be brought to see her but once  though the lady liked him very well he presented me also with her ladyship s books  pictures  linen  laces etc  that were in her apartments  and bid me call those apartments mine o give me  my good god  humility and gratitude sunday night this day  as matters could not be ready for our appearance at a better place  we staid at home  and my dear master employed himself a good deal in his library  and i have been taken up pretty much  i hope  as i ought to be  in thankfulness  prayer and meditation  in my newly presented closet and i hope god will be pleased to give a blessing to me  for i have the pleasure to think i am not puffed up with this great alteration  and yet am i not wanting to look upon all these favours and blessings in the light wherein i ought to receive them  both at the hands of heaven  and my dear benefactor we dined together with great pleasure  and i had  in every word and action  all the instances of kindness and affection that the most indulged heart could wish  he said he would return to his closet again and at five o clock would come and take a walk with me in the garden and so retired as soon as he had dined  and i went up to mine about six  he was pleased to come up to me  and said  now  my dear  i will attend you for a little walk in the garden  and i gave him my hand with great pleasure this garden is much better cultivated than the lincolnshire one  but that is larger  and has nobler walks in it  and yet there is a pretty canal in this  and a fountain and cascade  we had a deal of sweet conversation as we walked  and  after we had taken a turn round  i bent towards the little garden  and when i came near the summer house  took the opportunity to slip from him  and just whipt up the steps of this once frightful place  and kneeled down  and said  i bless thee  o god for my escapes  and for thy mercies  o let me always possess a grateful humble heart  and i whipt down again and joined him  and he hardly missed me several of the neighbouring gentry sent their compliments to him on his return  but not a word about his marriage  particularly mr  arthur  mr towers  mr  brooks  and mr  martin of the grove monday i had a good deal of employment in choosing patterns for my new clothes he thought nothing too good  but i thought every thing i saw was  and he was so kind to pick out six of the richest for me to choose three suits out of  saying  we would furnish ourselves with more in town  when we went thither  one was white  flowered with silver most richly  and he was pleased to say  that  as i was a bride  i should make my appearance in that the following sunday  and so we shall have in two or three days from several places  nothing but mantua makers and tailors at work bless me  what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy i am to the dear gentleman but his fortune and station require a great deal of it and his value for me will not let him do less  than if he had married a fortune equal to his own  and then  as he says  it would be a reflection upon him  if he did and so i doubt it will be  as it is  for either way the world will have something to say  he made me also choose some very fine laces  and linen  and has sent a message on purpose  with his orders  to hasten all down  what can be done in town  as the millinery matters  etc  to be completed there  and sent by particular messengers as done  all to be here  and finished by saturday afternoon  without fail i sent away john this morning  with some more of my papers to you  and with the few he will give you separate  my desire is  that you will send me all the papers you have done with  that i may keep my word with lady davers  to beg the continuance of your prayers and blessings  to hope you will give me your answer about my dear benefactor s proposal of the kentish farm  to beg you to buy  two suits of clothes each  of the finest cloth for you  my dear father  and of a creditable silk for my dear mother  and good linen  and every thing answerable  and that you will  as my best friend bid me say  let us see you here as soon as possible  and he will have his chariot come for you  when you tell john the day  oh  how i long to see you both  my dear good parents  and to share with you my felicities you will have  i m sure  the goodness to go to all your creditors  which are chiefly those of my poor unhappy brothers  and get an account of all you are bound for  and every one shall be paid to the utmost farthing and interest besides  though some of them have been very cruel and unrelenting but they are entitled to their own  and shall be thankfully paid now i think of it  john shall take my papers down to this place  that you may have something to amuse you  of your dear child s  instead of those you part with  and i will continue writing till i am settled  and you are determined  and then i shall apply myself to the duties of the family  in order to become as useful to my dear benefactor  as my small abilities will let me if you think a couple of guineas will be of use to mrs  mumford  who i doubt  has not much aforehand  pray give them to her  from me  and i will return them to you  as for a pair of gloves on my nuptials  and look through your poor acquaintances and neighbours  and let me have a list of such honest industrious poor  as may be true objects of charity and have no other assistance  particularly such as are blind  lame or sickly  with their several cases  and also such poor families and housekeepers as are reduced by misfortunes  as ours was  and where a great number of children may keep them from rising to a state of tolerable comfort  and i will choose as well as i can  for i long to be making a beginning  with the kind quarterly benevolence my dear good benefactor has bestowed upon me for such good purposes i am resolved to keep account of all these matters  and mr  longman has already furnished me with a vellum book of white paper  some sides of which i hope soon to fill with the names of proper objects  and though my dear master has given me all this without account  yet shall he see but nobody else  how i lay it out  from quarter to quarter  and i will if any be left  carry it on  like an accomptant  to the next quarter and strike a balance four times a year  and a general balance at every year s end and i have written in it  humble returns for divine mercies  and locked it up safe in my newly presented cabinet i intend to let lady davers see no farther of my papers  than to her own angry letter to her brother  for i would not have her see my reflections upon it  and she ll know  down to that place  all that s necessary for her curiosity  as to my sufferings  and the stratagems used against me and the honest part i have been enabled to act  and i hope  when she has read them all  she will be quite reconciled  for she will see it is all god almighty s doings  and that a gentleman of his parts and knowledge was not to be drawn in by such a poor young body as me i will detain john no longer  he will tell you to read this last part first  and while he stays  and so  with my humble duty to you both  and my dear mr  b s kind remembrance  i rest                        your ever dutiful and gratefully happy daughter wednesday evening honoured father and mother i will now proceed with my journal on tuesday morning  my dear sir rode out  and brought with him to dinner  mr  martin of the grove  and mr  arthur  and mr  brooks  and one mr  chambers  and he stept up to me  and said he had rode out too far to return to breakfast  but he had brought with him some of his old acquaintance  to dine with me  are you sorry for it  pamela  said he  i remembered his lessons  and said no  sure  sir  i cannot be angry at any thing you are pleased to do  said he  you know mr  martin s character and have severely censured him in one of your letters  as one of my brother rakes  and for his three lyings in he then gave me the following account  how he came to bring them  said he  i met them all at mr  arthur s  and his lady asked me  if i was really married  i said  yes  really  and to whom  said mr  martin  why replied i  bluntly  to my mother s waiting maid  they could not tell what to say to me hereupon  and looked one upon another  and i saw i had spoiled a jest  from each  mrs  arthur said  you have  indeed  sir  a charming creature  as ever i saw  and she has mighty good luck  ay  said i  and so have i  but i shall say the less  because a man never did any thing of this nature  that he did not think he ought  if it were but in policy  to make the best of it  nay  said mr  arthur  if you have sinned  it is with your eyes open  for you know the world as well as any gentleman of your years in it why  really  gentlemen  said i  i should be glad to please all my friends  but i can t expect  till they know my motives and inducements that it will be so immediately  but i do assure you  i am exceedingly pleased myself  and that  you know  is most to the purpose said mr  brooks  i have heard my wife praise your spouse that is  so much for person and beauty  that i wanted to see her of all things  why replied i  if you ll all go and take a dinner with me  you shall see her with all my heart  and  mrs  arthur  will you bear us company  no indeed  sir  said she  what  i ll warrant  my wife will not be able to reconcile you to my mother s waiting maid  is not that it  tell truth mrs  arthur  nay  said she  i shan t be backward to pay your spouse a visit  in company of the neighbouring ladies  but for one single woman to go  on such a sudden motion too  with so many gentlemen  is not right  but that need not hinder you  gentlemen  so  said he  the rest sent  that they should not dine at home  and they and mr  chambers  a gentleman lately settled in these parts  one and all came with me  and so  my dear  concluded he  when you make your appearance next sunday you re sure of a party in your favour  for all that see you must esteem you he went to them  and when i came down to dinner  he was pleased to take me by the hand  at my entrance into the parlour  and said  my dear  i have brought some of my good neighbours to dine with you  i said  you are very good  sir my dear  this gentleman is mr  chambers  and so he presented every one to me  and they saluted me  and wished us both joy i  for my part  said mr  brooks  wish you joy most heartily  my wife told me a good deal of the beauties of your person  but i did not think we had such a flower in our country  sir  said i  your lady is very partial to me  and you are so polite a gentleman  that you will not contradict your good lady i ll assure you  madam  returned he  you have not hit the matter at all for we contradict one another twice or thrice a day  but the devil s in t if we are not agreed in so clear a case said mr  martin  mr  brooks says very true  madam  in both respects meaning his wife s and his own contradiction to one another  as well as in my favour  for  added he  they have been married some years as i had not the best opinion of this gentleman  nor his jest  i said i am almost sorry  sir  for the gentleman s jest upon himself and his lady  but i think it should have relieved him from a greater jest  your pleasant confirmation of it but still the reason you give that it may be so  i hope  is the reason that may be given that it is not so  to wit  that they have been married some years said mr  arthur  mr  martin  i think the lady has very handsomely reproved you  i think so too  said mr  chambers  and it was but a very indifferent compliment to a bride  said mr  martin  compliment or not gentlemen  i have never seen a matrimony of any time standing  that it was not so  little or much  but i dare say it will never be so here to be sure  sir  said i  if it was  i must be the ungratefullest person in the world  because i am the most obliged person in it  that notion said mr  arthur  is so excellent  that it gives a moral certainty it never can sir  said mr  brooks to my dear master  softly  you have a most accomplished lady  i do assure you  as well in her behaviour and wit as in her person  call her what you please  why  my dear friend  said my master  i must tell you  as i have said before now  that her person made me her lover  but her mind made her my wife the first course coming in  my dear sir led me himself to my place  and set mr  chambers  as the greatest stranger  at my right hand  and mr brooks at my left  and mr  arthur was pleased to observe  much to my advantage  on the ease and freedom with which i behaved myself  and helped them  and said  he would bring his lady to be a witness  and a learner both  of my manners  i said  i should be proud of any honour mrs  arthur would vouchsafe to do me  and if once i could promise myself the opportunity of his good lady s example  and those of the other gentlemen present  i should have the greater opinion of my worthiness to sit in the place i filled at present with much insufficiency mr  arthur drank to my health and happiness  and said  my wife told your spouse  madam  you had very good luck in such a husband  but i now see who has the best of it  said mr  brooks  come  come  let s make no compliments  for the plain truth of the matter is  our good neighbour s generosity and judgment have met with so equal a match in his lady s beauty and merit  that i know not which has the best luck  but may you be both long happy together  say i  and so he drank a glass of wine my best friend  who always takes delight to have me praised  seemed much pleased with our conversation  and he said the kindest  tenderest  and most respectful things in the world to me  insomuch  that the rough mr  martin said  did you ever think our good friend here  who used to ridicule matrimony so much  would have made so complaisant a husband how long do you intend  sir  that this shall hold  as long as my good girl deserves it  said he  and that  i hope  will be for ever  but continued the kind gentleman  you need not wonder i have changed my mind as to wedlock  for i never expected to meet with one whose behaviour and sweetness of temper were so well adapted to make me happy after dinner  and having drank good healths to each of their ladies  i withdrew  and they sat and drank two bottles of claret a piece  and were very merry  and went away  full of my praises  and vowing to bring their ladies to see me john having brought me your kind letter  my dear father  i told my good master  after his friends were gone  how gratefully you received his generous intentions as to the kentish farm  and promised your best endeavours to serve him in that estate  and that you hoped your industry and care would be so well employed in it  that you should be very little troublesome to him as to the liberal manner in which he had intended to add to a provision  that of itself exceeded all you wished  he was very well pleased with your cheerful acceptance of it i am glad your engagements in the world lie in so small a compass  as soon as you have gotten an account of them exactly  you will be pleased to send it me  with the list of the poor folks you are so kind to promise to procure me i think  as my dear master is so generous  you should account nothing that is plain  too good  pray don t be afraid of laying out upon yourselves  my dear sir intends that you shall not  when you come to us return to your old abode  but stay with us  till you set out for kent and so you must dispose of yourselves accordingly  and i hope  my dear father  you have quite left off all slavish business  as farmer jones has been kind to you  as i have heard you say  pray  when you take leave of them  present them with three guineas worth of good books  such as a family bible  a common prayer  a whole duty of man  or any other you think will be acceptable  for they live a great way from church  and in winter the ways from their farm thither are impassable he has brought me my papers safe  and i will send them to lady davers the first opportunity  down to the place i mentioned in my last my dear mr  b  just now tells me  that he will carry me  in the morning  a little airing  about ten miles off  in his chariot and four to breakfast at a farm house  noted for a fine dairy  and where  now and then  the neighbouring gentry  of both sexes  resort for that purpose thursday we set out at about half an hour after six  accordingly  and driving pretty smartly  got at this truly neat house at half an hour after eight  and i was much pleased with the neatness of the good woman  and her daughter and maid  and he was so good as to say he would now and then take a turn with me to the same place  and on the same occasion  as i seemed to like it  for that it would be a pretty exercise  and procure us appetites to our breakfasts  as well as our return would to our dinners  but i find this was not  though a very good reason  the only one for which he gave me this agreeable airing  as i shall acquaint you we were prettily received and entertained here  and an elegancy ran through every thing  persons as well as furniture  yet all plain  and my master said to the good housewife  do your young boarding school ladies still at times continue their visits to you  mrs  dobson  yes  sir  said she  i expect three or four of them every minute there is  my dear  said he  within three miles of this farm  a very good boarding school for ladies  the governess of it keeps a chaise and pair which is to be made a double chaise at pleasure  and in summer time when the misses perform their tasks to satisfaction  she favours them with an airing to this place  three or four at a time  and after they have breakfasted  they are carried back  and this serves both for a reward  and for exercise  and the misses who have this favour are not a little proud of it  and it brings them forward in their respective tasks a very good method  sir  said i  and just as we were talking  the chaise came in with four misses  all pretty much of a size  and a maid servant to attend them  they were shewn another little neat apartment  that went through ours  and made their honours very prettily  as they passed by us  i went into the room to them  and asked them questions about their work  and their lessons  and what they had done to deserve such a fine airing and breakfasting  and they all answered me very prettily  and pray  little ladies  said i  what may i call your names  one was called miss burdoff  one miss nugent  one miss booth  and the fourth miss goodwin  i don t know which  said i  is the prettiest  but you are all best  my little dears  and you have a very good governess  to indulge you with such a fine airing  and such delicate cream  and bread and butter  i hope you think so too my master came in  and i had no mistrust in the world  and he kissed each of them  but looked more wishfully on miss goodwin  than on any of the others  but i thought nothing just then  had she been called miss godfrey  i had hit upon it in a trice when we went from them  he said  which do you think the prettiest of those misses  really  sir  replied i  it is hard to say  miss booth is a pretty brown girl  and has a fine eye  miss burdoff has a great deal of sweetness in her countenance  but is not so regularly featured  miss nugent is very fair  and miss goodwin has a fine black eye  and is besides  i think  the genteelest shaped child  but they are all pretty the maid led them into the garden  to shew them the beehives  and miss goodwin made a particular fine courtesy to my master  and i said  i believe miss knows you  sir  and  taking her by the hand  i said  do you know this gentleman  my pretty dear yes  madam  said she  it is my own dear uncle  i clasped her in my arms  o why did you not tell me  sir said i  that you had a niece among these little ladies  and i kissed her  and away she tript after the others but pray  sir  said i  how can this be you have no sister nor brother but lady davers how can this be he smiled  and then i said  o my dearest sir  tell me now the truth does not this pretty miss stand in a nearer relation to you  than as a niece i know she does  i know she does  and i embraced him as he stood tis even so  my dear  replied he  and you remember my sister s good natured hint of miss sally godfrey  i do well  sir  answered i but this is miss goodwin  her mother chose that name for her  said he because she should not be called by her own well  said i  excuse me  sir  i must go and have a little prattle with her  i ll send for her in again  replied he  and in she came in a moment  i took her in my arms  and said  o my charming dear  will you love me will you let me be your aunt  yes  madam  answered she  with all my heart  and i will love you dearly  but i mustn t love my uncle why so  said he  because  replied she  you would not speak to me at first  and because you would not let me call you uncle for it seems she was bid not  that i might not guess at her presently  and yet  said the pretty dear  i had not seen you a great while  so i hadn t well  pamela  said he  now can you allow me to love this little innocent  allow you  sir  replied i  you would be very barbarous  if you did not  and i should be more so  if i did not further it all i could and love the little lamb myself  for your sake and for her own sake  and in compassion to her poor mother  though unknown to me  and tears stood in my eyes said he  why  my love  are your words so kind  and your countenance so sad i drew to the window from the child  and said  sad it is not  sir but i have a strange grief and pleasure mingled at once in my breast  on this occasion  it is indeed a twofold grief  and a twofold pleasure as how  my dear  said he  why  sir  replied i  i cannot help being grieved for the poor mother of this sweet babe  to think  if she be living  that she must call her chiefest delight her shame  if she be no more  that she must have had such remorse on her poor mind  when she came to leave the world  and her little babe  and  in the second place  i grieve  that it must be thought a kindness to the dear little soul  not to let her know how near the dearest relation she has in the world is to her forgive me  dear sir  i say not this to reproach you  in the least  indeed i don t  and i have a twofold cause of joy  first  that i have had the grace to escape the like unhappiness with this poor gentlewoman  and next  that this discovery has given me an opportunity to shew the sincerity of my grateful affection for you  sir  in the love i will always express to this dear child and then i stept to her again  and kissed her  and said  join with me my pretty love  to beg your dear uncle to let you come and live with your new aunt  indeed  my little precious  i ll love you dearly will you  sir  said the little charmer  will you let me go and live with my aunt you are very good  my pamela  said he  and i have not once been deceived in the hopes my fond heart has entertained of your prudence but will you  sir  said i  will you grant me this favour  i shall most sincerely love the little charmer  and all i am capable of doing for her  both by example and affection  shall most cordially be done  my dearest sir added i  oblige me in this thing  i think already my heart is set upon it  what a sweet employment and companionship shall i have we ll talk of this some other time  replied he  but i must  in prudence put some bounds to your amiable generosity  i had always intended to surprise you into this discovery  but my sister led the way to it  out of a poorness in her spite  that i could not brook  and though you have pleased me beyond expression  in your behaviour on this occasion  yet i can t say  that you have gone much beyond my expectations  for i have such a high opinion of you  that i think nothing could have shaken it  but a contrary conduct to this you have expressed on so tender a circumstance well  sir  said the dear little miss  then you will not let me go home with my aunt  will you  i am sure she will love me  when you break up next  my dear  said he  if you are a good girl  you shall pay your new aunt a visit  she made a low courtesy  thank you  sir  answered she yes  my dear  said i  and i will get you some fine things against the time  i would have brought you some now  had i known i should have seen my pretty love  thank you  madam  returned she how old  sir  said i  is miss  between six and seven  answered he  was she ever  sir  said i  at your house  my sister  replied he  carried her thither once  as a near relation of her lord s  i remember  sir  said i a little miss  and mrs  jervis and i took her to be a relation of lord davers my sister  returned he  knew the whole secret from the beginning  and it made her a great merit with me  that she kept it from the knowledge of my father  who was then living  and of my mother  to her dying day though she descended so low in her rage  to hint the matter to you the little misses took their leaves soon after  and i know not how  but i am strangely affected with this dear child  i wish he would be so good as to let me have her home  it would be a great pleasure to have such a fine opportunity  obliged as i am  to shew my love for himself  in my fondness for his dear miss as we came home together in the chariot  he gave me the following particulars of this affair  additional to what he had before mentioned that this lady was of a good family  and the flower of it but that her mother was a person of great art and address  and not altogether so nice in the particular between himself and miss  as she ought to have been that  particularly  when she had reason to find him unsettled and wild and her daughter in more danger from him  than he was from her  yet she encouraged their privacies  and even  at last  when she had reason to apprehend  from their being surprised together  in a way not so creditable to the lady  that she was far from forbidding their private meetings  on the contrary  that  on a certain time  she had set one that had formerly been her footman  and a half pay officer  her relation  to watch an opportunity  and to frighten him into a marriage with the lady that  accordingly  when they had surprised him in her chamber  just as he had been let in  they drew their swords upon him  and threatened instantly to kill him  if he did not promise marriage on the spot  and that they had a parson ready below stairs  as he found afterwards  that then he suspected  from some strong circumstances  that miss was in the plot  which so enraged him  with their menaces together  that he drew and stood upon his defence  and was so much in earnest  that the man he pushed into the arm  and disabled  and pressing pretty forward upon the other  as he retreated  he rushed in upon him near the top of the stairs  and pushed him down one pair  and he was much hurt by the fall not but that  he said  he might have paid for his rashness  but that the business of his antagonists was rather to frighten than to kill him  that  upon this  in the sight of the old lady  the parson she had provided  and her other daughters  he went out of their house  with bitter execrations against them all that after this  designing to break off all correspondence with the whole family  and miss too  she found means to engage him to give her a meeting at woodstock  in order to clear herself  that  poor lady  she was there obliged  naughty creature as he was  to make herself quite guilty of a worse fault  in order to clear herself of a lighter that they afterwards met at godstow often  at woodstock  and every neighbouring place to oxford  where he was then studying  as it proved guilty lessons  instead of improving ones  till  at last  the effect of their frequent interviews grew too obvious to be concealed  that the young lady then  when she was not fit to be seen  for the credit of the family  was confined  and all manner of means were used  to induce him to marry her  that  finding nothing would do  they at last resolved to complain to his father and mother  but that he made his sister acquainted with the matter  who then happened to be at home  and  by her management and spirit  their intentions of that sort were frustrated and  seeing no hopes  they agreed to lady davers s proposals  and sent poor miss down to marlborough  where  at her expense  which he answered to her again  she was provided for  and privately lay in  that lady davers took upon herself the care of the little one  till it came to be fit to be put to the boarding school  where it now is  and that he had settled upon the dear little miss such a sum of money  as the interest of it would handsomely provide for her  and the principal would be a tolerable fortune  fit for a gentlewoman  when she came to be marriageable  and this  my dear  said he  is the story in brief  and i do assure you  pamela  added he  i am far from making a boast of  or taking a pride in  this affair  but since it has happened  i can t say but i wish the poor child to live  and be happy  and i must endeavour to make her so sir  said i  to be sure you should  and i shall take a very great pride to contribute to the dear little soul s felicity  if you will permit me to have her home but  added i  does miss know any thing who are her father and mother  i wanted him to say if the poor lady was living or dead no  answered he  her governess has been told  by my sister  that she is the daughter of a gentleman and his lady  who are related  at a distance  to lord davers  and now live in jamaica  and she calls me uncle  only because i am the brother to lady davers  whom she calls aunt  and who is very fond of her  as is also my lord  who knows the whole matter  and they have her  at all her little school recesses  at their house  and are very kind to her i believe  added he  the truth of the matter is very little known or suspected  for  as her mother is of no mean family  her friends endeavour to keep it secret  as much as i  and lady davers  till her wrath boiled over  t other day  has managed the matter very dexterously and kindly the words  mother is of no mean family  gave me not to doubt the poor lady was living  and i said  but how  sir  can the dear miss s poor mother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child ah  pamela  replied he  now you come in  i see you want to know what s become of the poor mother  tis natural enough you should  but i was willing to see how the little suspense would operate upon you dear sir  said i nay  replied he  tis very natural  my dear  i think you have had a great deal of patience  and are come at this question so fairly that you deserve to be answered you must know then  there is some foundation for saying  that her mother  at least  lives in jamaica  for there she does live  and very happily too  for i must observe  that she suffered so much in child bed that nobody expected her life  and this  when she was up  made such an impression upon her  that she dreaded nothing so much as the thoughts of returning to her former fault  and  to say the truth  i had intended to make her a visit as soon as her month was well up  and so  unknown to me  she engaged herself to go to jamaica  with two young ladies  who were born there  and were returning to their friends  after they had been four years in england for their education  and  recommending to me by a very moving letter  her little baby  and that i would not suffer it to be called by her name  but goodwin  that her shame might be the less known  for hers and her family s sake  she got her friends to assign her five hundred pounds  in full of all her demands upon her family  and went up to london  and embarked  with her companions  at gravesend and so sailed to jamaica  where she is since well and happily married passing to her husband for a young widow  with one daughter  which her husband s friends take care of  and provide for  and so you see  pamela that in the whole story on both sides  the truth is as much preserved as possible poor lady  said i  how her story moves me  i am glad she is so happy at last and  my dear  said he  are you not glad she is so far off too as to that  sir  said i  i cannot be sorry  to be sure  as she is so happy  which she could not have been here  for  sir  i doubt you would have proceeded with your temptations  if she had not gone  and it shewed she was much in earnest to be good  that she could leave her native country  leave all her relations  leave you  whom she so well loved  leave her dear baby  and try a new fortune  in a new world  among quite strangers  and hazard the seas  and all to preserve herself from further guiltiness  indeed  indeed  sir  said i  i bleed for what her distresses must be  in this case i am grieved for her poor mind s remorse  through her childbed terrors  which could have so great and so worthy an effect upon her afterwards  and i honour her resolution  and would rank such a returning dear lady in the class of those who are most virtuous  and doubt not god almighty s mercy to her  and that her present happiness is the result of his gracious providence  blessing her penitence and reformation but  sir  said i  did you not once see the poor lady after her lying in i did not believe her so much in earnest  answered he  and i went down to marlborough  and heard she was gone from thence to calne  i went to calne  and heard she was gone to reading  to a relation s there  thither i went  and heard she was gone to oxford  i followed  and there she was but i could not see her she at last received a letter from me  begging a meeting with her  for i found her departure with the ladies was resolved on  and that she was with her friends  only to take leave of them  and receive her agreed on portion  and she appointed the saturday following  and that was wednesday  to give me a meeting at the old place  at woodstock then  added he  i thought i was sure of her  and doubted not i should spoil her intended voyage  i set out on thursday to gloucester  on a party of pleasure  and on saturday i went to the place appointed  at woodstock  but when i came thither  i found a letter instead of my lady  and when i opened it  it was to beg my pardon for deceiving me expressing her concern for her past fault  her affection for me  and the apprehension she had  that she should be unable to keep her good resolves  if she met me  that she had set out on the thursday for her embarkation  for that she feared nothing else could save her  and had appointed this meeting on saturday  at the place of her former guilt that i might be suitably impressed upon the occasion  and pity and allow for her  and that she might get three or four days start of me  and be quite out of my reach  she recommended again  as upon the spot where the poor little one owed its being  my tenderness to it  for her sake  and that was all she had to request of me  she said  but would not forget to pray for me in all her own dangers  and in every difficulty she was going to encounter i wept at this moving tale  and did not this make a deep impression upon you  sir  said i  surely such an affecting lesson as this  on the very guilty spot too  i admire the dear lady s pious contrivance  must have had a great effect upon you  one would have thought  sir  it was enough to reclaim you for ever  all your naughty purposes  i make no doubt were quite changed why  my dear  said he  i was much moved  you may be sure  when i came to reflect  but  at first  i was so assured of being a successful tempter and spoiling her voyage  that i was vexed  and much out of humour but when i came to reflect  as i said  i was quite overcome with this instance of her prudence  her penitence  and her resolution  and more admired her than i ever had done  yet i could not bear she should so escape me neither  so much overcome me  as it were  in an heroical bravery  and i hastened away  and got a bill of credit of lord davers upon his banker in london  for five hundred pounds  and set out for that place  having called at oxford  and got what light i could  as to where i might hear of her there when i arrived in town  which was not till monday morning  i went to a place called crosby square  where the friends of the two ladies lived she had set out in the flying coach on tuesday  got to the two ladies that very night  and  on saturday  had set out with them for gravesend much about the time i was expecting her at woodstock you may suppose that i was much affected  my dear  with this  however i got my bill of credit converted into money  and i set out with my servant on monday afternoon  and reached gravesend that night  and there i understood that she and the two ladies had gone on board from the very inn i put up at  in the morning  and the ship waited only for the wind which then was turning about in its favour i got a boat directly  and went on board the ship  and asked for mrs godfrey  but judge you  my dear pamela  her surprise and confusion  when she saw me  she had like to have fainted away  i offered any money to put off the sailing till next day  but it would not be complied with and fain would i have got her on shore  and promised to attend her  if she would go over land  to any part of england the ship would touch at but she was immovable every one concluded me her humble servant  and were touched at the moving interview  the young ladies  and their female attendants especially  with great difficulty  upon my solemn assurances of honour she trusted herself with me in one of the cabins  and there i tried what i could  to prevail upon her to quit her purpose  but all in vain  she said  i had made her quite unhappy by this interview  she had difficulties enough upon her mind before  but now i had embittered all her voyage  and given her the deepest distress i could prevail upon her but for one favour  and that with the greatest reluctance  which was  to accept of the five hundred pounds  as a present from me  and she promised  at my earnest desire  to draw upon me for a greater sum  as a person that had her effects in my hands  when she arrived  if she should find it convenient for her  in short  this was all the favour i could procure  for she would not promise so much as to correspond with me  and was determined on going  and  i believe  if i would have married her  which yet i had not in my head  she would not have deviated from her purpose but how  sir  said i  did you part  i would have sailed with her answered he  and been landed at the first port in england or ireland i cared not which  they should put in at  but she was too full of apprehensions to admit it  and the rough fellow of a master  captain they called him  but  in my mind  i could have thrown him overboard would not stay a moment  the wind and tide being quite fair  and was very urgent with me to go a shore  or to go the voyage  and being impetuous in my temper  spoiled  you know  my dear  by my mother  and not used to control  i thought it very strange that wind or tide  or any thing else  should be preferred to me and my money  but so it was  i was forced to go  and so took leave of the ladies  and the other passengers wished them a good voyage  gave five guineas among the ship s crew  to be good to the ladies  and took such a leave as you may better imagine than i express  she recommended once more to me  the dear guest  as she called her  the ladies being present  and thanked me for all these instances of my regard  which  she said  would leave a strong impression on her mind  and  at parting  she threw her arms about my neck  and we took such a leave  as affected every one present  men  as well as ladies so  with a truly heavy heart  i went down the ship s side to my boat and stood up in it  looking at her  as long as i could see her  and she at me  with her handkerchief at her eyes  and then i gazed at the ship till  and after i had landed  as long as i could discern the least appearance of it  for she was under sail  in a manner  when i left her and so i returned highly disturbed to my inn i went to bed  but rested not  returned to london the next morning  and set out that afternoon again for the country  and so much  my dear  for poor sally godfrey she sends  i understand  by all opportunities with the knowledge of her husband  to learn how her child  by her first husband  does  and has the satisfaction to know she is happily provided for  and  about half a year ago  her spouse sent a little negro boy  of about ten years old  as a present  to wait upon her  but he was taken ill of the small pox  and died in a month after he was landed sure  sir  said i  your generous mind must have been long affected with this melancholy case  and all its circumstances it hung upon me  indeed  some time  said he  but i was full of spirit and inconsideration  i went soon after to travel  a hundred new objects danced before my eyes  and kept reflection from me  and  you see  i had five or six years afterwards  and even before that  so thoroughly lost all the impressions you talk of  that i doubted not to make my pamela change her name  without either act of parliament  or wedlock  and be sally godfrey the second o you dear naughty man  said i  this seems but too true  but i bless god that it is not so i bless god for your reformation  and that for your own dear sake  as well as mine well  my dear  said he  and i bless god for it too i do most sincerely and tis my greater pleasure  because i have  as i hoped seen my error so early  and that with such a stock of youth and health on my side  in all appearance  i can truly abhor my past liberties  and pity poor sally godfrey  from the same motives that i admire my pamela s virtues  and resolve to make myself as worthy of them as possible  and i will hope  my dear  your prayers for my pardon  and my perseverance will be of no small efficacy on this occasion these agreeable reflections  on this melancholy but instructive story brought us in view of his own house  and we alighted  and took a walk in the garden till dinner was ready  and now we are so busy about making ready for our appearance  that i shall hardly have time to write till that be over monday morning yesterday we set out  attended by john  abraham  benjamin  and isaac  in fine new liveries  in the best chariot  which had been new cleaned  and lined  and new harnessed  so that it looked like a quite new one  but i had no arms to quarter with my dear lord and master s  though he jocularly  upon my taking notice of my obscurity  said  that he had a good mind to have the olive branch  which would allude to his hopes quartered for mine  i was dressed in the suit i mentioned  of white flowered with silver  and a rich head dress  and the diamond necklace ear rings  etc  i also mentioned before  and my dear sir  in a fine laced silk waistcoat  of blue paduasoy  and his coat a pearl coloured fine cloth  with gold buttons and button holes  and lined with white silk  and he looked charmingly indeed  i said  i was too fine  and would have laid aside some of the jewels  but he said  it would be thought a slight to me from him  as his wife  and though as i apprehended it might be  that people would talk as it was  yet he had rather they should say any thing  than that i was not put upon an equal footing  as his wife  with any lady he might have married it seems the neighbouring gentry had expected us  and there was a great congregation  for against my wish  we were a little of the latest  so that  as we walked up the church to his seat  we had abundance of gazers and whisperers  but my dear master behaved with so intrepid an air  and was so cheerful and complaisant to me  that he did credit to his kind choice  instead of shewing as if he was ashamed of it  and as i was resolved to busy my mind entirely with the duties of the day  my intentness on that occasion  and my thankfulness to god  for his unspeakable mercies to me  so took up my thoughts  that i was much less concerned  than i should otherwise have been  at the gazings and whisperings of the ladies and gentlemen  as well as of the rest of the congregation  whose eyes were all turned to our seat when the sermon was ended  we staid the longer  because the church should be pretty empty  but we found great numbers at the church doors and in the church porch  and i had the pleasure of hearing many commendations  as well of my person  as my dress and behaviour  and not one reflection  or mark of disrespect  mr  martin  who is single  mr chambers  mr  arthur  and mr  brooks  with their families  were all there  and the four gentlemen came up to us  before we went into the chariot  and  in a very kind and respectful manner  complimented us both  and mrs  arthur and mrs  brooks were so kind as to wish me joy and mrs  brooks said  you sent mr  brooks  madam  home t other day quite charmed with a manner  which  you have convinced a thousand persons this day  is natural to you you do me great honour  madam  replied i  such a good lady s approbation must make me too sensible of my happiness  my dear master handed me into the chariot  and stood talking with sir thomas atkyns  at the door of it  who was making him abundance of compliments  and is a very ceremonious gentleman  a little too extreme in that way  and  i believe  to familiarize me to the gazers  which concerned me a little for i was dashed to hear the praises of the countrypeople  and to see how they crowded about the chariot  several poor people begged my charity  and i beckoned john with my fan  and said  divide in the further church porch  that money to the poor  and let them come to morrow morning to me  and i will give them something more  if they don t importune me now  so i gave him all the silver i had  which happened to be between twenty and thirty shillings  and this drew away from me their clamorous prayers for charity mr  martin came up to me on the other side of the chariot  and leaned on the very door  while my master was talking to sir thomas  from whom he could not get away  and said  by all that s good  you have charmed the whole congregation  not a soul but is full of your praises  my neighbour knew  better than any body could tell him  how to choose for himself why  said he  the dean himself looked more upon you than his book o sir  said i  you are very encouraging to a weak mind  i vow  said he  i say no more than is truth  i d marry to morrow  if i was sure of meeting with a person of but one half the merit you have  you are continued he  and tis not my way to praise too much  an ornament to your sex  an honour to your spouse  and a credit to religion every body is saying so  added he  for you have  by your piety  edified the whole church as he had done speaking  the dean himself complimented me  that the behaviour of so worthy a lady  would be very edifying to his congregation  and encouraging to himself  sir  said i  you are very kind  i hope i shall not behave unworthy of the good instructions i shall have the pleasure to receive from so worthy a divine  he bowed and went on sir thomas then applied to me  my master stepping into the chariot  and said  i beg pardon  madam  for detaining your good spouse from you  but i have been saying  he is the happiest man in the world  i bowed to him but i could have wished him further  to make me sit so in the notice of every one  which  for all i could do  dashed me not a little  mr  martin said to my master  if you ll come to church every sunday with your charming lady  i will never absent myself  and she ll give a good example to all the neighbourhood  o  my dear sir  said i to my master you know not how much i am obliged to good mr  martin  he has  by his kind expressions  made me dare to look up with pleasure and gratitude said my master  my dear love  i am very much obliged  as well as you  to my good friend mr  martin  and he said to him  we will constantly go to church  and to every other place  where we can have the pleasure of seeing mr  martin mr  martin said  gad  sir  you are a happy man  and i think your lady s example has made you more polite and handsome too  than i ever knew you before  though we never thought you unpolite  neither  and so he bowed and went to his own chariot  and  as we drove away  the people kindly blessed us  and called us a charming pair as i have no other pride  i hope  in repeating these things  than in the countenance the general approbation gives to my dear master  for his stooping so low  you will excuse me for it  i know in the afternoon we went again to church  and a little early  at my request  but the church was quite full  and soon after even crowded  so much does novelty the more s the pity  attract the eyes of mankind mr  martin came in after us  and made up to our seat  and said  if you please  my dear friend  i will take my seat with you this afternoon with all my heart  said my master  i was sorry for it  but was resolved my duty should not be made second to bashfulness  or any other consideration  and when divine service began  i withdrew to the farther end of the pew  and left the gentlemen in the front  and they behaved quite suitably  both of them  to the occasion  i mention this the rather  because mr  martin was not very noted for coming to church  or attention when there  before the dean preached again  which he was not used to do  out of compliment to us  and an excellent sermon he made on the relative duties of christianity  and it took my particular attention  for he made many fine observations on the subject  mr  martin addressed himself twice or thrice to me  during the sermon  but he saw me so wholly engrossed with hearkening to the good preacher  that he forbore interrupting me  yet i took care  according to the lessons formerly given me  to observe to him a cheerful and obliging behaviour  as one of mr  b s friends and intimates  my master asked him to give him his company to supper  and he said  i am so taken with your lady  that you must not give me too much encouragement  for i shall be always with you  if you do  he was pleased to say  you cannot favour us with too much of your company  and as i have left you in the lurch in your single state  i think you will do well to oblige us as much as you can  and who knows but my happiness may reform another rake  who knows  said mr  martin  why  i know  for i am more than half reformed already at the chariot door  mrs  arthur  mrs  brooks  and mrs  chambers  were brought to me  by their respective spouses  and presently the witty lady towers  who bantered me before  as i once told you  joined them  and mrs  arthur said  she wished me joy  and that all the good ladies  my neighbours  would collect themselves together  and make me a visit this  said i  will be an honour  madam  that i can never enough acknowledge  it will be very kind so to countenance a person who will always study to deserve your favour  by the most respectful behaviour lady towers said  my dear neighbour  you want no countenance  your own merit is sufficient  i had a slight cold  that kept me at home in the morning  but i heard you so much talked of  and praised  that i resolved not to stay away in the afternoon  and i join in the joy every one gives you  she turned to my master  and said  you are a sly thief  as i always thought you  where have you stolen this lady  and now  how barbarous is it  thus unawares  in a manner  to bring her here upon us  to mortify and eclipse us all you are very kind  madam  said he  that you and all my worthy neighbours see with my eyes  but had i not known she had so much excellency of mind and behaviour  as would strike every body in her favour at first sight  i should not have dared to class her with such of my worthy neighbours  as now so kindly congratulate us both i own  said she  softly  i was one of your censurers  but i never liked you so well in my life  as for this action  now i see how capable your bride is of giving distinction to any condition and  coming to me  my dear neighbour  said she  excuse me for having but in my thought  the remembrance that i have seen you formerly  when  by your sweet air and easy deportment  you so much surpass us all  and give credit to your present happy condition dear good madam  said i  how shall i suitably return my acknowledgments but it will never be a pain to me to look back upon my former days now i have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy ladies to support me in the honours to which the most generous of men has raised me sweetly said  she was pleased to say  if i was in another place  i would kiss you for that answer  oh  happy  happy mr  b  said she to my master  what reputation have you not brought upon your judgment  i won t be long before i see you  added she  i ll assure you  if i come by myself  that shall be your own fault  madam  said mrs  brooks and so they took leave  and i gave my hand to my dear master  and said how happy have you made me  generous sir and the dean  who had just come up  heard me  and said  and how happy you have made your spouse i ll venture to pronounce  is hard to say  from what i observe of you both  i courtesied  and blushed  not thinking any body heard me  and my master telling him he should be glad of the honour of a visit from him he said  he would pay his respects to us the first opportunity  and bring his wife and daughter to attend me  i said  that was doubly kind and i should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an acquaintance  i thanked him for his kind discourse  and he thanked me for my attention which he called exemplary  and so my dear master handed me into the chariot  and we were carried home  both happy  and both pleased  thank god mr  martin came in the evening  with another gentleman  his friend  one mr  dormer  and he entertained us with the favourable opinion  he said every one had of me  and of the choice my good benefactor had made this morning the poor came  according to my invitation  and i sent them away with glad hearts to the number of twenty five  there were not above twelve or fourteen on sunday  that john divided the silver among  which i gave him for that purpose  but others got hold of the matter  and made up to the above number tuesday my generous master has given me  this morning  a most considerate  but yet  from the nature of it  melancholy instance of his great regard for my unworthiness  which i never could have wished  hoped for  or even thought of he took a walk with me  after breakfast  into the garden  and a little shower falling  he led me  for shelter  into the little summer house in the private garden  where he formerly gave me apprehensions  and sitting down by me  he said  i have now finished all that lies on my mind  my dear  and am very easy  for have you not wondered  that i have so much employed myself in my library  been so much at home  and yet not in your company no  sir  said i  i have never been so impertinent as to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about  nor would give way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you  and  besides i know your large possessions  and the method you take of looking yourself into your affairs  must needs take up so much of your time that i ought to be very careful how i intrude upon you well  said he  but i ll tell you what has been my last work i have taken it into my consideration  that  at present  my line is almost extinct and that the chief part of my maternal estate  in case i die without issue  will go to another line  and great part of my personal will fall into such hands  as i shall not care my pamela should be at the mercy of  i have  therefore  as human life is uncertain  made such a disposition of my affairs  as will make you absolutely independent and happy  as will secure to you the power of doing a great deal of good and living as a person ought to do  who is my relict  and shall put it out of any body s power to molest your father and mother  in the provision i design them  for the remainder of their days  and i have finished all this very morning  except to naming trustees for you  and if you have any body you would confide in more than another  i would have you speak i was so touched with this mournful instance of his excessive goodness to me  and the thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn occasion that i was unable to speak  and at last relieved my mind by a violent fit of weeping  and could only say  clasping my arms around the dear generous man  how shall i support this  so very cruel  yet so very kind don t  my dear  said he  be concerned at what gives me pleasure  i am not the nearer my end  for having made this disposition  but i think the putting off these material points  when so many accidents every day happen  and life is so precarious  is one of the most inexcusable things in the world  and there are many important points to be thought of  when life is drawing to its utmost verge  and the mind may be so agitated and unfit  that it is a most sad thing to put off  to that time  any of those concerns  which more especially require a considerate and composed frame of temper  and perfect health and vigour  to give directions about  my poor friend  mr  carlton  who died in my arms so lately  and had a mind disturbed by worldly considerations on one side  a weakness of body  through the violence of his distemper  on another  and the concerns of still as much more moment  as the soul is to the body  on a third  made so great an impression upon me then  that i was the more impatient to come to this house  where were most of my writings  in order to make the disposition i have now perfected  and since it is grievous to my dear girl  i will myself think of such trustees as shall be most for her benefit  i have only  therefore  to assure you  my dear that in this instance  as i will do in any other i can think of  i have studied to make you quite easy  free  and independent  and because i shall avoid all occasions  for the future  which may discompose you  i have but one request to make  which is  that if it please god  for my sins  to separate me from my dearest pamela  you will only resolve not to marry one person  for i would not be such a herod  as to restrain you from a change of condition with any other  however reluctantly i may think of any other person s succeeding me in your esteem i could not answer  and thought my heart would have burst  and he continued  to conclude at once a subject that is so grievous to you  i will tell you  my pamela  that this person is mr  williams  and now i will acquaint you with my motive for this request  which is wholly owing to my niceness  and to no dislike i have for him  or apprehension of any likelihood that it will be so  but  methinks it would reflect a little upon my pamela  if she was to give way to such a conduct  as if she had married a man for his estate  when she had rather have had another had it not been for that  and that now  the world will say  she is at liberty to pursue her inclination  the parson is the man and i cannot bear even the most distant apprehension  that i had not the preference with you  of any man living  let me have been what i would  as i have shewn my dear life  that i have preferred her to all her sex  of whatever degree i could not speak  might i have had the world  and he took me in his arms  and said  i have now spoken all my mind  and expect no answer  and i see you too much moved to give me one  only forgive me the mention since i have told you my motive  which as much affects your reputation as my niceness  and offer not at an answer only say  you forgive me and i hope i have not one discomposing thing to say to my dearest  for the rest of my life  which i pray god  for both our sakes  to lengthen for many happy years grief still choaked up the passage of my words  and he said  the shower is over  my dear  let us walk out again he led me out  and i would have spoken  but he said  i will not hear my dear creature say any thing  to hearken to your assurance of complying with my request  would look as if i doubted you  and wanted it  i am confident i needed only to speak my mind  to be observed by you  and i shall never more think on the subject  if you don t remind me of it  he then most sweetly changed the discourse don t you with pleasure  my dear  said he  take in the delightful fragrance that this sweet shower has given to these banks of flowers your presence is so enlivening to me  that i could almost fancy  that what we owe to the shower  is owing to that  and all nature  methinks blooms around me when i have my pamela by my side  you are a poetess my dear  and i will give you a few lines  that i made myself on such an occasion as this i am speaking of  the presence of a sweet companion and the fresh verdure  that  after a shower  succeeding a long drought shewed itself throughout all vegetable nature  and then  in a sweet and easy accent  with his dear arms about me as we walked  he sung me the following verses  of which he afterwards favoured me with a copy                   i     all nature blooms when you appear     the fields their richest liv ries wear     oaks  elms  and pines  blest with your view     shoot out fresh greens  and bud anew       the varying seasons you supply       and  when you re gone  they fade and die                  ii     sweet philomel  in mournful strains     to you appeals  to you complains     the tow ring lark  on rising wing     warbles to you  your praise does sing       he cuts the yielding air  and flies       to heav n  to type your future joys                 iii     the purple violet  damask rose     each  to delight your senses  blows     the lilies ope  as you appear     and all the beauties of the year       diffuse their odours at your feet       who give to ev ry flow r its sweet                  iv     for flow rs and women are allied     both  nature s glory  and her pride     of ev ry fragrant sweet possest     they bloom but for the fair one s breast       and to the swelling bosom borne       each other mutually adorn thus sweetly did he palliate the woes  which the generosity of his actions  mixed with the solemness of the occasion  and the strange request he had vouchsafed to make me  had occasioned  and all he would permit me to say  was  that i was not displeased with him displeased with you  dearest sir  said i  let me thus testify my obligations  and the force all your commands shall have upon me  and i took the liberty to clasp my arms about his neck  and kissed him but yet my mind was pained at times  and has been to this hour god grant that i may never see the dreadful moment  that shall shut up the precious life of this excellent  generous benefactor of mine  and but i cannot bear to suppose i cannot say more on such a deep subject oh  what a poor thing is human life in its best enjoyments  subjected to imaginary evils  when it has no real ones to disturb it  and that can be made as effectually unhappy by its apprehensions of remote contingencies  as if it was struggling with the pangs of a present distress  this  duly reflected upon  methinks  should convince every one  that this world is not a place for the immortal mind to be confined to  and that there must be an hereafter  where the whole soul shall be satisfied but i shall get out of my depth  my shallow mind cannot comprehend as it ought  these weighty subjects  let me only therefore pray  that after having made a grateful use of god s mercies here  i may  with my dear benefactor  rejoice in that happy state  where is no mixture no unsatisfiedness  and where all is joy  and peace  and love  for evermore i said  when we sat at supper  the charming taste you gave me  sir  of your poetical fancy  makes me sure you have more favours of this kind to delight me with  if you please  and may i beg to be indulged on this agreeable head  hitherto  said he  my life has been too much a life of gayety and action  to be busied so innocently  some little essays i have now and then attempted  but very few have i completed  indeed i had not patience nor attention enough to hold me long to any one thing  now and then  perhaps  i may occasionally shew you what i have essayed  but i never could please myself in this way friday we were yesterday favoured with the company of almost all the neighbouring gentlemen and their ladies  who  by appointment with one another  met to congratulate our happiness  nothing could be more obliging  more free and affectionate  than the ladies  nothing more polite than the gentlemen  all was performed for they came to supper with decency and order  and much to every one s satisfaction  which was principally owing to good mrs  jervis s care and skill  who is an excellent manager for my part  i was dressed out only to be admired  as it seems  and truly  if i had not known  that i did not make myself  as you  my dear father  once hinted to me  and if i had had the vanity to think as well of myself  as the good company was pleased to do  i might possibly have been proud  but i know  as my lady davers said  though in anger  yet in truth  that i am but a poor bit of painted dirt  all that i value myself upon  is  that god has raised me to a condition to be useful  in my generation  to better persons than myself  this is my pride  and i hope this will be all my pride  for what was i of myself all the good i can do  is but a poor third hand good  for my dearest master himself is but the second hand  god  the all gracious  the all good  the all bountiful the all mighty  the all merciful god  is the first  to him  therefore be all the glory as i expect the happiness  the unspeakable happiness  my ever dear and ever honoured father and mother  of enjoying you both here  under this roof  so soon  and pray let it be as soon as you can  i will not enter into the particulars of the last agreeable evening  for i shall have a thousand things  as well as that  to talk to you upon  i fear you will be tired with my prattle when i see you i am to return these visits singly  and there were eight ladies here of different families  dear heart  i shall find enough to do i doubt my time will not be so well filled up  as i once promised my dear master but he is pleased  cheerful  kind  affectionate  o what a happy creature am i may i be always thankful to god  and grateful to him when all these tumultuous visitings are over  i shall have my mind  i hope  subside into a family calm  that i may make myself a little useful to the household of my dear master  or else i shall be an unprofitable servant indeed lady davers sent this morning her compliments to us both  very affectionately  and her lord s good wishes and congratulations  and she desired my writings per bearer  and says  she will herself bring them to me again  with thanks  as soon as she has read them  and she and her lord will come and be my guests that was her particularly kind word for a fortnight i have now but one thing to wish for  and then  methinks  i shall be all ecstasy  and that is  your presence  both of you  and your blessings which i hope you will bestow upon me every morning and night  till you are settled in the happy manner my dear mr  b  has intended methinks i want sadly your list of the honest and worthy poor  for the money lies by me  and brings me no interest  you see i am become a mere usurer  and want to make use upon use  and yet  when i have done all  i cannot do so much as i ought  god forgive my imperfections i tell my dear spouse  i want another dairy house visit  to be sure  if he won t  at present  permit it  i shall  if it please god to spare us tease him like any over indulged wife  if  as the dear charmer grows older  he won t let me have the pleasure of forming her tender mind  as well as i am able  lest  poor little soul  she fall into such snares as her unhappy dear mother fell into  i am providing a power of pretty things for her  against i see her next  that i may make her love me  if i can just now i have the blessed news  that you will set out for this happy house on tuesday morning  the chariot shall be with you without fail god give us a happy meeting  o how i long for it  forgive your impatient daughter  who sends this to amuse you on your journey  and desires to be ever most dutifully yours here end  at present  the letters of pamela to her father and mother they arrived at their daughter s house on tuesday evening in the following week  and were received by her with the utmost joy and duty and with great goodness and complaisance by mr  b  and having resided there till every thing was put in order for them at the kentish estate  they were carried down thither by himself  and their daughter and put into possession of the pretty farm he had designed for them the reader will here indulge us in a few brief observations  which naturally result from the story and characters  and which will serve as so many applications of its most material incidents to the minds of youth of both sexes first  then  in the character of the gentleman  may be seen that of a fashionable libertine  who allowed himself in the free indulgence of his passions  especially to the fair sex  and found himself supported in his daring attempts  by an affluent fortune in possession  a personal bravery  as it is called  readier to give than take offence  and an imperious will  yet as he betimes sees his errors  and reforms in the bloom of youth  an edifying lesson may be drawn from it  for the use of such as are born to large fortunes  and who may be taught  by his example  the inexpressible difference between the hazards and remorse which attend a profligate course of life  and the pleasures which flow from virtuous love  and benevolent actions in the character of lady davers  let the proud  and the high born  see the deformity of unreasonable passion  and how weak and ridiculous such persons must appear  who suffer themselves  as is usually the case  to be hurried from the height of violence  to the most abject submission and subject themselves to be outdone by the humble virtue they so much despise let good clergymen  in mr  williams  see  that whatever displeasure the doing of their duty may give  for a time  to their proud patrons providence will  at last  reward their piety  and turn their distresses to triumph  and make them even more valued for a conduct that gave offence while the violence of passion lasted  than if they had meanly stooped to flatter or soothe the vices of the great in the examples of good old andrews and his wife  let those  who are reduced to a low estate  see  that providence never fails to reward their honesty and integrity  and that god will  in his own good time extricate them  by means unforeseen  out of their present difficulties and reward them with benefits unhoped for the upper servants of great families may  from the odious character of mrs  jewkes  and the amiable ones of mrs  jervis  mr  longman  etc learn what to avoid  and what to choose  to make themselves valued and esteemed by all who know them and  from the double conduct of poor john  the lower servants may learn fidelity  and how to distinguish between the lawful and unlawful commands of a superior the poor deluded female  who  like the once unhappy miss godfrey  has given up her honour  and yielded to the allurements of her designing lover  may learn from her story  to stop at the first fault  and  by resolving to repent and amend  see the pardon and blessing which await her penitence  and a kind providence ready to extend the arms of its mercy to receive and reward her returning duty  while the prostitute pursuing the wicked courses  into which  perhaps  she was at first inadvertently drawn  hurries herself into filthy diseases  and an untimely death  and  too probably  into everlasting perdition let the desponding heart be comforted by the happy issue which the troubles and trials of pamela met with  when they see  in her case that no danger nor distress  however inevitable  or deep to their apprehensions  can be out of the power of providence to obviate or relieve  and which  as in various instances in her story  can turn the most seemingly grievous things to its own glory  and the reward of suffering innocence  and that too  at a time when all human prospects seem to fail let the rich  and those who are exalted from a low to a high estate learn from her  that they are not promoted only for a single good  but that providence has raised them  that they should dispense to all within their reach  the blessings it has heaped upon them  and that the greater the power is to which god hath raised them  the greater is the good that will be expected from them from the low opinion she every where shews of herself  and her attributing all her excellencies to pious education  and her lady s virtuous instructions and bounty  let persons  even of genius and piety learn not to arrogate to themselves those gifts and graces  which they owe least of all to themselves  since the beauties of person are frail and it is not in our power to give them to ourselves  or to be either prudent  wise  or good  without the assistance of divine grace from the same good example  let children see what a blessing awaits their duty to their parents  though ever so low in the world  and that the only disgrace  is to be dishonest  but none at all to be poor from the economy she purposes to observe in her elevation  let even ladies of condition learn  that there are family employments  in which they may and ought to make themselves useful  and give good examples to their inferiors  as well as equals  and that their duty to god charity to the poor and sick  and the different branches of household management  ought to take up the most considerable portions of their time from her signal veracity  which she never forfeited  in all the hardships she was tried with  though her answers  as she had reason to apprehend  would often make against her  and the innocence she preserved throughout all her stratagems and contrivances to save herself from violation  persons  even sorely tempted  may learn to preserve a sacred regard to truth  which always begets a reverence for them  even in the corruptest minds     in short     her obliging behaviour to her equals  before her exaltation  her       kindness to them afterwards  her forgiving spirit  and her       generosity     her meekness  in every circumstance where her virtue was not       concerned     her charitable allowances for others  as in the case of miss       godfrey  for faults she would not have forgiven in herself     her kindness and prudence to the offspring of that melancholy       adventure     her maiden and bridal purity  which extended as well to her       thoughts as to her words and actions     her signal affiance in god     her thankful

english  start of this project gutenberg ebook the people of the mist produced by john bickers  dagny the people of the mist by h  rider haggard first published dedication i dedicate this effort of primeval and troglodyte imagination this record of barefaced and flagrant adventure to my godsons in the hope that therein they may find some store of healthy amusement ditchingham  author s note on several previous occasions it has happened to this writer of romance to be justified of his romances by facts of startling similarity subsequently brought to light and to his knowledge  in this tale occurs an instance of the sort  a double barrelled  instance indeed  that to him seems sufficiently curious to be worthy of telling  the people of the mist of his adventure story worship a sacred crocodile to which they make sacrifice  but in the original draft of the book this crocodile was a snake monstrum horrendum  informe  ingens  a friend of the writer an african explorer of great experience who read that draft  suggested that the snake was altogether too unprecedented and impossible accordingly  also at his suggestion  a crocodile was substituted scarcely was this change effected  however  when mr  r  t  coryndon  the slayer of almost the last white rhinoceros  published in the african review  of february   an account of a huge and terrific serpent said to exist in the dichwi district of mashonaland  that in many particulars resembled the snake of the story  whose prototype  by the way  really lives and is adored as a divinity by certain natives in the remote province of chiapas in mexico  still  the tale being in type  the alteration was suffered to stand  but now  if the zoutpansberg review may be believed  the author can take credit for his crocodile also since that paper states that in the course of the recent campaign against malaboch  a chief living in the north of the transvaal  his fetish or god was captured  and that god  a crocodile fashioned in wood to which offerings were made  further  this journal says that among these people as with the ancient egyptians  the worship of the crocodile is a recognised cult  also it congratulates the present writer on his intimate acquaintance with the more secret manifestations of african folklore and beast worship  he must disclaim the compliment in this instance as  when engaged in inventing the people of the mist he was totally ignorant that any of the bantu tribes reverenced either snake or crocodile divinities  but the coincidence is strange  and once more shows  if further examples of the fact are needed  how impotent are the efforts of imagination to vie with hidden truths even with the hidden truths of this small and trodden world september   the people of the mist chapter i the sins of the father are visited on the children the january afternoon was passing into night  the air was cold and still  so still that not a single twig of the naked beech trees stirred on the grass of the meadows lay a thin white rime  half frost  half snow  the firs stood out blackly against a steel hued sky  and over the tallest of them hung a single star  past these bordering firs there ran a road  on which  in this evening of the opening of our story  a young man stood irresolute  glancing now to the right and now to the left to his right were two stately gates of iron fantastically wrought supported by stone pillars on whose summits stood griffins of black marble embracing coats of arms  and banners inscribed with the device per ardua ad astra  beyond these gates ran a broad carriage drive lined on either side by a double row of such oaks as england alone can produce under the most favourable circumstances of soil  aided by the nurturing hand of man and three or four centuries of time at the head of this avenue  perhaps half a mile from the roadway although it looked nearer because of the eminence upon which it was placed  stood a mansion of the class that in auctioneers  advertisements is usually described as noble  its general appearance was elizabethan for in those days some forgotten outram had practically rebuilt it  but a large part of its fabric was far more ancient than the tudors dating back  so said tradition  to the time of king john  as we are not auctioneers  however  it will be unnecessary to specify its many beauties  indeed  at this date  some of the tribe had recently employed their gift of language on these attractions with copious fulness and accuracy of detail  since outram hall  for the first time during six centuries  was  or had been  for sale suffice it to say that  like the oaks of its avenue  outram was such a house as can only be found in england  no mere mass of bricks and mortar  but a thing that seemed to have acquired a life and individuality of its own  or  if this saying be too far fetched and poetical  at the least this venerable home bore some stamp and trace of the lives and individualities of many generations of mankind  linked together in thought and feeling by the common bond of blood the young man who stood in the roadway looked long and earnestly towards the mass of buildings that frowned upon him from the crest of the hill and as he looked an expression came into his face which fell little  if at all  short of that of agony  the agony which the young can feel at the shock of an utter and irredeemable loss  the face that wore such evidence of trouble was a handsome one enough  though just now all the charm of youth seemed to have faded from it  it was dark and strong  nor was it difficult to guess that in after life it might become stern  the form also was shapely and athletic  though not very tall  giving promise of more than common strength  and the bearing that of a gentleman who had not brought himself up to the belief that ancient blood can cover modern deficiencies of mind and manner  such was the outward appearance of leonard outram as he was then  in his twenty third year while leonard watched and hesitated on the roadway  unable  apparently to make up his mind to pass those iron gates  and yet desirous of doing so  carts and carriages began to appear hurrying down the avenue towards him i suppose that the sale is over  he muttered to himself  well  like death  it is a good thing to have done with then he turned to go  but hearing the crunch of wheels close at hand stepped back into the shadow of the gateway pillar  fearing lest he should be recognised on the open road  a carriage came up  and  just as it reached the gates  something being amiss with the harness  a footman descended from the box to set it right  from where he stood leonard could see its occupants  the wife and daughter of a neighbouring squire and overhear their conversation  he knew them well  indeed  the younger lady had been one of his favourite partners at the county balls how cheap the things went  ida  fancy buying that old oak sideboard for ten pounds  and with all those outram quarterings on it too  it is as good as an historical document  and i am sure that it must be worth at least fifty  i shall sell ours and put it into the dining room  i have coveted that sideboard for years the daughter sighed and answered with some asperity i am so sorry for the outrams that i should not care about the sideboard if you had got it for twopence  what an awful smash  just think of the old place being bought by a jew  tom and leonard are utterly ruined  they say  not a sixpence left  i declare i nearly cried when i saw that man selling leonard s guns very sad indeed  answered the mother absently  but if he is a jew what does it matter  he has a title  and they say that he is enormously rich  i expect there will be plenty going on at outram soon  by the way my dear ida  i do wish you would cure yourself of the habit of calling young men by their christian names not that it matters about these two for we shall never see any more of them i am sure i hope that we shall  said ida defiantly  and when we do i shall call them by their christian names as much as ever  you never objected to it before the smash  and i love  both of them  so there why did you bring me to that horrid sale  you know i did not want to go i shall be wretched for a week  i  and the carriage swept on out of hearing leonard emerged from the shadow of the gateway and crossed the road swiftly  on the further side of it he paused  and looking after the retreating carriage said aloud  god bless you for your kind heart  ida hatherley  good luck go with you  and now for the other business a hundred yards or so down the road  was a second gate of much less imposing appearance than those which led to the outram hall  leonard passed through it and presently found himself at the door of a square red brick house  built with no other pretensions than to those of comfort  this was the rectory  now tenanted by the reverend and honourable james beach  to whom the living had been presented many years before by leonard s father  mr  beach s old college friend leonard rang the bell  and as its distant clamour fell upon his ears a new fear struck him  what sort of reception would he meet with in this house  he wondered  hitherto his welcome had always been so cordial that until this moment he had never doubted of it  but now circumstances were changed  he was no longer in the position of second son to sir thomas outram of outram hall  he was a beggar  an outcast  a wanderer  the son of a fraudulent bankrupt and suicide  the careless words of the woman in the carriage had let a flood of light into his mind  and by it he saw many things which he had never seen before  now he remembered a little motto that he had often heard  but the full force of which he did not appreciate until to day  friends follow fortune  was the wording of this motto  he remembered also another saying that had frequently been read to him in church and elsewhere  and the origin of which precluded all doubt as to its truth unto every one that hath shall be given  but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath now  as it chanced  leonard  beggared as he was  had still something left which could be taken away from him  and that something the richest fortune which providence can give to any man in his youth  the love of a woman whom he also loved  the reverend and honourable james beach was blessed with a daughter  jane by name  who had the reputation  not undeserved  of being the most beautiful and sweetest natured girl that the country side could show  now  being dark and fair respectively and having lived in close association since childhood  leonard and jane  as might be expected from the working of the laws of natural economy  had gravitated towards each other with increasing speed ever since they had come to understand the possibilities of the institution of marriage in the end thus mutual gravitation led to a shock and confusion of individualities which was not without its charm  or  to put the matter more plainly  leonard proposed to jane and had been accepted with many blushes and some tears and kisses it was a common little romance enough  but  like everything else with which youth and love are concerned  it had its elements of beauty  such affairs gain much from being the first in the series  who is there among us that does not adore his first love and his first poem  and yet when we see them twenty years after presently the rectory door was opened and leonard entered  at this moment it occurred to him that he did not quite know why he had come  to be altogether accurate  he knew why he had come well enough  it was to see jane  and arrive at an understanding with her father  perhaps it may be well to explain that his engagement to that young lady was of the suppressed order  her parents had no wish to suppress it  indeed  for though leonard was a younger son  it was well known that he was destined to inherit his mother s fortune of fifty thousand pounds more or less besides  providence had decreed a delicate constitution to his elder and only brother thomas  but sir thomas outram  their father  was reputed to be an ambitious man who looked to see his sons marry well  and this marriage would scarcely have been to leonard s advantage from the family lawyer point of view therefore  when the matter came to the ears of jane s parents  they determined to forego the outward expression of their pride and delight in the captive whom they owed to the bow and spear of their daughter s loveliness  at any rate for a while  say until leonard had taken his degree  often and often in the after years did they have occasion to bless themselves for their caution  but not the less on this account was leonard s position as the affianced lover of their daughter recognised among them  indeed  the matter was no secret from anybody  except perhaps from sir thomas himself  for his part  leonard took no pains to conceal it even from him  but the father and son met rarely  and the estrangement between them was so complete  that the younger man saw no advantage in speaking of a matter thus near to his heart until there appeared to be a practical object in so doing the rev  james beach was a stout person of bland and prepossessing appearance  never had he looked stouter  more prepossessing  or blander than on this particular evening when leonard was ushered into his presence  he was standing before the fire in his drawing room holding a huge and ancient silver loving cup in both hands  and in such a position as to give the observer the idea that he had just drained its entire contents  in reality  it may be explained  he was employed in searching for a hall mark on the bottom of the goblet  discoursing the while to his wife and children for jane had a brother upon its value and beauty  the gleam of the silver caught leonard s eye as he entered the room  and he recognised the cup as one of the heirlooms of his own family leonard s sudden and unlooked for advent brought various emotions into active play  there were four people gathered round that comfortable fire the rector  his wife  his son  and last  but not least  jane herself  mr  beach dropped the cup sufficiently to allow himself to stare at his visitor along its length  for all the world as though he were covering him with a silver blunderbuss  his wife  an active little woman  turned round as if she moved upon wires  exclaiming  good gracious  who d have thought it  while the son  a robust young man of about leonard s own age and his college companion  said hullo  old fellow  well  i never expected to see you  here to day a remark which  however natural it may have been  scarcely tended to set his friend at ease jane herself  a tall and beautiful girl with bright auburn hair  who was seated on a footstool nursing her knees before the fire  and paying very little heed to her father s lecture upon ancient plate  did none of these things  on the contrary  she sprang up with the utmost animation her lips apart and her lovely face red with blushes  or the heat of the fire  and came towards him exclaiming  oh  leonard  dear leonard mr  beach turned the silver blunderbuss upon his daughter and fired a single  but most effective shot jane  he said in a voice in which fatherly admonition and friendly warning were happily blended jane stopped in full career was though in obedience to some lesson which momentarily she had forgotten  then mr  beach  setting down the flagon advanced upon leonard with an ample pitying smile and outstretched hand how are you  my dear boy  how are you  he said  we did not expect to see me here under the circumstances  put in leonard bitterly  nor would you have done so  but tom and i understood that it was only to be a three days  sale quite right  leonard  as first advertised the sale was for three days but the auctioneer found that he could not get through in the time  the accumulations of such an ancient house as outram hall are necessarily vast  and he waved his hand with a large gesture yes  said leonard hum  went on mr  beach  after a pause which was beginning to grow awkward  doubtless you will find it a matter for congratulation that on the whole things sold well  it is not always the case  not by any means  for such collections as those of outram  however interesting and valuable they may have been to the family itself  do not often fetch their worth at a country auction  yes  they sold decidedly well  thanks chiefly to the large purchases of the new owner of the estate  this tankard  for instance  which i have bought hem as a slight memento of your family  cost me ten shillings an ounce indeed  answered leonard coldly  i always understood that it was worth fifty then came another pause  during which all who were present  except mr beach and himself  rose one by one and quitted the room  jane was the last to go  and leonard noticed  as she passed him  that there were tears in her eyes jane  said her father in a meaning voice when her hand was already on the door  you will be careful to be dressed in time for dinner  will you not  love  you remember that young mr  cohen is coming  and i should like somebody to be down to receive him jane s only answer to this remark was to pass through the door and slam it behind her  clearly the prospect of the advent of this guest was not agreeable to her well  leonard  went on mr  beach when they were alone  in a tone that was meant to be sympathetic but which jarred horribly on his listener s ears  this is a sad business  very sad  but why are you not sitting down because no one asked me to  said leonard as he took a chair hem  continued mr  beach  by the way i believe that mr  cohen is a friend of yours  is he not an acquaintance  not a friend  said leonard indeed  i thought that you were at the same college yes  but i do not like him prejudice  my dear boy  prejudice  a minor sin indeed  but one against which you must struggle  but there  there  it is natural that you should not feel warmly about the man who will one day own outram  ah  as i said  this is all very sad  but it must be a great consolation to you to remember that when everything is settled there will be enough  so i am told  to pay your unhappy father s debts  and now  is there anything that i can do for you or your brother leonard reflected that whatever may have been his father s misdeeds  and they were many and black  it should scarcely have lain in the mouth of the rev  james beach  who owed nearly everything he had in the world to his kindness  to allude to them  but he could not defend his father s memory  it was beyond defence  and just now he must fight for his own hand yes  mr  beach  he said earnestly  you can help me very much  you know the cruel position in which my brother and i are placed through no fault of our own  our old home is sold  our fortunes have gone utterly and our honourable name is tarnished  at the present moment i have nothing left in the world except the sum of two hundred pounds which i had saved for a purpose of my own out of my allowance  i have no profession and cannot even take my degree  because i am unable to afford the expense of remaining at college black  i must say  very black  murmured mr  beach  rubbing his chin but under these circumstances what can i do to help you  you must trust in providence  my boy  it never fails the deserving this  answered leonard  nervously  you can show your confidence in me by allowing my engagement to jane to be proclaimed  here mr  beach waved his hand once more as though to repel some invisible force one moment  continued leonard  i know that it seems a great deal to ask  but listen  although everything looks so dark  i have reliance on myself  with the stimulus which my affection for your daughter will give me  and knowing that in order to win her i must first put myself in a position to support her as she should be supported  i am quite convinced that i shall be able to surmount all difficulties by my own efforts really  i cannot listen to such nonsense any longer  broke in mr beach angrily  leonard  this is nothing less than an impertinence  of course any understanding that may have existed between you and jane is quite at an end  engagement  i heard of no engagement  i knew that there was some boy and girl folly between you indeed  but for my part i never gave the matter another thought you seem to forget  sir  said leonard  keeping his temper with difficulty  that not six months ago you and i had a long conversation on this very subject  and decided that nothing should be said to my father of the matter until i had taken my degree i repeat that it is an impertinence  answered mr  beach  but with a careful avoidance of the direct issue  what  you  who have nothing in the world except a name which you father has well tarnished to use your own word  you ask me for my dear daughter s hand  you are so selfish that you wish not only to ruin her chances in life  but also to drag her into the depths of your poverty  leonard  i should never have thought it of you then at last leonard broke out you do not speak the truth  i did not ask you for your daughter s hand i asked you for the promise of it when i should have shown myself worthy of her  but now there is an end of that  i will go as you bid me but before i go i will tell you the truth  you wish to use jane s beauty to catch this jew with  of her happiness you think nothing  provided only you can secure his money  she is not a strong character  and it is quite possible that you will succeed in your plot  but i tell you it will not prosper  you  who owe everything to our family  now when trouble has overtaken us  turn upon me and rob me of the only good that was left to me  by putting an end to a connection of which everybody knew  you stamp me still deeper into the mire  so be it  but of this i am sure  that such conduct will meet with a due reward  and that a time will come when you will bitterly regret the way in which you have dealt with your daughter and treated me in my misfortunes  good bye and leonard turned and left the room and the rectory chapter ii the swearing of the oath arthur beach  jane s brother  was standing in the hall waiting to speak to leonard  but he passed without a word  closing the hall door behind him  outside snow was falling  though not fast enough to obscure the light of the moon which shone through the belt of firs leonard walked on down the drive till he neared the gate  when suddenly he heard the muffled sound of feet pursuing him through the snow  he turned with an exclamation  believing that the footsteps were those of arthur beach  for at the moment he was in no mood for further conversation with any male member of that family  as it chanced however  he found himself face to face not with arthur  but with jane herself  who perhaps had never looked more beautiful than she did at this moment in the snow and the moonlight  indeed  whenever leonard thought of her in after years  and that was often  there arose in his mind a vision of a tall and lovely girl  her auburn hair slightly powdered over with the falling flakes  her breast heaving with emotion and her wide grey eyes gazing piteously upon him oh  leonard  she said nervously  why do you go without saying good bye to me he looked at her awhile before he answered  for something in his heart told him that this was the last sight which he should win of his love for many a year  and therefore his eyes dwelt upon her as we gaze upon one whom the grave is about to hide from us for ever at last he spoke  and his words were practical enough you should not have come out in those thin shoes through the snow jane  you will catch cold i wish i could  she answered defiantly  i wish that i could catch such a cold as would kill me  then i should be out of my troubles  let us go into the summer house  they will never think of looking for me there how will you get there  asked leonard  it is a hundred yards away and the snow always drifts in that path oh  never mind the snow  she said but leonard did mind it  and presently he hit upon a solution of the difficulty  having first glanced up the drive to see that nobody was coming  he bent forward and without explanation or excuse put his arms around jane  and lifting her as though she were a child  he bore her down the path which led to the summer house  she was heavy  but  sooth to say  he could have wished the journey longer  presently they were there  and very gently he laid her on her feet again  kissing her upon the lips as he did so  then he took off his overcoat and wrapped it round her shoulders all this while jane had not spoken  indeed  the poor girl felt so happy and so safe in her lover s arms that it seemed to her as though she never wished to speak  or to do anything for herself again  it was leonard who broke the silence you ask me why i left without saying good bye to you  jane  it was because your father has dismissed me from the house and forbidden me to have any more to do with you oh  why  asked the girl  lifting her hands despairingly can t you guess  he answered with a bitter laugh yes  leonard  she whispered  taking his hand in sympathy perhaps i had better put it plainly  said leonard again  it may prevent misunderstandings  your father has dismissed me because my father embezzled all my money  the sins of the father are visited upon the children  you see  also he has done this with more than usual distinctness and alacrity  because he wishes you to marry young mr cohen  the bullion broker and the future owner of outram jane shivered i know  i know  she said  and oh  leonard  i hate him then perhaps it will be as well not to marry him  he answered i would rather die first  she said with conviction unfortunately one can t always die when it happens to be convenient jane oh  leonard  don t be horrid  she said  beginning to cry  where are you going  and what shall i do to the bad probably  he answered  at least it all depends upon you look here  jane  if you will stick to me i will stick to you  the luck is against me now  but i have it in me to see that through  i love you and i would work myself to death for you  but at the best it must be a question of time  probably of years oh  leonard  indeed i will if i can  i am sure that you do not love me more than i love you  but i can never make you understand how odious they all are to me about you  especially papa confound him  said leonard beneath his breath  and if jane heard  at that moment her filial affections were not sufficiently strong to induce her to remonstrate well  jane  he went on  the matter lies thus  either you must put up with their treatment or you must give me the go by  listen  in six months you will be twenty one  and in this country all her relations put together can t force a woman to marry a man if she does not wish to  or prevent her from marrying one whom she does wish to marry  now you know my address at my club in town  letters sent there will always reach me and it is scarcely possible for your father or anybody else to prevent you from writing and posting a letter  if you want my help or to communicate in any way  i shall expect to hear from you  and if need be i will take you away and marry you the moment you come of age  if  on the other hand  i do not hear from you  i shall know that it is because you do not choose to write  or because that which you have to write would be too painful for me to read  do you understand  jane oh  yes  leonard  but you put things so hardly things have been put hardly enough to me  love  and i must be plain this is my last chance of speaking to you at this moment an ominous sound echoed through the night  it was none other than the distant voice of mr  beach  calling from his front door step  jane  are you out there  jane oh  heavens  she said  there is my father calling me  i came out by the back door  but mother must have been up to my room and found me gone  she watches me all day now  what shall  i do go back and tell them that you have been saying good bye to me  it is not a crime  they cannot kill you for it indeed they can  or just as bad  replied jane  then suddenly she threw her arms about her lover s neck and burying her beautiful face upon his breast  she began to sob bitterly  murmuring  oh my darling  my darling  what shall i do without you over the brief and distressing scene which followed it may be well to drop a veil  leonard s bitterness of mind forsook him now  and he kissed her and comforted her as he might best  even going so far as to mingle his tears with hers  tears of which he had no cause to be ashamed  at length she tore herself loose  for the shouts were growing louder and more insistent i forgot  she sobbed  here is a farewell present for you  keep it in memory of me  leonard  and thrusting her hand into the bosom of her dress she drew from it a little packet which she gave to him then once more they kissed and clung together  and in another moment she had vanished back into the snow and darkness  passing out of leonard s sight and out of his life  though from his mind she could never pass a farewell present  keep it in memory of me  the words yet echoed in his ears  and to leonard they seemed fateful a prophecy of utter loss sighing heavily  he opened the packet and examined its contents by the feeble moonlight  they were not large  a prayer book bound in morocco her own  with her name on the fly leaf and a short inscription beneath and in the pocket of its cover a lock of auburn hair tied round with silk an unlucky gift  said leonard to himself  then putting on his coat which was yet warm from jane s shoulders  he also turned and vanished into the snow and the night  shaping his path towards the village inn he reached it in due course  and passed into the little parlour that adjoined the bar  it was a comfortable room enough  notwithstanding its adornments of badly stuffed birds and fishes  and chiefly remarkable for its wide old fashioned fireplace with wrought iron dogs  there was no lamp in the room when leonard entered  but the light of the burning wood was bright  and by it he could see his brother seated in a high backed chair gazing into the fire  his hand resting on his knee thomas outram was leonard s elder by two years and cast in a more fragile mould  his face was the face of a dreamer  the brown eyes were large and reflective  and the mouth sensitive as a child s  he was a scholar and a philosopher  a man of much desultory reading  with refined tastes and a really intimate knowledge of greek gems is that you  leonard  he said  looking up absently  where have you been to the rectory  answered his brother what have you been doing there do you want to know yes  of course  did you see jane then leonard told him all the story what do you think she will do  asked tom when his brother had finished  given the situation and the woman  it is rather a curious problem it may be  answered leonard  but as i am not an equation in algebra yearning to be worked out  i don t quite see the fun of it  but if you ask me what i think she will do  i should say that she will follow the example of everybody else and desert me you seem to have a poor idea of women  old fellow  i know little of them myself and don t want to know more  but i have always understood that it is the peculiar glory of their sex to come out strong on these exceptional occasions  woman in our hours of ease  etc well  we shall see  but it is my opinion that women think a great deal more of their own hours of ease than of those of anybody else  thank heaven  here comes our dinner thus spoke leonard  somewhat cynically and perhaps not in the best of taste  but  his rejoicing over its appearance notwithstanding  he did not do much justice to the dinner when it arrived  indeed  it would be charitable to make allowances for this young man at that period of his life  he had sustained a most terrible reverse  and do what he might he could never quite escape from the shadow of his father s disgrace or put out of his mind the stain with which his father had dimmed the honour of his family  and now a new misfortune hung over him  he had just been driven with contumely from a house where hitherto he was the most welcome of guests  he had parted  moreover  from the woman whom he loved dearly  and under circumstances which made it doubtful if their separation would not be final leonard possessed the gift of insight into character  and more common sense than can often be expected from a young man in love  he knew well that the chief characteristic of jane s nature was a tendency to yield to the circumstances of the hour  and though he hoped against hope he could find no reason to suppose that she would exhibit greater determination in the matter of their engagement than her general lack of strength might lead him to anticipate  besides  and here his common sense came in  would it be wise that she should do so  after all what had he to offer her  and were not his hopes of future advancement nothing better than a dream  roughly as he had put it  perhaps mr beach was right when he told him that he  leonard  was both selfish and impertinent  since was it not a selfish impertinence in him to ask any woman to link her fortune with his in the present state of his affairs let us therefore make excuses for his words and outward behaviour  for at heart leonard had much to trouble him when the cloth had been cleared away and they were alone again  tom spoke to his brother  who was moodily filling his pipe what shall we do to night  leonard  he said go to bed  i suppose  he answered see here  leonard  said his brother again  what do you say to having a last look at the old place if you wish  tom  but it will be painful a little pain more or less can scarcely hurt us  old fellow  said tom laying his thin hand on his brother s shoulder then they started  a quarter of an hour s walking brought them to the hall  the snow had ceased falling now and the night was beautifully clear  but before it ceased it had done a welcome office in hiding from view all the litter and wreckage of the auction  which make the scene of a recent sale one of the most desolate sights in the world  never had the old house looked grander or more eloquent of the past than it did on that night to the two brothers who were dispossessed of their heritage they wandered round it in silence  gazing affectionately at each well known tree and window  till at length they came to the gun room entrance  more from habit than for any other reason leonard turned the handle of the door  to his surprise it was open  after the confusion of the sale no one had remembered to lock it let us go in  he said they entered and wandered from room to room till they reached the greater hall  a vast and oak roofed chamber built after the fashion of the nave of a church  and lighted by a large window of ecclesiastical design  this window was filled with the armorial bearings of many generations of the outram family  wrought in stained glass and placed in couples  for next to each coat of arms were the arms of its bearer s dame  it was not quite full  however  for in it remained two blank shields  which had been destined to receive the escutcheons of thomas outram and his wife they will never be filled now  leonard  said tom  pointing to these curious  isn t it  not to say sad oh  i don t know  answered his brother  i suppose that the cohens boast some sort of arms  or if not they can buy them i should think that they would have the good taste to begin a new window for themselves  said tom then he was silent for a while  and they watched the moonlight streaming through the painted window  the memorial of so much forgotten grandeur and illumining the portraits of many a dead outram that gazed upon them from the panelled walls per ardua ad astra  said tom  absently reading the family motto which alternated pretty regularly with a second device that some members of it had adopted for heart  home  and honour per ardua ad astra through struggle to the stars and for heart home  and honour  repeated tom  well  i think that our family never needed such consolations more  if indeed there are any to be found in mottoes  our heart is broken  our hearth is desolate  and our honour is a byword  but there remain the struggle and the stars as he spoke his face took the fire of a new enthusiasm  leonard he went on  why should not we retrieve the past  let us take that motto the more ancient one for an omen  and let us fulfil it  i believe it is a good omen  i believe that one of us will fulfil it we can try  answered leonard  if we fail in the struggle  at least the stars remain for us as for all human kind leonard  said his brother almost in a whisper  will you swear an oath with me  it seems childish  but i think that under some circumstances there is wisdom even in childishness what oath  asked leonard this  that we will leave england and seek fortune in some foreign land sufficient fortune to enable us to repurchase our lost home  that we will never return here until we have won this fortune  and that death alone shall put a stop to our quest leonard hesitated a moment  then answered if jane fails me  i will swear it tom glanced round as though in search of some familiar object  and presently his eye fell upon what he sought  a great proportion of the furniture of the old house  including the family portraits  had been purchased by the in coming owner  among the articles which remained was a very valuable and ancient bible  one of the first ever printed indeed that stood upon an oaken stand in the centre of the hall  to which it was securely chained  tom led the way to this bible  followed by his brother  then they placed their hands upon it  and standing there in the shadow  the elder of them spoke aloud in a voice that left no doubt of the earnestness of his purpose  or of his belief in their mission we swear  he said  upon this book and before the god who made us that we will leave this home that was ours  and never look upon it again till we can call it ours once more  we swear that we will follow this  the purpose of our lives  till death destroys us and it  and may shame and utter ruin overtake us if  while we have strength and reason  we turn our backs upon this oath  so help us god so help us god  repeated leonard thus in the home of their ancestors  in the presence of their maker  and of the pictured dead who had gone before them  did thomas and leonard outram devote their lives to this great purpose  perhaps  as one of them had said  the thing was childish  but if so  at the least it was solemn and touching  their cause seemed hopeless indeed  but if faith can move mountains  much more can honest endeavour attain its ends  in that hour they felt this  yes  they believed that the end would be attained by one of them  though they guessed little what struggles lay between them and the star they hoped to gain  or how strangely they should be borne thither on the morrow they went to london and waited there a while  but no word came from jane beach  and for good or ill the chains of the oath that he had taken riveted themselves around leonard outram s neck within three months of this night the brothers were nearing the shores of africa  the land of the children of the mist chapter iii after seven years what is the time  leonard eleven o clock  tom eleven already  i shall go at dawn  leonard  you remember johnston died at dawn  and so did askew for heaven s sake don t speak like that  tom  if you think you are going to die  you will die the sick man laughed a ghost of a laugh it was half a death rattle it is no use talking  leonard  i feel my life flaring and sinking like a dying fire  my mind is quite clear now  but i shall die at dawn for all that  the fever has burnt me up  have i been raving  leonard a little  old fellow  answered leonard what about home mostly  tom home  we have none  leonard  it is sold  how long have we been away now seven years seven years  yes  do you remember how we said good bye to the old place on that winter night after the auction  and do you remember what we resolved yes repeat it we swore that we would seek wealth enough to buy outram back till we won it or died  and that we would never return to england till it was won  then we sailed for africa  for seven years we have sought and done no more than earn a livelihood  much less a couple of hundred thousand pounds or so leonard yes  tom you are sole heir to our oath now  and to the old name with it  or you will be in a few hours  i have fulfilled my vow  i have sought till i died  you will take up the quest till you succeed or die  the struggle has been mine  may you live to win the star  you will persevere  will you not  leonard yes  tom  i will give me your hand on it  old fellow leonard outram knelt down beside his dying brother  and they clasped each other s hands now let me sleep awhile  i am tired  do not be afraid  i shall wake before the end hardly had the words passed his lips when his eyes closed and he sank into stupor or sleep his brother leonard sat down upon a rude seat  improvised out of an empty gin case  without the tempest shrieked and howled  the great wind shook the kaffir hut of grass and wattle  piercing it in a hundred places till the light of the lantern wavered within its glass  and the sick man s hair was lifted from his clammy brow  from time to time fierce squalls of rain fell like sheets of spray  and the water penetrating the roof of grass  streamed to the earthen floor  leonard crept on his hands and knees to the doorway of the hut  or rather to the low arched opening which served as a doorway  and  removing the board that secured it  looked out at the night  their hut stood upon the ridge of a great mountain  below was a sea of bush  and around it rose the fantastic shapes of other mountains  black clouds drove across the dying moon  but occasionally she peeped out and showed the scene in all its vast solemnity and appalling solitude presently leonard closed the opening of the doorway  and going back to his brother s side he gazed upon him earnestly  many years of toil and privation had not robbed thomas outram s face of its singular beauty  or found power to mar its refinement  but death was written on it leonard sighed  then  struck by a sudden thought  sought for and found a scrap of looking glass  holding it close to the light of the lantern he examined the reflection of his own features  the glass mirrored a handsome bearded man  dark  keen eyed like one who is always on the watch for danger  curly haired and broad shouldered  not very tall  but having massive limbs and a form which showed strength in every movement though he was still young  there was little of youth left about the man clearly toil and struggle had done an evil work with him  ageing his mind and hardening it as they had hardened the strength and vigour of his body  the face was a good one  but most men would have preferred to see friendship shining in those piercing black eyes rather than the light of enmity  leonard was a bad enemy  and his long striving with the world sometimes led him to expect foes where they did not exist even now this thought was in his mind  he is dying  he said to himself  as he laid down the glass with the care of a man who cannot afford to hazard a belonging however trivial  and yet his face is not so changed as mine is  my god  he is dying  my brother the only man the only living creature i love in the world  except one perhaps if indeed i love her still  everything is against us i should say against me now  for i cannot count him  our father was our first enemy he brought us into the world  neglected us  squandered our patrimony dishonoured our name  and shot himself  and since then what has it been but one continual fight against men and nature  even the rocks in which i dig for gold are foes victorious foes  and he glanced at his hands scarred and made unshapely by labour  and the fever  that is a foe death is the only friend  but he won t shake hands with me  he takes my brother whom i love as he has taken the others  but me he leaves thus mused leonard sitting sullenly on the red box  his elbow on his knee  his rough hands held beneath his chin pushing forward the thick black beard till it threw a huge shadow  angular and unnatural  on to the wall of the hut  while without the tempest now raved  now lulled and now raved again  an hour two passed and still he sat not moving watching the face of the fever stricken man that from time to time flushed and was troubled  then grew pale and still  it seemed to him as though by some strange harmony of nature the death smitten blood was striving to keep pace with the beat of the storm  knowing that presently life and storm would pass together into the same domain of silence at length tom outram opened his eyes and looked at him  but leonard knew that he did not see him as he was  the dying eyes studied him indeed and were intelligent  but he could feel that they read something on his face that was not known to himself  nor could be visible to any other man read it as though it were a writing so strange was this scrutiny  so meaningless and yet so full of a meaning which he could not grasp  that leonard shrank beneath it  he spoke to his brother  but no answer came only the great hollow eyes read on in that book which was printed upon his face  that book  sealed to him  but to the dying man an open writing the sight of the act of death is always terrible  it is terrible to watch the latest wax and ebb of life  and with the intelligence to comprehend that these flickerings  this coming and this going  these sinkings and these last recoveries are the trial flights of the animating and eternal principle call it soul or what you will before it trusts itself afar  still more terrible is it under circumstances of physical and mental desolation such as those present to leonard outram in that hour but he had looked on death before  on death in many dreadful shapes  and yet he had never been so much afraid  what was it that his brother or the spirit of his brother  read in his face  what learning had he gathered in that sleep of his  the last before the last  he could not tell now he longed to know  now he was glad not to know  and now he strove to overcome his fears my nerves are shattered  he said to himself  he is dying  how shall i bear to see him die a gust of wind shook the hut  rending the thatch apart  and through the rent a little jet of rain fell upon his brother s forehead and ran down his pallid cheeks like tears  then the strange understanding look passed from the wide eyes  and once more they became human  and the lips were opened water  they murmured leonard gave him to drink  with one hand holding the pannikin to his brother s mouth and with the other supporting the dying head  twice he gulped at it  then with a brusque motion of his wasted arm he knocked the cup aside  spilling the water on the earthen floor leonard  he said  you will succeed succeed in what  tom you will get the money and outram and found the family afresh but you will not do it alone  a woman will help you then his mind wandered a little and he muttered  how is jane  have you heard from jane  or some such words at the mention of this name leonard s face softened  then once more grew hard and anxious i have not heard of jane for years  old fellow  he said  probably she is dead or married  but i do not understand don t waste time  leonard  tom answered  rousing himself from his lethargy  listen to me  i am going fast  you know dying men see far sometimes  i dreamed it  or i read it in your face  i tell you you  will die at outram  stay here a while after i am dead  stay a while  leonard he sank back exhausted  and at that moment a gust of wind  fiercer than any which had gone before  leapt down the mountain gorges  howling with all the voices of the storm  it caught the frail hut and shook it  a cobra hidden in the thick thatch awoke from its lethargy and fell with a soft thud to the floor not a foot from the face of the dying man then erected itself and hissed aloud with flickering tongue and head swollen by rage  leonard started back and seized a crowbar which stood near  but before he could strike  the reptile sank down and  drawing its shining shape across his brother s forehead  once more vanished into the thatch his eyes did not so much as close  though leonard saw a momentary reflection of the bright scales in the dilated pupils and shivered at this added terror  shivered as though his own flesh had shrunk beneath the touch of those deadly coils  it was horrible that the snake should creep across his brother s face  it was still more horrible that his brother  yet living  should not understand the horror  it caused him to remember our invisible companion  that ancient enemy of mankind of whom the reptile is an accepted type  it made him think of that long sleep which the touch of such as this has no power to stir ah  now he was going it was impossible to mistake that change  the last quick quiver of the blood  followed by an ashen pallor  and the sob of the breath slowly lessening into silence  so the day had died last night  with a little purpling of the sky a little sobbing of the wind then ashen nothingness and silence  but the silence was broken the night had grown alive indeed and with a fearful life  hark  how the storm yelled  those blasts told of torment  that rain beat like tears what if his brother he did not dare to follow the thought home hark  how the storm yelled the very hut wrenched at its strong supports as though the hands of a hundred savage foes were dragging it it lifted by heaven it was gone gone  crashing down the rocks on the last hurricane blast of the tempest  and there above them lowered the sullen blue of the passing night flecked with scudding clouds  and there in front of them  to the east and between the mountains  flared the splendours of the dawn something had struck leonard heavily  so heavily that the blood ran down his face  he did not heed it  he scarcely felt it  he only clasped his brother in his arms and  for the first time for many years  he kissed him on the brow  staining it with the blood from his wound the dying man looked up  he saw the glory in the east  now it ran along the mountain sides  now it burned upon their summits  to each summit a pillar of flame  a peculiar splendour of its own diversely shaped  and now the shapes of fire leaped from earth to heaven  peopling the sky with light  the dull clouds caught the light  but they could not hold it all  back it fell to earth again  and the forests lifted up their arms to greet it  and it shone upon the face of the waters thomas outram saw and staggering to his knees he stretched out his arms towards the rising sun  muttering with his lips then he sank upon leonard s breast  and presently all his story was told chapter iv the last vigil for a while leonard sat by the body of his brother  the daylight grew and gathered about him  the round ball of the sun appeared above the mountains the storm was gone  were it not for some broken fragments of the vanished hut  it would have been difficult to know even that it had been  insects began to chirrup  lizards ran from the crevices of the rocks  yonder the rain washed bud of a mountain lily opened before his eyes  still leonard sat on  his face stony with grief  till at length a shadow fell upon him from above  he looked up it was cast by a vulture s wings  as they hurried to the place of death grasping his loaded rifle leonard sprang to his feet  nearer and nearer came the bird  wheeling above him in lessening circles  it forgot the presence of the living in its desire for the dead  leonard lifted the rifle  aimed and fired  the report rang out clearly on the silent air and was echoed from krantz and kloof and mountain side  and from above answered the thud of the bullet  for a moment the smitten bird swayed upon its wide pinions  then they seemed to crumple beneath its weight and it fell heavily and lay flapping and striking at the stones with its strong beak i also can kill  said leonard to himself as he watched it die  kill till you are killed that is the law of life  then he turned to the body of his brother and made it ready for burial as best he might closing the eyes  tying up the chin with a band of twisted grass  and folding the thin toil worn hands upon the quiet heart when all was finished he paused from his dreadful task  and a thought struck him where are those kaffirs  he said aloud the sound of his voice seemed to dull the edge of solitude the lazy hounds  they ought to have been up an hour ago  hi  otter  otter the mountains echoed otter  otter  there was no other reply  again he shouted without result  i don t like to leave it  he said  but i must go and see  and  having covered the body with a red blanket to scare away the vultures  he started at a run round some projecting rocks that bordered the little plateau on which the hut had stood  beyond them the plateau continued  and some fifty paces from the rocks was a hollow in the mountain side  where a softer vein of stone had been eaten away by centuries of weather it was here that the kaffirs slept four of them and in front of this cave or grotto it was their custom to make a fire for cooking  but on that morning no fire was burning  and no kaffirs were to be seen still asleep  was leonard s comment as he strode swiftly towards the cave  in another moment he was in it shouting otter  otter  and saluting with a vigorous kick a prostrate form  of which he could just see the outline  the form did not move  which was strange  for such a kick should have suffered to wake even the laziest basuto from his soundest sleep  leonard stopped to examine it  and the next moment started back violently  exclaiming great heavens  it is cheat  and he is dead at this moment a thick voice spoke from the corner of the cave in dutch the voice of otter i am here  baas  but i am tied  the baas must loosen me  i cannot stir leonard advanced  striking a match as he came  presently it burned up and he saw the man otter lying on his back  his legs and arms bound firmly with rimpis of hide  his face and body a mass of contusions drawing his hunting knife leonard cut the rimpis and brought the man from out the cave  carrying rather than leading him otter was a knob nosed kaffir  that is of the bastard zulu race the brothers had found him wandering about the country in a state of semi starvation  and he had served them faithfully for some years they had christened him otter  his native patronymic being quite unpronounceable  because of his extraordinary skill in swimming  which almost equalled that of the animal after which he was named in face the man was hideous  though his ugliness was not unpleasant being due chiefly to a great development of his tribal feature  the nose  and in body he was misshapen to the verge of monstrosity  in fact otter was a dwarf  measuring little more than four feet in height  but what he lacked in height he made up in breadth  it almost seemed as though  intended by nature to be a man of many inches  he had been compressed to his present dimensions by art  his vast chest and limbs indicating strength nearly superhuman  his long iron arms and massive head  all gave colour to this idea  otter had one redeeming feature however his eyes  that when visible  which at this moment was not the case  were large  steady  and  like his skin  of a brilliant black what has happened  said leonard  also speaking in dutch this  baas  last night those three basuto villains  your servants  made up their minds to desert  they told me nothing  and they were so cunning that  though i watched even their thoughts  i never guessed  they knew better than to tell me  for i would have beaten them yes  all  so they waited till i was sound asleep  then came behind me  the three of them and tied me fast that i should not hinder them and that they might take away baas tom s gun which you lent me  and other things  soon i found out their plans  and though i laughed in their faces  oh  my heart was black with rage when the basuto dogs had tied me they mocked me  calling me foul names and saying that i might stop and starve with the white fools my masters  who always dug for yellow iron and found so little  being fools  then they got together everything of value  yes  down to the kettle  and made ready to go  and each of them came and slapped me on the face  and one burnt me here upon the nose with a hot brand all this i bore as a man must bear trouble which comes from the skies but when cheat took up baas tom s gun and the others came with a reim to tie me to the rock  i could bear it no more  so i shouted aloud and drove at cheat  who held the gun  ah  they had forgotten that if my arms are strong  my head is stronger  butting like a bull i caught him fair in the middle  and his back was against the side of the cave  he made one noise  no more  he will never make another noise  for my head smashed him up inside and the rock hurt me through him  then the other two hit me with kerries great blows and my arms being tied i could not defend myself  though i knew that they would soon kill me  so i groaned and dropped down  pretending to be dead just like a stink cat at last  thinking that they had finished me  the basutos ran away in a great hurry  for they feared lest you might hear the shouting and should come after them with rifles  they were so much afraid that they left the gun and most of the other things  after that i fainted  it was silly but those kerries of theirs are of rhinoceros horn i should not have minded so much had they been of wood  but the horn bites deep  that is all the story  it will please baas tom to know that i saved his gun when he hears it he will forget his sickness and say well done otter ha  otter  your head is hard make your heart hard also  said leonard with a sad smile  baas tom is dead  he died at daybreak in my arms  the fever killed him as it killed the other inkoosis  chiefs otter heard  and  letting his bruised head fall upon his mighty chest remained for a while in silence  at length he lifted it  and leonard saw two tears wandering down the battered countenance  wow  he said  is it so  oh  my father  are you dead  you who were brave like a lion and gentle as a girl  yes  you are dead  my ears have heard it  and were it not for your brother  the baas leonard  i think that i would kill myself and follow you  wow  my father  are you indeed dead  who smiled upon me yesterday come  said leonard  i dare not leave him long and he went  otter following him with a reeling gait  for he was weak from his injuries  presently they reached the spot  and otter saw that the hut was gone certainly  he said  our bad spirits were abroad last night  well next time it will be the turn of the good ones  then he drew near to the corpse and saluted it with uplifted hand and voice chief and father  he said in zulu  for otter had wandered long and knew many tongues  but he loved the zulu best of all  while you lived upon earth  you were a good man and brave  though somewhat quick of temper and quarrelsome like a woman  now you have wearied of this world and flown away like an eagle towards the sun  and there where you live in the light of the sun you will be braver and better yet  and become more patient and not quarrel any more with those who are less clever than you  chief and father  i salute you  may he whom you named the otter serve you and the inkoosi  your brother once more in the house of the great great  if one so ugly and misshapen can enter there  as for the basuto dog whom i slew and who would have stolen your gun  i see now that i killed him in a fortunate hour  that he might be the slave beneath your feet in the house of the great great  ah  had i known i would have sent a better man  for there as here cheat will still be cheat  hail  my father  hail and farewell  let your spirit watch over us and be gentle towards us  who love you yet and otter turned away without further ado  and having washed his wounds he set himself to the task of preparing such coarse food as they had in store when it was ready leonard ate of it  and after he had finished eating together they bore the body to the little cave for shelter  it was leonard s purpose to bury his brother at sundown  he might not delay longer  but till then he would watch by him  keeping the last of many vigils  so all that remained of the basuto cheat having been dragged forth and thrust unceremoniously into an ant bear hole by otter  who while he disposed of the body did not spare to taunt the spirit of his late treacherous foe  the corpse of thomas outram was laid in its place and leonard sat himself by its side in the gloom of the cave about midday otter  who had been sleeping off his sorrows  physical and mental  came into the cavern  they were short of meat  he said  and with the leave of the baas he would take the gun of the dead baas and try to shoot a buck leonard bade him go  but to be back by sundown  as he should require his help where shall we dig a hole  baas  asked the dwarf one is dug  answered leonard  he who is dead dug it himself as the others did  we will bury him in the last pit he made looking for gold to the right of where the hut stood  it is deep and ready yes  baas  a good place though perhaps baas tom would not have worked at it so strongly had he known  wow  who knows to what end he labours but perchance it is a little near the donga  twice that hole has been flooded while baas tom was digging in it  then he would jump out  but now i have settled it  said leonard shortly  go  and be back half an hour before sundown at latest  stop  bring some of those rock lilies if you can  the baas was fond of them the dwarf saluted and went  ah  he said to himself as he waddled down the hill where he hoped to find game  ah  you do not fear men dead or living overmuch  yet  otter  it is true that you are better here in the sun  though the sun is hot  than yonder in the cave  say  otter  why does baas tom look so awful now that he is dead he who was so gentle while yet he lived  cheat did not look awful  only uglier  but then you killed cheat  and the heavens killed baas tom and set their own seal upon him  and what will baas leonard do now that his brother is dead and the basutos have run away  go on digging for the yellow iron which is so hard to find  and of which  when it is found  no man can even make a spear  nay  what is that to you  otter  what the baas does you do and here be the spoor of an impala buck otter was right  the day was fearfully hot  it was summer in east africa  or rather autumn  the season of fever  thunder and rain  a time that none who valued their lives would care to spend in those latitudes searching for gold with poor food and but little shelter  but men who seek their fortunes are not chary of hazarding their own lives of those of others  they become fatalists  not avowedly perhaps  but unconsciously  those who are destined to die must die  they think  the others will live  and  after all  it does not greatly matter which they do  for  as they know well  the world will never miss them when leonard outram  his brother  and two companions in adventure heard from the natives that at a particular spot on the mountains  nominally in the portuguese territory near the lowest branch of the zambesi  gold could be dug out like iron ore  and when  at the price of two tower muskets and a half bred greyhound  they received a concession from the actual chief of that territory to dig up and possess the gold without let or hindrance from any person whatsoever  they did not postpone their undertaking because the country was fever stricken and the unhealthy season drew on  in the first place  their resources were not great at the moment  and in the second  they feared lest some other enterprising person with three tower muskets and two grey hounds should persuade the chief to rescind their concession in his favour so they journeyed laboriously to the place of hidden wealth  and with the help of such native labour as they could gather began their search at first they were moderately successful  indeed  wherever they dug they found colour  and once or twice stumbled upon pockets of nuggets  their hopes ran high  but presently one of the four askew by name sickened and died of fever  they buried him and persevered with varying luck  then a second member of their party  johnston  was taken ill  he lingered for a month and died also after this leonard was for abandoning the enterprise  but  as fate would have it  on the day following johnston s death they found gold in very promising quantities  and his brother  whose desire to win the wealth necessary was only increased by many disappointments  would not listen to such advice so they rebuilt the hut on a higher and healthier spot and stayed  but on one unfortunate day thomas outram went out shooting  and losing his path in the bush was forced to spend a night in the fever fog  a week afterwards he complained of sickness and pains in the back and head three weeks later he died as we have seen all these events and many others antecedent passed through leonard s mind as he wore out the long hours seated by the side of his dead brother  never before had he felt so lonely  so utterly desolate  so bankrupt of all love and hope  it was a fact that at this moment he had no friend in the wide world  unless he could call the knob nosed native otter a friend  he had been many years away from england  his few distant relations there troubled themselves no more about him or his brother  outcasts  wanderers in strange lands  and his school and college companions in all probability had forgotten his existence there was one indeed  jane beach  but since that night of parting  seven years ago  he had heard nothing of her  twice he had written  but no answer came to his letters  then he gave up writing  for leonard was a proud man  moreover he guessed that she did not reply because she could not  as he had said to his brother  jane might be dead by now  or more probably married to mr  cohen  and yet once they had loved each other and to this hour he still loved her  or thought that he did  at least through all the weary years of exile  labour  and unceasing search after the unattainable  her image and memory had been with him  a distant dream of sweetness  peace  and beauty  and they were with him yet though nothing of her remained to him except the parting gift of her prayer book and the lock of hair within it  the wilderness is not a place where men can forget their earliest love  no  he was alone absolutely and utterly alone  a wanderer in wild lands  a sojourner with rough unlettered men and savages and now  what should he do  this place was played out  there was alluvial gold indeed  but leonard knew to day that it was not in the earth  but in the veins of quartz which permeated the mountains  that the real wealth must be sought for  and how could he extract it from the quartz without machinery or capital  besides  his kaffir servants had deserted him  worn out with hard work and fever  and there were no others to be had at this season  well  it was only one more disappointment  he must go back to natal and take his chance  at the worst he could always earn his living as a transport rider  and at the best he wearied of this search for wealth which was to build up their family afresh then of a sudden leonard remembered what he had promised to go on seeking till he died  very good  he would keep the promise till he died  and he remembered also that curious prophecy to which thomas had given utterance on the previous night  that prophecy of wealth which should come to him of course it was nothing but the distraught fancy of a dying man  for many years his brother had brooded over this possibility of gaining riches  not for their own sake indeed  but that it might be the means of restoring the ancient family  which their father had brought to shame and ruin  it was not wonderful in a man of his excitable temperament that at the hour of his death he should have grasped at some vision of attainment of the object of his life  though by the hand of another and yet how strangely he had looked at him  with what conviction he had spoken  but all this was beside the point  he  leonard  had sworn an oath many years ago  and only last night he had promised to continue to observe that oath  therefore  come good or ill  he must pursue it to the end thus he mused till he grew weary as he sat hour after hour by the side of that rigid thing  which had been his playmate  his brother  and his friend  from time to time he rose and walked about the cave  as the afternoon waned the air grew hotter and stiller  while a great cloud gathered on the horizon there will be thunder at sundown  said leonard aloud  i wish that otter would come back  so that we might get the funeral over  otherwise we shall have to wait till to morrow at length  about half an hour before nightfall  the dwarf appeared at the mouth of the cave  looking more like a gnome than a man against the lurid background of the angry sky  a buck was tied across his enormous shoulders  and in his hand he held a large bunch of the fragrant mountain lilies then the two of them buried thomas outram  there in his lonely grave which he himself had dug by the gully  and the roll of the thunder was his requiem  it seemed a fitting termination to his stormy and laborious life chapter v otter gives counsel when the burial was finished and thomas outram slept his last sleep beneath six feet of earth and stones  his brother took out the prayer book that jane beach had given him  which in truth formed all his library  and read the funeral service over the grave  ending it by the glare of the lightning flashes  then he and otter went back to the cave and ate  speaking no word  after they had done their meal leonard called to the dwarf  who took his food at a little distance otter  he said  setting the lantern between them  you are a faithful man and clever in your way  i would tell you a story and ask you something  at the least  he added to himself in english  in such a matter your judgment is as good as mine speak on  baas  said the dwarf  my ears are open  and he squatted down on the further side of the lantern like some great toad  watching his master s face with his black eyes otter  the baas who is dead and i journeyed to this country about seven years ago  before we came here we had been rich men  chiefs in our own place  but we lost our kraals and cattle and lands  they were sold others took them and we became poor  yes  we who were fat grew lean as trek oxen at the end of winter  then we said to each other  here we have no longer any home  the shame of poverty has come upon us  we are broken vessels  empty men of no account  also we are chiefs by blood and here we cannot let ourselves out to labour like the common people lest both the common people and the nobles should make a mock of us  our great stone kraal that has been ours for many generations is taken from us  others dwell in it  strange women order it  and their children shall move about the land  we will go away the blood is the blood  broke in otter  the wealth is nothing  that comes and goes  but the blood is always the blood  why did you not gather an impi  my father  and put these
